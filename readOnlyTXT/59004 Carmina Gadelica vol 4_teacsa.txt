EDITOR’S NOTE

THE aim which I held constantly before me while preparing the third volume was that it should be as nearly as possible as the Collector himself would have made it. His accounts of the reciters and his conversations with them, his notes on customs and observances, his few finished translations—all that he had written I conserved as scrupulously as the poems themselves; and my contribution, the translating of most of the poems and the compiling of the notes, was accommodated to his usage so far as lay in my power, in order that the volume might be in substance and spirit, as well as in form, the true companion of its predecessors.

Here I have pursued the same end not less keenly, though it has been more difficult of achievement. The original Gaelic, whether poetry or prose, has been reproduced with equal fidelity, and the translations framed with no less care. But there may have been included, and in a position of prominence, some matter which my grandfather might either have omitted or have presented in another context, better befitting its kind. A few of even the more elevated and curious hymns which I have printed he might have thought it needless to publish, considering that they resemble others in this and earlier volumes; and for some slighter verses he might have preferred to find a place in such a section as completes the second volume, where he could have used them to illustrate some of his own incomparable annotations of words. I could not permit myself such freedom. In these questions of selection and arrangement I claim only to have used my best judgment, bearing in mind the nature of the

[DA 6]

remaining material and the plan of the final volume; and I believe that the reader will uphold me, and that, in particular, he will not regret the inclusion of some verse and prose which the title of the book scarcely covers.

In the task of selection Mr William Matheson has given me the benefit of his wide knowledge of Gaelic poetry, printed and unprinted. He also read a proof of the whole volume, and gave me information on a number of points. I am most grateful for this valuable help.

There are more prose notes in this volume than in the last. These are compiled from many random jottings, unrevised and unrelated with each other. But they are left in the writer’s own words, and they are reliable; they contain everything of importance that he recorded on the subject, and nothing that he did not.

The matter yet to be published consists of a large body of prose and verse concerning fairies and other supernatural beings; some miscellaneous poetry; proverbs, riddles, and similar lore; notes on some hundreds of words; and (from the editor’s hand) the indices, in particular that of the rare or otherwise noteworthy words throughout the work, some of which need discussion. All this should fill a volume of like size with the others. A more minute description of the originals and a more particular account of the method of edition should also be given.

Dr MacLeod’s appreciation of my grandfather was written for the Celtic Review at the time of his death. Its significance to the reader of this book has been, not lessened, but increased, by time. Its beauty of thought and language no one can fail to mark; it is its truth that I should like to emphasise. I do not mean merely its veracity in relating facts; it is truthful in that, but it is true also in the deeper sense, such a picture as those who knew most about the Collector cannot re-read without fresh admiration for its extraordinary sureness and delicacy of touch, and such as the stranger may accept without

[DA 7]

questioning any part. And lest the reader be unfamiliar with the Gaelic world which the pages of Carmina Gadelica reflect, let me say further that it interprets not only the Collector, but his book; and not only the book, but the people in that aspect which the Collector loved and which his book enshrines, that higher side of them to which poetry and religion belong; for here the Collector, the book, and the people are of one mind and one spirit, and it is the mind and spirit in which the appreciation too was written.

The late Professor Mackinnon’s sketch of Dr Carmichael’s life, which likewise appeared in the Celtic Review, is also of permanent value. Nor do I make any apology for having included a short account of his wife, without which no account of himself could be complete. I regret only that I have not been able to do her full justice. For some information about her early years I am indebted to the Very Rev. John E. MacRae, Rector of Invergowrie and Dean of Brechin, whose maternal grandmother, Anne Fraser, was sister to my grandmother’s mother.

Of the origin and history of these hymns and charms and incantations the Collector himself has left us his thoughts in sentences which illumine the mind and quicken the imagination more than any closer discussion is likely to do. Nor is this the place or the season to attempt it. They are ‘the product of far-away thinking, come down on the long stream of time.’ None can doubt it. ‘Who the thinkers and whence the stream, who can tell?’ Yet, when the time comes, minute study will reveal more than might at first be hoped. Professor O’Rahilly has noticed the close kinship, suggestive of a common origin, between the poem collected in Barra, Ìos! Aon-ghin Mhic Dhé Athar agus Uain,* and that found in Irish manuscripts at least as old as the early eighteenth century, A Íosa, ’s a Naoimhsprid, is a Athir, is a Uain.† The Sea Prayer which closes the first volume is a version of that printed by

† Búrdúin Bheaga, § 38.

[DA 8]

John Carswell in 1567.* These matters, however, I raise only to indicate the kind of work that may some day be done. It is as literature, and noble literature, that these poems make their highest appeal; and he is little to be envied in whom it wakens no response. They have beauties and graces which are at once apparent, and others they yield only to a faithful lover. ‘These poems are in verse of a high order, with metre, rhythm, assonance, alliteration, and every quality to please the ear and to instruct the mind’; so says the Collector, and goes on to speak of ‘the simple dignity, the charming grace, and the passionate devotion of the original.’ How true is the claim let but one verse bear witness.

Is tu reula gach oidhche,
Is tu soillse gach maidne,
Is tu sgeula gach aoighe,
Is tu faighneachd gach fearainn.

Thou art the star of every night,
Thou art the brightness of every morn,
Thou art the tidings of every guest,
Thou art the enquiry of every land.†

Delicate and moving the rhythm seems to me to be, sustaining the impassioned thought, winning the ear with its lingering stress on each long vowel; the rimes are rich; the short vowels of the end-words maidne and fearainn, contrasting with the long vowels that precede them, give decision and power; the final alliteration seems to consummate the whole. Nor would it be easy, perhaps, to find in another language a verse containing more of lofty sense in words so simple and so few. Here are style, diction, rhythm, sound, and sense. ‘If this be not poetry, may the name perish!’

ALEXANDER CARMICHAEL, LL.D.

BY THE LATE PROFESSOR DONALD MACKINNON

ALEXANDER CARMICHAEL was born in the island of Lismore, on 1st December 1832. His remote ancestors seem to have been connected with the Columban church established in Lismore by St Mo-Luag. Its cathedral, of which the nave still survives as the parish church, was built by Bishop Carmichael—an tEasbaig Bàn, the fair-haired Bishop—a remote relative of Alexander Carmichael. A college for the education of priests was maintained in the island until just before Dr Carmichael’s time, and one has heard him tell how warm a welcome he got in Uist from Father MacGregor who, as one of the last batch of students educated in Lismore, had been a frequent visitor at the house of Dr Carmichael’s parents.

The family also held some land in the island, and the head of the house was known as Baran Taigh a’ Sgurrain, the Baron of Sguran House. Dr Carmichael used to tell very amusingly the story of how Black Donald Campbell of Airds, Domhnall Dubh nan Aird, after paying great attention to the young baron, wiled his land from him in exchange for a sack of gold which was afterwards found to be the new copper coinage, judiciously mixed with a few pieces of gold. Thus cheated out of their inheritance, the family settled down to farming, in which occupation they continued till the time of our folklorist.

In his youth Alexander Carmichael had wished to enter the army, and having relationship with several of the Campbell

[DA 22]

houses, such as Dunstaffnage, Lochnell, Baleveolan and Barbreck, he had been promised a commission by the Duke of Argyll. The early death of his father changed the boy’s career, however, and it being necessary for him to get settled in life, he was persuaded to accept a nomination for the Civil Service, obtained through the influence of his uncle, the minister of Durness. The parish school was supplemented by the Greenock Academy, and by a collegiate school in Edinburgh, and in due time Alexander Carmichael satisfied the Civil Service Commissioners. Greenock, Dublin, Islay, Cornwall, Skye, Uist, Oban, Uist again, and lastly, for the sake of his children’s education, Edinburgh—these were the scenes of his official life.

From his boyhood he had taken more than a passing interest in the lore and the landmarks of his race, and he early began to write systematically. It was in Uist, however, that he reached his full development and got to know, as few have ever known it, the inner life of the people. He was the friend of all. The pauper, the cottar, the crofter, the factor, the doctor, the priest, the minister—they all came to him sure of sympathy, whatever their cause of anxiety. The lorists opened their hearts to him. An idiot mother and daughter of North Uist would do for him and for those he brought with him the mystic dance of Cailleach an Dùdain, which they were always chary of doing for any one else.

In the antiquities of the Outer Isles Mr Carmichael took a great interest, and discovered several objects, the existence of which had been previously unknown, such as the runic cross from St Barr’s in Barra, now in the Antiquarian Museum, Edinburgh. To the Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland he contributed several papers on ancient buildings, underground houses, carved stones, and other subjects. Such contributions were always sent through his friends, Captain Thomas and Dr W. F. Skene. These papers were illustrated

[DA 23]

with careful drawings done by Mrs Carmichael, who from first to last helped her husband greatly in his work. The Society made Mr Carmichael a corresponding member.

Campbell of Islay sought his help, and got numerous tales and poems from him, some of which are in the West Highland Tales, and in Leabhar na Féinne, but many of which are still unpublished. To Sheriff Nicolson Mr Carmichael sent a very large number of proverbs, many of which were crowded out of the first edition of the Gaelic Proverbs, but were afterwards sent to Dr George Henderson for the new edition. To the Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, Mr Carmichael contributed valuable material, notably the Barra version of Deirdire, afterwards published in book form, and translated into French and into German. He was also a frequent contributor to the Gàidheal, to the Highlander, to the Inverness Courier, and to other magazines and newspapers. After a time, however, he practically ceased contributing to periodic literature, finding that it took too much time from his more important writing. The Celtic Review contains nearly all his occasional papers of late years.

When Dr Skene was preparing his Celtic Scotland, he asked Mr Carmichael to write the chapter on old Highland land customs. This paper first turned the attention of Lord Napier and Ettrick to the condition of the crofters, and led to Mr Carmichael being asked to write a more elaborate paper of a similar nature for the Crofter Royal Commission Report. Lord Napier used to say that those two papers had more to do with the passing of the Crofters Act than people knew. Years before, Mr Carmichael had persuaded the Board of Inland Revenue to abolish the tax on carts and on dogs kept for purposes of herding.

It would take too long to mention all Dr Carmichael’s contributions to books written or prepared by his friends, but one might mention that he contributed to Lord Archibald Campbell’s Records of Argyll, to Mr W. B. Blaikie’s Itinerary

[DA 24]

of Prince Charlie, and to the Life of Marshal MacDonald, Duke of Tarentum. He was often a good deal divided between his desire to help a friend and the feeling that he should be preparing his own material for the press, although he knew that what he had collected would not all be dealt with by himself. He always felt grateful that he had lived to see Carmina Gadelica through the press; others will feel grateful that the greater part of the new volumes has been prepared by the same hand.

Dr Carmichael was honorary president and chief of many Highland and Celtic societies. No honour that came to him gave him greater pleasure than his honorary presidency of the Celtic Societies of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St Andrews Universities. He was deeply interested in the Edinburgh University one, which in turn was warmly devoted to its Honorary President. He was never happier than in the company of the Highland lads, and for many years his house was the Saturday evening resort of the Gaelic-speaking students. When he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Edinburgh University, the Highland students took advantage of the occasion to set afoot a movement which resulted in the presentation to Dr Carmichael of full robes, hood and cap, and to Mrs Carmichael of a silver tea service. This compliment he valued at least as highly as the honour which gave rise to it.

Six years ago a Civil List pension was bestowed on Dr and Mrs Carmichael jointly, an honour which came as a great surprise to the Doctor, who had not known that friends had been interesting themselves in the matter. What pleased him most was the compliment to his wife—a graceful action apparently done on Mr A. J. Balfour’s own initiative.

Dr Carmichael passed away at his home in Edinburgh on Thursday, 6th June 1912, his ‘changing,’ as the Gaelic puts it, being peaceful and unexpected. On the following Monday he was buried, in the simple Highland manner, in

[DA 25]

St Mo-Luag’s Churchyard, in the Island of Lismore. His fellow-islesmen carried the coffin, covered with his plaid of Carmichael tartan, on their shoulders from the landing-place, and the son of the minister who had baptised him conducted a simple Gaelic service.

OUR INTERPRETER

BY THE REV. DR KENNETH MACLEOD

OTHERS will weigh and, appraise Dr Carmichael’s literary and artistic work; this is but a simple tribute from one of the folk to him who loved and interpreted the folk as none other has ever done. In the years to come, when Gaeldom as some of us have known it will have passed away, literary students will assuredly ask, What manner of man was this who preserved and interpreted so much of the ancient thought and character of his race? The answer may partly be found in Carmina Gadelica, for into its pages the author breathed much of his own remarkable personality; but to be even fairly complete, the answer needs to be supplemented by such as knew and loved the author both in public and in private.

Mr W. Skeoch Cumming has given us a portrait of the man which is both true and striking, and which has earned for the artist himself the giatitude of all readers of Carmina Gadelica, and will earn for him still greater gratitude from our children. If one may put into words what the artist has put so much more vividly on canvas, what one saw first and last in Dr Carmichael’s personal appearance was a fine stateliness touched with emotion. When he entered a room, every eye seemed to say: This is a great Celtic gentleman, one who has lived in statelier and courtlier days. But such as knew him could always see the tenderness glowing through the stateliness, though the one never really blotted out the other. In his most tender moments, he was the stately gentleman; in his stateliest moods he attracted through his tender-

[DA 28]

ness. It is difficult to get an English word to describe him exactly, though in Gaelic one would naturally use the word uasal—high thoughts and high deeds transfiguring person and manner. Seeing him, one thought of his own beautiful words: ‘It is the product of far-away thinking, come down on the long stream of time. Who the thinkers and whence the stream, who can tell? Some of the hymns may have been composed within the cloistered cells of Derry and Iona, and some of the incantations among the cromlechs of Stonehenge and the standing-stones of Callarnis.’ What Dr Carmichael was and looked had its root, however, in the present as well as in the past. To save what he could of the folk-literature of Gaeldom, he had sacrificed not merely his prospects, but also to a large extent his means, and of what remained not all was spent on himself or on his family. In Uist, which forty or fifty years ago was even poorer than it is to-day, he paid the excise dues and filled the meal-chest of many a poor crofter and of many a poorer cottar, and the very day he left the island to take up his residence on the mainland, he was suddenly called on to pay an account amounting to within a few shillings of one hundred pounds for stores ordered on behalf of people whose own orders would have been dishonoured by the merchants. Nor did he ever allow himself to be far away from the wood financially; again and again he would return to it to help some fellow-Gael in distress. Especially was this the case during his residence in Edinburgh. Some man of good, perhaps of famous, Hebridean blood was unfortunate in his business or broke down in health—Dr Carmichael sacrificed part of his very moderate capital to keep the man afloat. A university student was unable to finish his session, and was practically starving himself to eke out what little money he had—Dr Carmichael always found a gentleman’s excuse to get such an one to become a member of his family. Seldom, indeed, was the stranger’s place empty at the Doctor’s table; only, the stranger was always as a

[DA 29]

son, and kept possession of his seat until the need was over, or until the situation was secured, or until some bad habit was got rid of. About such things he was proudly and tenderly silent himself; proudly and tenderly let such things be told now, if only to remind ourselves that even fame must receive its crown at the hands of goodness.

To show the place given by the folk to Alexander Carmichael, one has to compare him with some of our other great ones. Through the West Highland Tales Campbell of Islay gained for our folklore a European reputation; but in spite of his patriotism and his charming manners, he was never quite one of us—he could never altogether hide the fact that he had learnt his art with other peoples and in other schools. And though he doubtless loved our tales and our beliefs for their own sake, yet: ‘The following collection is intended to be a contribution to this new science of “Storyology.” It is a museum of curious rubbish about to perish, given as it was gathered in the rough.’ In another field, that of philology, Dr Alexander MacBain was our greatest man. We were all proud of him; such of us as had been his pupils, or otherwise knew him intimately, loved him; and whether we knew him personally or not, we all accepted as gospel whatever he said ex cathedra. And yet one could never quite get rid of the feeling that in temperament he was Teutonic rather than Celtic, and that the scientist in him was always stronger than the Gael, as was really the case. Our feeling for Alexander Carmichael was both in kind and in degree different from our feeling for Campbell or for MacBain. He was essentially one of ourselves, only greater, flesh of our flesh, blood of our blood, soul of our soul. Thus we never thought of him as one merely collecting and dissecting our beliefs in the more or less sacred name of science; we thought of him rather as one who saw with our eyes, who felt with our heart, and who reproduced our past because he loved it himself and was proud of it. He, on his part, spoke of our

[DA 30]

cult, of our ways, of our beliefs; he seldom spoke of our ‘superstitions’—never, indeed, in his later days. What our race thought as to the relations of man to man, and of man to the world and to the other-worlds, was all sacred in his eyes; the broken cry of the pagan as well as the stately Praise of Iona, the unconscious worship of God through His sun and through His moon, as well as the conscious worship of God through Him who was born of the Virgin Mary. St Columba, in our great days, grafted the vine on to the oak: who are we, then, and what are we, that we should be wiser than our best?

It is sometimes said that Dr Carmichael idealised us; not merely our past, which was allowable, being borne out by the beautiful material he had collected, but also our present, which itself contradicts his picture of it; that he idealised, at any rate, such of us as had passed the threescore years, and more particularly such of them as had a tale to tell or a rune to chant. One does not care to deny so pleasant a charge. Every man makes his own world, to the extent, at any rate, of unconsciously reading himself into it; and thus the worse the reality idealised, the better the man who idealises. It would be equally correct, however, to say that Dr Carmichael had the prophet’s eye to see beyond our faults and to find what of goodly thought and sentiment lay behind. In this he was of the same mould as St Columba, whose two eyes, it is said, were so warm that they could always melt the shell which hid the kernel. Dr Carmichael had just that same power—his sympathy and his tenderness never failed to get straight to the kernel. This was true of him both in his dealings with the folk and in his interpretation of the lore taken down from the folk. Campbell of Islay and his coadjutor, Hector Maclean, could get the heroic tales and ballads, the things which were recited in public at the céilidh; only Alexander Carmichael could have got the hymns and the incantations, the things which were said when

[DA 31]

the door was closed, and the lights were out. Even Father Allan MacDonald of Eriskay had his limits as a collector; the very fact that he was the anam-chara, the soul-friend, of his people, closed certain doors against him. In matters of the heart and of the soul, the folk, as every collector knows, can be reticent and secretive to a baffling degree, but in Dr Carmichael’s dealings with them, the tenderness which could get was delicate as the reticence which would hide. Even his great book, Carmina Gadelica, does not show the full extent of his intimacy with the folk and their childlike confidence in his sympathy. Not all of what he learned was written down, or if written down, has been preserved; many curious rites, embodied in unusual language, the outpourings of simple hearts in less conventional days, were revealed to him under a strict pledge of secrecy—a pledge which, needless to say, has been faithfully kept. A characteristic instance is within the writer’s knowledge. One evening a venerable Islesman, carried out of himself for the time being, allowed Dr Carmichael to take down from him a singularly beautiful ‘going into sleep’ rune; early next morning the reciter travelled twenty-six miles to exact a pledge that his ‘little prayer’ should never be allowed to appear in print. ‘Think ye,’ said the old man, ‘if I slept a wink last night for thinking of what I had given away. Proud, indeed, shall I be, if it give pleasure to yourself, but I should not like cold eyes to read it in a book.’ In the writer’s presence the manuscript was handed over to the reciter, to be burnt there and then—but for days and nights after, the music of that rune haunted two men!

The glow of sympathy which made Dr Carmichael great as a collector made him still greater as an interpreter of the material collected. Nothing seemed too elusive for him to grasp or too occult for him to pierce—the Columban eye hardly ever failed to melt the shell which concealed. Discussing this very point, Father Allan MacDonald, himself

[DA 32]

one of our great collectors, once remarked to the writer: I read the Carmina in Gaelic, but again and again I lay down the book, and say to myself, “This is a dubh-fhacal, a dark saying!—who can understand it?” Then I look at Carmichael’s translation, and I say at once, “Of course, it means that—it could mean nothing else.”’ An obvious explanation would be that Dr Carmichael was specially gifted for a special kind of work; which is true so far. But this special gift was really of a piece with the rest of his character. It has already been pointed out that the tender-hearted sympathy which made him the great collector and interpreter he was showed in his life as well as in his work. He had what can only be described as a beautiful mania for setting things right, and for unravelling the tangles in the lives as well as in the lore of the folk. Was there someone suffering from lack of appreciation? Dr Carmichael wrote and spoke and laboured on his behalf. Was there someone in a worse position than his ability seemed to merit? The Doctor would try to move heaven and earth to get promotion for such an one. To many, indeed, it must have been a revelation to find how he would go out of his way to do things for others which neither his pride nor his modesty would allow him to do for himself or for his own. He never learned to be worldly-wise in such matters; his temperament rushed into quixotry, or what often goes by that name, as naturally as the plant grows towards the sun. And finer even than his loyalty to the living was his loyalty to the dead. It was always in his heart, for instance, to write an adequate appreciation of Sheriff Alexander Nicolson of the Gaelic Proverbs, feeling strongly that scant justice had been done to a great soul in Dr Walter C. Smith’s biography of him. The same loyalty prompted him to do justice to the memory of reciters whom he had never seen, but of whom he had heard, or whose lore he had taken down from the lips of others. Thus in his introduction to the ‘Invocation of the Graces,’ he describes, not

[DA 33]

only the man from whom he got the poem, but also the woman from whom the man had got it ‘in the long ago.’ But one need not dwell on this aspect of Dr Carmichael’s character further than to say that there are scores of people, some of them very humble, both on the mainland and in the Isles, who have good cause to know how dear to his heart was the memory of their lost ones. His very last letter, two days before he passed away, was one of condolence with an old friend, and of tender chiding because he had not been given the opportunity of travelling from Edinburgh to the Isles to pay his last tribute to the departed. In the eyes of the folk the fear-dùthcha, the good countryman, is he who is loyal both to the living and to the dead.

Heart-love for his people and intense sympathy with their ways and their thoughts made Dr Carmichael our greatest collector and interpreter; but it was quite another quality which clinched his aim for him. It is doubtful if there can be found, in the whole literary history of the Gael, such another instance of gentle yet iron persistency in following out an aim, in realising a dream. What to others was a trip or at most a pilgrimage, was to Dr Carmichael a life-long quest; his keenness, his determination, in pressing towards the mark can hardly be exaggerated. What he failed to get in Uist he searched for in Glen Garry; what he lost in Kintyre he tracked in Sutherland. He might fail in the morning to get what he wanted, but there was still the evening to come, and another day, and another week, and another year; and sooner or later, he found, sure enough, the word or the line or the rite he sought. Had his motive been mere personal ambition or mere love of scientific research, he could never have so persevered, so toiled. The driving force must be sought elsewhere—in the blood, which alone can do such wonders—in the fealty, far-inherited, of a knight to a cause.

Year in year out, for nearly sixty years, Dr Carmichael was on pilgrimage throughout Gaeldom. To many of us

[DA 34]

he seemed, both in temperament and in activity, as one of the Iona brethren re-born in the nineteenth century. His very appearance was suggestive of Iona: the stately and venerable figure undoubtedly was, while the Scots bonnet might easily be mistaken for a biretta, the shepherd’s crook for a pastoral staff, and the long dark cloak, half-concealing the kilt, for a monk’s habit. Even his travels by land and by sea carried one back in thought to the Iona times and ways. In the Introduction to Carmina Gadelica we read: ‘Three sacrifices have been made—the sacrifice of time, the sacrifice of toil, and the sacrifice of means. These I do not regret.’ In the sacrifice of toil must be included astounding physical exertion. In the Outer Isles, Dr Carmichael’s adventures by ford and by ferry were proverbial, and were regarded with awe by a people who had oftentimes to risk, and who sometimes lost, their lives doing such things.* A few years ago, the writer had occasion to cross from the Carnach of North Uist to the Island of Balishare, and before venturing on to the strand, he took the precaution to ask if it was fordable. ‘It is and it is not,’ was the answer; ‘it is but a Carmichael ford as yet!’ The writer got across fairly wet about half an hour after! One of Dr Carmichael’s fording adventures deserves special mention. He was crossing, after nightfall, from South Uist to his home in Benbecula, by what is called the South Ford. The night was one of black mistiness, the ford what is known in Uist as ‘the ford of the coming storm,’ and as Mr Carmichael, as he then was, waded nearly breast-high through one salt stream after another, all he was conscious of was the roll and the singing of waters, and the rhythm of a poem he had taken down a few hours before.

Is sùilean thu dh’an dall,
Is crann dh’an deòraidh thruagh.

Eyes art thou to the blind,
A staff to the pilgrim lone.


* Dr Carmichael’s successor was drowned in the North Ford.

[DA 35]

This poem, rescued on shore and nearly lost at sea in one and the same evening, was none other than Ora nam Buadh, ‘The Invocation of the Graces,’ a composition said to be unique in the literature of Europe.

Travelling waves and fords was ease, however, compared with travelling the wilds in which the ancient lore had found its last refuge on the mainland. Dr Carmichael was often seen on the king’s highway; he might have been seen oftener, had there been people to see, on the sheep-track and on the bridle-path, and on the path which sheep had never marked and which bridle had never trod. Ostensibly his reason was, to shorten the distance and to save time; in reality he preferred the roads that had been, partly because of their natural beauty, but mostly because of their tendency to lead to an old ruin, or to some remote family in which the ancient ways and things were still cherished. Sometimes, however, he had the best of all reasons for his choice of the difficult path—the simple reason that there was none other! Only two years ago, Dr Carmichael, then in his seventy-seventh year, went on a collecting pilgrimage throughout the northern counties, in the course of which he met with hardships which would have strained to the utmost the strength of a strong man in his prime. Once he had to spend the night, cold, wet, and tired, in the open air; more than once, after a long journey through peat-hags and corries, he had to pass the night as best he could on a hard chair by the fireside of some shepherd’s hut. A painfully real one, this sacrifice of toil, physically as well as mentally; it meant oftener than one cares to think, hunger and cold, footsore days and sleepless nights. And yet one never felt this in listening to Dr Carmichael’s own account of his travels; he cast over them a glamour which made one long to seize the crook and to take to the road that same evening. The very names he mentioned made one’s blood tingle. ‘I have come from Gress, round by Tolasta to the south and Tolasta to the north,

[DA 36]

taking a look at the ruins of the church of St Aula at Gress, and at the ruins of the fort of Dùn Othail, and then across the moorland.’ Or, ‘Passing through the great Ford of Uist, I had another look, for love of the old days, at St Michael’s Oratory in Grimsay, then went on to Carinish, and stood for a while in the Temple of the Trinity, and would have crossed over to the Temple of Christ in Balishare, had the tide permitted.’ Or, ‘There are still dear good people in Moidart, who have not forgotten the ways and the thoughts of the fathers. Sailing up Loch Shiel, I saluted St Finnan’s Isle in the passing, and in due time got as far as Morar. I met an aged Knoydart woman there who has much lore. A beautiful woman.’ And once more, ‘These strands are dear to me, the Strand of St Barr in Barra, the Strand of St Michael in South Uist, the Strand of St Mary in North Uist, and the Strand of St Clement in Harris.’ Our folk could always make poems out of names; dreams, too, when in exile; both in the one and in the other our interpreter followed the blood.

Of Sir Walter Scott Cardinal Newman said that he had set ‘before them visions which, when once seen, were not easily forgotten.’ Many of us can say the same of Dr Alexander Carmichael. He has filled our heart with dreams, and our ear with a strangely familiar music. We ask ourselves:—

Who is she, the melodious lady-lord,
At the base of the knoll,
At the mouth of the wave?

And the folk-heart in us says:—

From Erin she travelled,
For Lochlann is bound,
May the Trinity travel with her
Whithersoever she goes
Whithersoever she goes.

Again and again, too, we get vivid glimpses of people whose

[DA 37]

faces we recognise, even though it be what is called in Gaelic aithne gun chuimhne, recognition without remembrance. These, for instance:—But Mary Macrae heeded not, and went on in her own way, singing her songs and ballads, intoning her hymns and incantations, and chanting her own “port-a-bial,” mouth-music, and dancing to her own shadow, when nothing better was available.’—‘Being then but a child he could not follow the meaning of this lore, but he thought many times since that much of it must have been about the wild beliefs and practices of his people of the long, long ago, and perhaps not so long ago either. Many of the poems and stories were long and weird, and he could only remember fragments, which came up to him as he lay awake, thinking of the present and the past, and of the contrast between the two, even in his own time.’—‘Birds and beasts, reptiles and insects, whales and fishes, talked and acted through her in the most amusing manner, and in the most idiomatic Gaelic. Her stories had a charm for children, and it was delightful to see a small cluster of little ones pressing round the narrator, all eyes, all ears, all mouth, and all attention, listening to what the bear said to the bee, the fox to the lamb, the harrier to the hen, the serpent to the pipit, the whale to the herring, and the brown otter of the stream to the silvery grilse of the current. Those fair young heads, now, alas! widely apart, probably remember some of the stories heard at Janet Campbell’s knee better than those they afterwards heard in more formal schools.’ Such pictures reveal to us, as in a flash, the men and women of old Gaeldom, with their humour and their pathos, their wistfulness and their tenderness. And hardly less human or interesting are the beasts and the birds of Carmina Gadelica—the swan, the teal, the grey crow, the fox, even the humble beetle. They are all of our race, and can talk and laugh, jest and moralise, with the best of us. For genuine Gaelic humour it would be difficult to get anything better than, for instance, the story of the oyster-

[DA 38]

catcher and the grey crow in the introduction to ‘The Genealogy of Bride.’ How real, too, Dr Carmichael makes the old Gaelic festivals to us—St Michael’s, St Bride’s, St Columba’s; here with a wealth of detail, there with a few deft touches. Fortunately for one’s consistency, one does not need to choose between the secular and the sacred in Carmina Gadelica, for they are so intertwined as to be not really two but one. And what a world that is into which the master guide leads us! so intensely human, yet so frankly superhuman; so one-racial, yet so all-racial; so wildly primitive, yet so beautifully cultured and gentle; its head always on earth, its heart always in heaven. Who can set a limit to the influence of such a work? We know that by his writings Alexander Carmichael contributed largely to the passing of the Crofters Act, the magna charta, economically, of the modern Gael; reading those same writings, and others by that same man, our children will, perhaps, dream dreams and see visions in the croftland, and dreaming and seeing add another verse to the unfinished song.

We all in our measure appreciate the runes and the poems of Carmina Gadelica, but we can never love them or appreciate them as Dr Carmichael himself did. They were part of his being—the very heart and soul of him. Some of us have spent memorable evenings in his study, and have seen the glow on his face, and have heard the break in his voice, as he intoned poem after poem, or the same poem time after time, utterly regardless of the world which eats and drinks and counts time. And if the fire went out, as it always did, or if the daylight faded, as it could not help doing, the doctor would throw a bundle of sticks into the grate, set them ablaze, and then, drawing on his marvellous memory, go on rolling out, in the fine baritone voice so much admired by musicians, haunting lines and verses from the poems, until, from sheer emotion, he had to stop, after which one heard soft quavers: ‘The dear people! the dear people!’

[DA 39]

It was at such times one understood whence Carmina Gadelica, whence its dialect, whence its sumptuousness. He had thought of writing the poems in the recognised literary form; he so wrote out several, but to his sensitive ear the music had quite gone out of them. The explanation is a simple one. Many of the hymns were sung to a strangely beautiful kind of music which is now becoming known through the labours of Mrs Kennedy Fraser, some were intoned, and some recited in a curiously rhythmic monotone, and as genuine singing must always be a compromise between the music and the language, the folk often changed (not always unconsciously) the form and the sound of words, for the sake of beauty of utterance in singing or intoning. Thus many of the unusual forms in Carmina Gadelica are simply words worn and polished by the sea of music, and were reproduced by Dr Carmichael, partly out of loyalty to the men and women who had so chanted and crooned them, but chiefly owing to the loss of musical sound when standard spelling and pronunciation were attempted. To the intensity of his admiration for the folk must also be credited the sumptuousness of Carmina Gadelica—the quality of the paper, the beauty of the lettering, the stateliness of the whole. The richness of the volumes was really his estimate of the folk whose ways and thoughts the volumes enshrined. A gem of the first water, come down as an heirloom from the fathers—such was his conviction; it must have a setting worthy of its value and of its associations—such was his determination. These considerations induced him to abandon his original intention of issuing the work at the price of a very few shillings. It was a characteristically beautiful thing to do, and we may well be grateful that he did it; none the less grateful though we express the hope that sooner rather than later, the treasures of the book may be brought within easy reach of all who love the beautiful and the good. Such was Dr Carmichael’s own wish and intention.

One would fain go on writing about the life and the work of the most fascinating character some of us have ever known —so stately in person and in manner, so tender in heart, so constant in purpose, so passionately devoted to a cause. For us he has done a great work, although his own verdict was, ‘Say, rather, that the people have done a great work for Alexander Carmichael.’ Let the two, however, live side by side—one in blood and in fame. He was happy in his life—surrounded by ones who helped to make even labour and sacrifice sweet for him throughout the years; he was peaceful in his end—his last act, too sacred to mention, beautiful for tenderness and thoughtfulness. As we laid him in rest, we sang a psalm of thanksgiving,* not of affliction. And one who loved him said, ‘Never in my life have I felt so proud; he lived such a magnificently honourable life (the grave in Lismore is but an incident in it), something due to his ancestors and to his own island.’ And yet, as we think of Gaeldom, another thought creeps in and makes us forget all else—the thought of the disciple who loved St Columba: ‘Cold and empty the church to-day—he is not at the altar.’

MARY FRANCES MACBEAN

MY grandmother’s forebears for many centuries had belonged to the Black Isle in Ross. Her father was Kenneth MacBean (or MacBain), civil engineer, of Kessock Ferry, and her mother Elizabeth Fraser, daughter of John Fraser of the Ness, Chanonry. John Fraser, her maternal grandfather, had been an employee of Broadwood the piano-maker in London, and, retiring to his native croft, his own ancestral property, became the Inspector of Poor in Fortrose. Her father was alive at the time of her marriage, but her mother died while she was still a child, and she had neither sister nor brother. The year of her birth was 1841.

On her mother’s death she found a new home. Her people, like many others in the district, were of the Scottish Episcopal Church, and her mother’s sister, Anne Fraser, was the wife of the Rev. Arthur Ranken, priest of Old Deer and later Dean of the united Dioceses of Aberdeen and Orkney.* She became for the time an adopted child of Dean Ranken’s house, and went with his daughters to the College for Girls established at Crieff by Canon Alexander Lendrum, the Episcopal clergyman there—a school co-eval with Trinity College, Glen Almond, and similar to it in purpose, but not now in existence. From the Parsonage of Old Deer, and probably not long after leaving school, she went to be housekeeper and secretary to the revered Bishop Alexander Penrose Forbes† at his house of Castlehill, Dundee, and at Burntisland

[DA 42]

in Fife. Of Dean Ranken and Bishop Forbes, the guardians of her early life, she often spoke with affection and regard, and it was clear that they had exercised a profound influence upon her.

She was living at Burntisland with Bishop Forbes at the time of her marriage to Alexander Carmichael, but it was in the Isles that they first met—according to old people in Barra and Uist, when visiting the lighthouse of Barra Head, or Bernera of Barra, the southernmost link of the Long Island chain. They were married on 13th January 1868, in a private house in Edinburgh, by the Rev. Dr Thomas M‘Lauchlan, minister of St Columba’s Gaelic church. Alexander Carmichael was thirty-six, his wife twenty-seven. He was at that time stationed at Lochmaddy, North Uist, and their first home was the Manse of Trumisgarry; they removed thence in May 1871 to Creagorry in Benbecula, thence for six years to Scolpaig in North Uist, and in 1882 permanently to Edinburgh. Thus their home was in the Isles for only fourteen of the forty-four years of their married life. During that time, however, they enjoyed some freedom of movement, and my grandmother came to know not only Barra and the Uists, but also some at least of the islands of Argyll; for my mother was born, not in Uist, but in her father’s island of Lismore, at the farm of Cill Anndraist, of which her grandfather’s family were still tenants. Moreover, after their removal to Edinburgh, my grandmother sometimes accompanied her husband on his frequent and often prolonged visits to the Isles.

To describe her physical appearance apart from her personality would obscure what no one who knew her could fail to notice—how the body matched the spirit. It seemed that the spirit had moulded mortal clay to its own use. She was slight, of rather less than middle height, alert and upright of carriage, quick and eager in her walk, deft in every movement. She was not restless, her activity was purposeful; but even when at leisure she seemed ready to begin work at a

[DA 43]

moment’s notice, like a small ship with clean and graceful lines and the decks cleared for action. This physical alertness was but the complement of her alertness and activity of mind. And so with the features—the finely shaped head well poised, the open blue eyes with a very direct and calm gaze, the gentle but resolute mouth and chin, all perfectly expressed her character. She was completely mistress of herself, and one knew instinctively that in all the stress of life the spirit had yielded never an inch to the body. To everyone around her she was the kindest and most helpful of women, but for herself she seemed to have no sympathy; in bereavement she felt for the grief of others, in painful and harassing illness she was troubled only lest she might be a burden.

Her remarkable abilities in many fields, both artistic and practical; were never allowed to lie idle. She had a number of favourite hobbies, but could turn her hand with skill to almost any undertaking, and she took a ready and keen interest in whatever study or employment presented itself in the various scenes and circumstances of her life. To be idle she could not easily endure; idleness or dullness in others she did not fail to notice, but though she disliked to see them, she would waste no time in reproof, but would promptly go and do the work herself. To children she was a delightful companion; she could teach them the innumerable things that children want to learn, from botany to woodwork, and she was never a stern judge.

Of her inner life she never spoke, still less did she ever preach. To make any verbal profession for herself was as remote from her nature as to require it from others. None the less, her whole life realised the teaching implicit in the words of Christ, ‘Even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.’ To being ministered unto she would not submit—it came nearer than anything else to making her impatient; to persuade her to spare herself, or to take any step for her own comfort, was hardly possible.

[DA 44]

To minister was her instinct and purpose, and there was neither fuss nor sentimentality, but every service was done in the quietest, most practical, most efficient possible way. All her goodness was of the serenely cheerful and sunny kind, and no one shared in laughter and fun more readily.

During the sixteen years of her widowhood she made her home with her daughter and son-in-law, among whose family she held a very special place. But no doubt the virtue of her gifts and character was still better to be seen in her own household. There she had ample scope. So far from curbing any unworldly and beautiful project that her husband cherished, she was at one with it, she forwarded it, and above all it was she who made it practicable. She never tired of the all-absorbing interest of his life—the Gaelic people and all their works and ways. Her native district breathes a very different air from that of the Isles, nor did she ever speak the Gaelic language, though it was the native language of her four children as well as of her husband; but this did not prevent her from sharing his enthusiasm. Where she could, she worked wholeheartedly along with him, for the welfare of the people or of an individual, as well as in his archæological and other practical studies; where the language itself was concerned, she ensured that he was free, mind, body and purse, for the task of collecting literature and lore.

‘Dr Carmichael,’ writes Kenneth MacLeod, ‘owed the fullness of his achievement to two women, the one his wife, the other his daughter. It was his daughter who really gave Carmina Gadelica to the world; and it was his wife who, first, by her good management made it possible for him to bear the financial strain of his adventure, and to wander about through Isles and mainland as the spirit moved him, and who, again, when the collected material was being arranged for publication, by her cultured ear and artistic hand added greatly to the beauty of the work.’ This is indeed true; and the debt to his wife, the all-embracing debt which extended

[DA 45]

far beyond the book and lay between themselves alone, he expressed without exaggeration, and with characteristic beauty, in his inscription upon her copy of Carmina Gadelica: ‘To thee, Mary, the gifted woman, the devoted mother, the perfect wife, I, thy grateful husband, owe more than words can tell.’

Mary Frances Carmichael died in December 1928, and was buried beside her husband in the churchyard of Cill Mo-Luag in Lismore.

AN DOBHARCHU: <eng>THE WATER-DOG

THE reciter was a man of much natural intelligence. The first part of what he said he gave from hearsay, but the account of the healing as fact; he had seen it done and done it himself, always successfully.

The <gai>‘dobharchu,’<eng> an animal of the otter kind, is rarely seen and still more rarely caught, and many allege that it is a mythical creature like the sea-serpent and the mermaid. It has a white spot about the size of a florin on its breast. The reciter’s account clearly supposes a difference between the <gai>‘dobharchu,’<eng> water-dog, or <gai>‘dobhran donn,’<eng> brown water-dog, and the <gai>‘biast-dubh,’<eng> black beast, black otter; but these terms are sometimes synonymous.

The otter is plentiful in the Western Isles. It was for years preserved about the island of Rona, North Uist, and is consequently especially common there. The male otter is larger than the female, and much rarer.


<gai>Is e an Dobharchu ard-rìgh nam Biasta-Dubh. Chan ’eil an Dobharchu ach tearc a measg chreutairean mara agus tìre: chan ’eil ach aon Dobharchu mu choinneamh a h-uile seachd Biasta-Dubh.

DAOL AGUS CEARRDUBHAN: <eng>GRAVEDIGGER BEETLE AND SACRED BEETLE

THE following legend concerning the <gai>‘Daol,’<eng> Gravedigger Beetle, and the <gai>‘Cearrdubhan,’<eng> Sacred Beetle, is similar to that already given (Duan nan Daol, ii. 188; Cearrdubhan, ii. 248; Daol, ii. 267).

During the flight to Egypt, when Herod’s men were in pursuit of the Holy Family, they asked those whom they passed whether they had seen Jesus. A farmer admitted that he had seen a family pass that way. ‘When?’ asked the pursuers. ‘When this corn was being sown.’ Now the corn had been sown the day before, but a miracle had been performed: the pursuers looked around, and behold the corn was ripe and yellow and ready for the sickle. As the soldiers were turning to go away the <gai>‘Daol,’<eng> Gravedigger Beetle, came across the road and said—

<gai>‘An dé, an dé
Chaidh Mac Dé seachad.’<eng>

‘Yesterday, yesterday
Went the Son of God by.’

The <gai>‘Cearrdubhan,’<eng> Sacred Beetle, however, with less regard for truth but more regard for charity, said—

<gai>‘Briag, briag, a bhradag!
Seachd bliadhna gun agadh,
Bheirinn-se mo bhriathar,
Bho’n a chaidh Mac Dhia seachad.’<eng>

‘Lie, lie, thou little thief!
Seven years without doubt,
I would give my word,
Since the Son of God went by.’

Or according to another version he said—

<gai>‘Trì Di-Aoine an déidh a chéile
Bho’n a chaidh Mac Dé seachad.’<eng>

‘Three Fridays after one another
Since the Son of God went by.’

The <gai>‘Daol’<eng> is therefore trampled on when seen, but the <gai>‘Cearrdubhan’<eng> is merely turned on his back and not further molested.

<gai>AN DEALAN-DÉ:<eng> THE GOLDEN BUTTERFLY

IT has been noted already (ii. 267 f.) that the <gai>‘Dealan-Dé,’<eng> Golden Butterfly, is said to be the angel of God come to bear the souls of the dead to heaven. The following is a rime which children repeat on seeing the Golden Butterfly.

<gai>Dhealain-Dé! Dhealain-Dé!
Co an deò thug thu fhé,
Dhealain-Dé! Dhealain-Dé!
Thug thu ’n dé do fhlathas?<eng>

Butterfly! Butterfly!
Whose the soul thou didst bear,
Butterfly! Butterfly!
Yesterday to heaven?

<gai>Ma chìthear an Dealan Buidhe ann an taigh am bheil corp, agus gun téid e tarsainn air a’ chorp anns a’ chiste chadail no air an eisin, tha anam a’ chuirp sin slàn ann am flathas. Ni bheil diù do chàcha, do ghin ach dh’an Dealan Bhuidhe.

Thubhairt Iain Mac Ruairidh, Tolorum, Beinne Bhadhla: Tha e air aithris nach robh Dealan-Dé riamh air domhan gun an tàinig Crìosda bho’n bhàs agus gun d’éirich e an aird as an uaigh. Thàthar a’ seanchas gur h-ann as an Uaigh Naoimh a thàinig a’ chiad Dealan-Dé ceart, agus gun do lìonsgaraich an Dealan-Dé sin feadh an domhain. Chan fhacas riamh an Dealan-Dé ceart a measg dhaoine dona, measg droch cuideachd, measg droch cainnt, measg droch obair, measg nì gràineil, nì tàireil, nì duairce.

Tha iomadh seòrsa Dealan-Dé ann, ach an seòrs air am bheilear a’ seanchas chan ’eil iad cho pailt. Tha an Dealan-Dé ceart faisg air leth oirleach air fad, agus tha e nas taogaiche mu’n chom na seòrs air bith eile. Tha iad comhdaichte le clòimhteach no itean ro ghrinn agus ro bheag mu earball seach seòrs eile fo’n ghréin. Tha mullach a’ chinn aca colach ri crùn rìgh le frillsneach mun cuart da.

Tha e ’na dheagh chomharra an Dealan-Dé fhaicinn air corp no faisg air corp. Tha e air aithris gu bheil gach clais agus strìoch ’na sgiathan agus ’na cheann agus ’na chom ceart dìreach ann an dòigh agus a bha an corp agus com naomh an tSlànaigheir ’na laighe anns an lìonradh.

AN COILEACH: <eng>THE COCK

THE domestic cock is sained throughout the Isles. It is perfectly trusted as an accurate time-keeper. Should a cock crow at an untimely hour it would cause uneasiness to the family. <gai>‘Ma ghlaodhas an coileach mór an am mì-iomachaidh tha mì-thuaiream mhì-fhortanach air choireigin ri tachart.’<eng>—‘If the big cock crows at an unmeet time some unfortunate mishap is to befall.’ The people differentiate, however, <gai>‘eadar guth a’ choilich bhig agus guth a’ choilich mhóir, eadar glaodh a’ choilich òig agus glaodh an t-seana-choilich,’<eng> between the voice of the big cock and

[TD 7]

the voice of the little cock, between the crow of the young cock and the crow of the old cock. <gai>‘An coileachan,’<eng> the little cock, is unreliable until he is twelve months old, but the big cock is remarkably reliable.

The cock is called by various endearing names: <gai>‘am fear faire,’<eng> the watcher; <gai>‘fear faire na h-oidhche,’<eng> the watcher of the night; <gai>‘fear faire Chrìosda,’<eng> Christ’s watcher; <gai>‘fear faire nan tràth,’<eng> the watcher of the hours; <gai>‘fear bheannachaidh na maidne,’<eng> he who blesses the morning; <gai>‘fear dhùsgadh nan naomh,’<eng> the wakener of the saints; <gai>‘fear dhùsgadh nan creidmheach (creideach),’<eng> the wakener of the believers; <gai>‘fear choimheid na h-urnaigh,’<eng> the observer of prayer; <gai>‘fear chuimhneachaidh Pheadair,’<eng> the remembrancer of Peter; <gai>‘fear bhristidh nan geasa,’<eng> the breaker of the spells. Other phrases are: <gai>‘guth fear ghabhail an rathaid,’<eng> the voice of him who takes the road; <gai>‘coileach Chonnachd,’<eng> the cock of Connacht; <gai>‘coileach Rìgh Chonnachdaich,’<eng> the cock of the King of Connacht.

No one will willingly be out and no one will willingly travel between midnight and cockcrow, <gai>‘eadar mheadhon oidhche agus gairm choileach.’<eng> This time is known as <gai>‘an tràth marbh,’ ‘tràth marbh na h-oidhche,’<eng> the dead watch, the dead watch of the night. After the cock crows all is well, and the most timid will travel in the dark <gai>‘gun eagal gun athadh,’<eng> without fear or timidity. Highlanders dislike the voice of the redcock and still more that of the blackcock when travelling at night, but the voice of the domestic cock is hailed with joy as the voice of a friend, dispelling danger and darkness and all supernatural evil from the land.

To see a cluster of hens with no cock among them is a sure sign of evil impending in the family or the flock.

A cock cannot crow unless he is free to raise his head. If it be desired to prevent his crowing he is placed in a position where he must keep his head down. A cock so treated is called <gai>‘coileach cùbaidh,’<eng> a depressed cock; <gai>‘coileach crùbaidh,’<eng> a crouched cock; <gai>‘coileach Chaluim Chille,’<eng> the cock of Columba.


Columba was travelling in Ireland. A disciple asked him at what time he was leaving. <gai>‘Nim bheil mi falbh gu gairm choileach.’<eng>—‘I am not leaving till cockcrow,’ said Columba. His emissaries brought this information to the King of Connacht, who commanded all the cocks of the townland to be placed under upturned tubs. This was done, unknown to Columba; death was the penalty for any who should inform him, for the King wished to annoy the Saint for denouncing his sins. The vigilant ear of Columba failed to hear the call of the morning cock, but his vigilant eye did not fail to see <gai>‘coilleagaich na maidne,’<eng> the glimmering of the morning, and he was up and away on his travels to tell the people of the life to come and of the hopes beyond the grave; not, however, before the King’s servile men had time to annoy and to try him sorely. Columba cursed the cocks of that townland and left it as a ban that no cock should ever crow in that place. Nor has a cock of that townland ever crowed

[TD 8]

since then, and the curse is still upon them and shall remain till the day of doom. Even a cock from elsewhere becomes mute when brought to that townland.

The Roman Catholics of Barra attribute this deception to the Protestants of Tiree, the people of Tiree to the people of Connacht, and the Christians of Connacht to the Jews of Judæa. <gai>‘Ni robh daoine Chonnachd idir co ciontach ri daoine Iudaea, glòir do Dhia air nèamh agus do naoimh air thalamh.’<eng>—‘The people of Connacht were not at all so guilty as those of Judæa, glory to God in heaven and to saints on earth,’ said a bright beautiful woman of Connacht with an alluring smile, half doubtful of her own statement. Alas, none of us are at all as other people are!


A man died <gai>‘cùl na Beinnde Móire,’<eng> behind Ben More in South Uist. His son went to the townland to make arrangements for the funeral. The old man’s body was laid out <gai>‘air an eisin, an uachdar an taighe,’<eng> on the bier, in the upper part of the house. A girl of seven years, who had never spoken before, cried out, <gai>‘A mhàthair, a mhàthair, tha mo sheanair ag éirigh!<eng>—‘Mother, mother, my grandfather is getting up!’ <gai>‘Ghabh am boireannach eagal (mar nach b’iongnadh) romh an nighinn a bha chon a seo ’na balbhan a bhruidhinn agus romh an chainnt a thubhairt i, agus fhreagair i, “Mas e seo is ciad chainnt dhusa tha an t-am againn gluasad!”’<eng>—The woman was afraid (no wonder) at the girl speaking who had till then been dumb and at the thing she said, and she answered, ‘If this be thy first utterance it is time we moved!’ The woman and the rest of the family went into the <gai>‘cùltaigh,’<eng> backhouse, and made fast the door with the <gai>‘cnotag,’<eng> latch, and the <gai>‘pollag.’<eng> The corpse got down from the bier, tried the door of the <gai>‘cùltaigh,’<eng> and began to force it, calling out,

<gai>‘Ugad mi! ugad mi!
Agam co dhiùbh!’<eng>

‘I am coming at you! I am coming at you!
I’ve got you anyhow!’

As he could not force the door with the heavy stones behind it, he scraped and scratched away under the <gai>‘comhla,’<eng> and had a big hole made there when the <gai>‘coileach mór,’<eng> big cock, flapped his two wings and crowed. The corpse fell again dead on the floor, and was found there when the son came home.


A woman in Uist, a Roman Catholic, went to see a Protestant neighbour who was ailing. While they were together, the fowls on the rafters flew down to the floor and flew about as if pursued. There was no pursuit, however, and the woman, much amazed, looked at her sick friend for an explanation. The woman was dead.

A man in Uist was playing his pipes in the house during a great snow-storm. In the midst of the music the cock flew down from the spar and crowed loudly. The man kept on playing and the cock kept on crowing. The man’s wife said, ‘Stop, John, there is something wrong.’ Presently the priest came to tell John that his brother Malcolm had just perished, on account of the storm, in the lake near by.

CALUM CILLE AGUS AN LIABAG: <eng>COLUMBA AND THE FLOUNDER<gai>

BHA Calum Cille latha san tràigh shìolag agus shaltair e air Liabaig bhig bhòidhich bhàin agus dhochair e a h-earball. Dh’éibh an Liabag bheag bhrònach aird a cinn―

‘A Chaluim mhóir mhosaich,
Le d’ chasan croma crosgach,
’S mór a rinn thu dha m’ dhosgaidh
Dar a shaltair thu air m’earball.’

Ghabh Calum Cille fearg chionn na tilgeil air gun robh e croma-chasach agus thubhairt e―

BÀIRNEACH: <eng>LIMPET

WHEN the Limpet opens her breast to drink the sun (as the people say), birds and beasts come to prey on her and sometimes get caught and are drowned. A Limpet closed upon an Oyster-Catcher and pressed her imprisoned bill against the rock. The bird called out to her mate:

[TD 11]

<gai>‘’D é nì mi? ’d é nì mi? ’d é nì mi?
’Ille ghuib dheirg! ’ille ghuib dheirg!’

‘Cum rithe! cum rithe! cum rithe!
Gon till tìde mara na leirg.’<eng>

‘What shall I do? what shall I do? what shall I do?
Lad of the red bill! lad of the red bill!’

‘Hold on! hold on! hold on!
Till turns the tide of the sea.’

This unwise advice led to the drowning of the Oyster-Catcher. A Rat caught in the same way escaped, though maimed, because he bravely faced the difficulty. Gaelic lore is full of incitements to pluck and endurance.

<gai>‘Diort a nì mi? diort a nì mi?
Fhir a’ chòta dhuibh! fhir a’ chòta dhuibh!’

‘Spìon as i! spìon as i!
Tur! tur! tur!’<eng>

‘What shall I do? what shall I do?
Man of the black coat! man of the black coat!’

‘Tear it off! tear it off!
Completely! completely! completely!’

The Rat placed his three crooked claws in position, using the Limpet as a fulcrum, and he took his life with himself though he left his foot with the Limpet.

<gai>‘Is bàidheil bith ri beatha;
Thug mi liom mo bheatha,
Dh’fhàg mi mo spòg cheana
An greim geanail na bàirnich.’<eng>

‘Dear is living to life;
I took with me my life,
Howbeit I left my paw
In the hard grip of the Limpet.’

It will be observed that this was the black rat, indigenous to Britain, now nearly extinct. Only in Benbecula has the writer seen the black rat, and perhaps because of its rarity, perhaps because of its beauty, it never aroused in him the aversion which he has always felt towards the intrusive grey Hanoverian rat.

RÒIN

Is e daoine fo gheasaibh a tha sna ròin. Tha iad co colach ri daoine anns an aodann agus a tha dà sgadan r’a chéile. Tha an t-sùil agus sealladh na sùl colach ri sùil agus ri sealladh duine. Nar bheil teagamh nach e daoine fo gheasaibh a tha sna ròin.

Tha dà threubh ròn ann, treubh ròn beag agus treubh ròn mór, treubh nan sìochaire agus treubh nam fuamhaire. Nar bheil comann aig an dà threubh r’a chéile, nara bheil nas mutha na tha aig duine geal ri duine dubh. Agus a bharrachd air a sin, chan e an aon dùthaich is dachaidh daibh. Tha na ròin bheag a’ cumail ris na cumhaing agus ris na caolais agus ris na lochan mara ta dol a steach dh’an tìr. Uaidh seo theirear ròn caolais na ròn locha ris an ròn bheag, co math ri ròn sìochaire.

Cha tig an ròn mór dha na lochan mara na dha na caolais bheaga chumhang na dha na h-eileanan a staigh; cha tig idir. Tha e cumail ris ’na haaf agus ris na h-eileanan a muigh agus ri sgeirean agus ri òbanan a’ chuain mhóir.

Tha diubhair mhór ann an gnè agus ann an gnàth agus ann am meud an dà sheòrsa. Tha an ròn beag a’ breith a chuilein ma mheadhon an t-samhraidh; tha an cuilean glas ’ga bhreith agus tha calg goirid cruaidh air mar tha air a mhàthair. Tha an ròn mór a’ breith a chuilein ma leth a’ gheamhraidh; tha an cuilean geal anns an dath mar chaora gun rùsgadh agus le fionnadh fada mìn air. Tha an dath agus am fionnadh sin a’ fuireach ma dhà mhìos. Tha an cuilean a’ tilgeil an fhionnaidh sin agus tha calg dubhghorm agus dubhghlas agus dubh-liath a’ tighinn ’na àite. Is e moineis na bainis a theirear ri ròn boireann agus briomal ri ròn fireann.

Bhitheadh muinntir Uibhist a’ marbhadh agus ag itheadh nan ròn. Bha feòil nan ròn air a chunntadh fallan. Theirte ‘na briomail’ na ‘na briomalaich’ ri muinntir taobh siar Uibhist. Theirte ‘na bàghaich’ ri muinntir taobh sear Uibhist a thaobh agus gun robh iad a’ fuireach anns na bàigh.


<eng>Another informant, Angus Morrison, Suainebost, who was blind, told me (16th November 1887) that the <gai>‘ròn mór,’<eng> great seal, has its cub about 10th November, and the cub is cream-coloured. The male great seal is called <gai>‘cullach,’<eng> the female <gai>‘biast’<eng> or <gai>‘piast.’<eng> When the female is bringing forth, the male attends her most assiduously; she strikes him on the head and tries to drive him away, but without effect—he is exultant. The seals used to cub in Sùlasgeir, not in Rona, as this was inhabited.

Hoilisgeir is a rock, or rather reef, a mile and a half from land on the coast of South Uist. Within recent memory it summered three sheep, but now the winter waves sweep over the islet and it summers none. It has always been a resort of the great seals, which crowd on it like a flock of sheep. In pairing-time the males fight for the females as do the male deer. There fierce fights are seen and heard from land, the seals’ fierce roars resounding like those of wild bulls or lions at bay. In calm weather the seals of Hoilisgeir roar loudly, and when the people hear them they know that a storm is coming and prepare accordingly.

NIGHEAN RÌGH TÌR NAN TONN

BHA fear ann roimh seo ann an Aird an Runnair an Uibhist a Tuath ris an cainte Ruairidh Ruadh nan Ròn. Bha e oidhche a muigh a’ creagadh, agus chual e ceòl binn bòidheach nach cual a chluas riamh a leithid. Lean an duine an ceòl, agus dh’éisd e ris gu bog balbh, agus bha leis nach cual e riamh leithid a’ chiùil anns a’ cholann daonna. Chunn e an luchd ciùil gu soilleir, comhlan grinn gasda dannsadh agus fear dhiubh a’ cluich ciùil. Bha iad air an sgeadach gu h-innealta ann an sìoda na Gailbhinn agus ann an stròl na Frainge.

Chunn e sin thall ann an geòdha creige torr do rudan dubha agus dubhghlas, breac agus breacghlas, mar gum bitheadh seicheannan cruidh. ’D é bha seo ach biain nan ròn a chuir iad dhiubh aig an dannsadh.

Sheas an duine coimhead air a’ chluich a bh’ann agus gun fios aige fo’n Mhoire mhìn Mhàthair ciod e no cà ’n rachadh e.

Stad an ceòl. Leum Ruairidh a null agus chuir e bian fo chleòca mór agus sheas e feuch ’d é rithist. Rug gach ròn riamh air cochall, agus chuir iad umpa iad, agus leum iad a sìos dh’an mhuir muin air mhuin mar gum faicte clann sgoil a’ sgaoileadh a mach as an taigh sgoil, gun for aca do chàch a chéile. Sheas aon nighean—an nighean donn a b’àillidh air an do sheall sùil riamh san domhan mhór. Bha pearsa na rìoghainn deas dìreach dealbhach mar luachairean mòintich, a cneas co geal ri sneachd na h-aon oidhche air bharr nam beann, a falt donn dualach air dhreach buadhach na gréine, agus a dà shùil blàth mar dhà dhriùchd meala air bharra nan dos. Bha an duine saoilsinn aige féin nach fac e riamh anns a’ cholann daonna na ann an smaoin na h-oidhche boinne fala co àlainn ris an rìoghainn donn.

Bha i fàsgadh nan dorn agus a’ sileadh nan diar, a’ siubhal a sìos agus a suas, a null agus a nall, feuch am faiceadh i a trusgan, agus an trusgan air chall. Dé chan fhaca sealladh, agus an trusgan fo chòta mór an duine.

Chuir mais a’ bhoireannaich lasadh ’na chridhe agus truas ’na bhrollach, agus chaidh e null, agus a bhoineid ’na dhorn, agus dh’fheòraich e dhith ’d é bha ’ga dìth.

Chaidh rìoghainn donn na h-àilleachd dachaidh ceum air cheum le Ruairidh Ruadh. Chaidh e dh’an bhùthaidh agus cheannaich e deise dhi, agus chuir an nighean an deise uimpe. ‘Is mise,’ ars ise, ‘nighean Righ Tìr nan Tonn fo gheasaibh. Chaochail mo mhàthair agus thug m’athair dhachaidh té eile ’na h-àite. Thubhairt mo mhuime gun robh mi anns an rathad oirre, agus dh’iarr i air a’ chlach* ùlair mo thoir dh’an

Fhuaradh pears eaglais agus bhaisteadh agus phòsadh an rìoghainn gun an corr dàlach.

Rug i triùir mhac dreachar dealbhach do’n duine, ach bha nàdar nan ròn annta. An ceann àireamh bhliadhna thubhairt i, ‘Tha mise falbh, a Ruairidh. Thoir dhomh mo thrusgan, agus gun mi dh’fhàgail slàn le luchd mo ghaoil ’s mo ghràidh aig an dannsadh. Cha toir iad air falbh mi, agus am burn beannaichte air mo ghnùis agus air mo bhathais.

Similarly when hair was cut, at the waxing of the moon, the child from whom the hair was taken placed a lock of it in the hole of a wall as high as the hand could reach. After that the little owner of the lock was to grow with the growing moon until the little head reached as high as the little hand had reached before. The child went every now and then to measure the head against the hair in the wall. Those hopes! And those disappointments!

The <gai>‘luch fheòir,’<eng> field-mouse, was believed to exert a bad influence. A child who stepped across a field-mouse would stop growing and would remain a dwarf.

To place the sieve on a child’s head had the same effect; hence the sayings, applied as those above, <gai>‘Chuireadh an criathar air do cheann,’<eng> ‘The sieve was placed upon thine head.’ <gai>‘Is tu thug an leum criathair,’<eng> ‘It is thou who gavest the sieve-leap,’ a small leap in growing.

The litter she carefully hid under an upturned tub while she went forth to plead her poverty to our Divine Lord. He paid no heed to her false talk and her pressing importunities. At length she was obliged to desist and went back to her house. Her first care was to go and feed the pigs. She lifted the lid of the tub and what was her horror to see a litter of nasty vicious gnawing creatures of a kind she had never known before. They rushed forth gnawing and devouring and destroying and would have destroyed the produce of the whole world had not our Blessed Lord created the cat to check them.

FOGHNADH FEAMAINN

<eng>THE people of the Western Isles are greatly dependent upon seaweeds for the manuring of their lands.

Seaweed is detached by the action<gai>

<eng>The people have a simple, effective way of clearing the ground of large boulders. They kindle a good fire of their best peats on the top of the stone. When the stone is sufficiently heated they pour cold water on it, and the boulder breaks into manageable fragments. If they wish to split the stone in a particular direction, for lintels, corner-stones and the like, the extend the fire in that direction, along the natural cleavage if possible. The stone being heated and the fire swept aside, two parallel banks of plastic boulder-clay are hastily laid along the line of the fire. Into this improvised channel a continuous stream of cold water is prouded, when the rock splits, invariably along the required line.

Another method the old people had was to drill short holes at intervals along the given line, generally along the stratum. Into these holes they drove wedges of dry wood, and then left them to the rains. Under moisture the wedges expanded so much that their combined pressure along the whole line was enough to split stratified granite.

In their present depressed condition the people do not practise the old ingenuity of their fathers.

The scarcity of seaweed caused by a prolonged calm period is a serious matter; the people watch and hope and pray for the coming of seaweed, and are anxious at the prospect of impending famine. When the seaweed comes they rejoice and sing hymns of praise to the gracious God of the sea Who has heard their prayers.

IASGACH: <eng>FISHING

FROM the manner in which Christ spoke of fish the people look upon fish as semi-sacred. The fish was a symbol of Christ Himself. Besides this, the people cherish many curious beliefs and customs and have many sayings and stories about fish and fishing.

A mother in Barra sent her two boys to fish. They came home with nothing, saying:

<gai>‘Is corrach gob dubhain, a mhàthaireag.’<eng>

‘Narrow is a hook’s point, little mother.’

To this she promptly replied:

<gai>‘Masa corrach gob dubhain,
Is farsainn bial tàibh, a mhiceanan.’<eng>

‘If narrow a hook’s point,
Wide is the mouth of a spoon-net, little sons.’

This woman was the wife of a schoolmaster in Barra. She was a native of Stirling, where no Gaelic is spoken, but after a year in Barra she spoke Gaelic well, and after two years she spoke it excellently. She used to reproach the people of Barra for not cultivating their flexible expressive language.

In Barra a fisherman will not wear clothing in which crotal is used. Crotal clings to the rocks, and were a fisherman to fall into the sea the crotal in his clothing would cling to the rocks in the bottom of the sea and prevent his coming to the surface.

In Barra the fishermen used to set their lines on New Year’s Day. This gave them a claim for the season on the banks on which they set their lines. There the lines might remain, perhaps with only a few hooks attached, until St Bride’s Day or thereabouts, marked with a buoy, that other lines might not be shot there and become entangled. No one else made claim to a place thus marked, for <gai>‘ciad seilbh seilbh is fearr còir,’<eng> ‘first possession has the best right.’ When the fishing season came these first hooks were taken up. The first hook of the season is then put down in the name of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. (See also i. 173.)

When a man becomes a regular fisherman he is seized by his fellow boatmen and dipped in a convenient sea pool, to initiate him into the craft.

[TD 37]

<gai>A’ CHAILLEACH:<eng> THE HAG

IN those places where the crofters’ fields are generally of a size and near each other, there is great striving to finish the harvest in time and not to be the last to have the corn cut. It was supposed that he who finished last had to support an invisible hag, <gai>‘cailleach,’<eng> all the winter. It was the custom to bind up a handful of straw, the last sheaf of corn cut on the field, and to make it up into the likeness of a woman with docken and ragweed stalks, and tied with threads of various colours. This was called in Argyll, Perthshire, Uist, and other places the <gai>‘cailleach.’<eng> When a man finished cutting his corn he sent the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> to a man who had not finished. This was considered a great insult to the recipients and was deeply resented, sometimes to the shedding of blood.

Caution had to be used in conveying the sheaf; usually a young man mounted on a horse passed the neighbour’s uncut field at full gallop as if on urgent business, and threw the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> into the field on his course.

A man went on horseback in this fashion from Bornish to Milton in South Uist. After placing the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> he started to return. Two men on horseback set out after him, overtook him, and brought him back to Milton. They shaved his beard and hair and made <gai>‘bearradh eòin is amadain air,’<eng> a clipping of bird* and of fool on him, and sent him home.

<gai>‘Dùghall an Droma,’<eng> Dugall of the Ridge, sent the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> to ‘Pàdra’ Nicolson, Cnoc na Mòine, Benbecula. The messenger was caught, clipped, stripped, and sent home naked.

Other instances of violence done in consequence of sending the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> might be given. A crofter or tacksman would sooner see his best cow dead than see the <gai>‘cailleach’<eng> on his <gai>‘iomair buana,’<eng> harvest rig.

In Harris, Skye, and Glen Elg the last sheaf of the harvest is called the <gai>‘gobhar bhacach,’<eng> halting goat. Dire evil and misfortune are predicted for the man on whom it falls―

<gai>Thig earchall is mearchall is gearchall
Air cearban na gobhair bhacaich.<eng>

Cattle-loss, death-loss, and mischance
Will befall the luckless one of the ‘gobhar bhacach.’


* The phrase was originally <gai>‘bearradh geòin (geòine),’<eng> ‘fool’s tonsure, clipping in mockery.’

[TD 38]

<gai>
AN ÀIRIGH

<eng>LEWIS is the only place in Scotland, probably the only place in Britain, where the people still go to the <gai>‘àirigh,’<eng> moorland shieling or mountain pasturage. Throughout Lewis the crofters of the townland go to the shieling on the same date each year, and they return from it on the same date each year. The sheep and cattle know their day as well as do the men and women, and on that day the scene is striking and touching—all the <gai>‘nì,’<eng> flocks, are astir and restless to be off, requiring all the care of the people to restrain them and keep them together and in proper order. Should any event, such as a death and burial, cause the people to postpone the migration, the flocks have to be guarded day and night, or they would be off to their summer pastures by themselves.

Most of the shielings are several miles, some six or eight, some twelve or fourteen miles, from the townland homes. The moorlands are rough and rugged and full of swamps and channels, and the people use much care in guiding the cattle, especially the young ones not yet experienced in travelling. Even these, however, soon learn, being ‘gey gleg in the uptak,’ very quick of apprehension. It is instructive to see the caution with which the older animals travel over the rough channeled moors, daintily feeling their way when not sure of their ground. When they reach their camping ground the cattle and sheep soon spread themselves over the heather, being tired and hungry. While being milked the cattle eat the fodder which the girls and women have brought in creels.

This fodder is not so much grass as vegetables of various kinds, some of them of the most unpromising quality, such as nettles, dockens, ragworts, chickweed, common rushes and bulrushes. These the Lewis cattle eat with relish as a change from the heather and tussock-grass of the moorland. But it is still more curious to see them greedily eating fish-bones, especially the spinal bones of the cod and ling. There is nothing that a Lewis cow so much enjoys—not the most succulent clover nor the greenest corn in the blade. It is a common thing to find the side of a house partly or wholly covered with fish-bones, drying in the summer sun and becoming impregnated with the peat-reek which streams through the straw thatch. The bones are sometimes given to the cattle entire, but generally they are first more or less crushed between stones. Even so, it is difficult to conceive how the sharp spines fail to tear and injure the mouths, throats and stomachs of the cows. The people, however, say that no injury results; on the contrary, the fish-bones are a valuable food, and on a cold day nothing can be more wholesome. When a cow comes in wet, cold and shivering, a

[TD 39]

THE SHIELING

fish-bone is given her to chew. This chewing tries her to the utmost, and soon upon the point of every hair of her body stands a bead of perspiration, while from her rises a cloud of steam. The people are keen observers, and they follow the teaching of their forefathers, who studied nature with observant eyes and with intelligent interest.

The island of Berneray in Loch Roag is cut off by a deep channel some hundreds of yards wide, through which the tide runs rapidly and strongly. Over this channel the people of the island swim their cattle, at high or low tide in order to avoid the worst currents. The calves are generally carried across in boats; but the calves are in a hurry to follow their mothers, and the mothers are in a hurry to be over the sound and on the moorland, and despite all precautions they dash into the sea and are out in the current, the calves rushing after them and struggling bravely with this new element. The masterful strength of the tide gives full scope to the strong experienced cow, but the weak, inexperienced calf is swept away like a leaf. Now is the time for the men in the boats—they pursue the calves over the stream and either draw them into the boats or lead them to land. Calves and cows having reached the shore safely, they shake the water from their shaggy backs, rush up the rocky beach, and are off to the moorland and their own pastures. It is worth going far to witness this exciting scene.

The shieling time is the most delightful time of the rural year, the time of the healthy heather bed and the healthy outdoor life, of the moorland breeze and the warm sun, of the curds and the cream of the heather milk. The young men come out from the townland in twos and threes and half-dozens to spend the night among the maidens of the shieling; some of them play the pipes or some other instrument, and the song and the dance and the merriment begin and are continued all night long under the moon on the green grass before the shieling door. I have heard old men and women waxing eloquent over these lightsome days and nights of their youth, and again sobbing and sighing over awakened memories too tender for words.

While the flocks are away at the moorland pastures the home pastures have grown rich and green, and on reaching home after a weary march and long fasting the cattle, like children, have to be restrained from eating too much. This good feeding produces good milking, and there is food for man and beast all autumn and winter through, and joy in house and byre.

SAODACH A’ CHRUIDH

<eng>THE man or woman, youth or maiden, who goes <gai>‘a’ saodach (saodachadh) a’ chruidh,’<eng> driving the cows, to the morning pastures, sings a song to the flock as they move leisurely along. The melody is very pleasing to man and evidently to beast. The song commends the cattle to the keeping of Mary the mild, to the keeping of Brigit the fair, and to the keeping of Michael<gai>

<eng>The person who goes to bring the cattle home probably meets them coming on their way. When they come in sight, the man or woman, youth or maiden, addresses them in a rich variety of endearing terms, and as he draws nearer he strikes up a song of welcome to the cattle, <gai>‘fàilte a’ chruidh,’<eng> to which they respond with a low modulated moan, sometimes breaking forth into a bellow. Some cow has hustled her way to the front, and the rest follow her as a leader. The bull always brings up the rear.

Occasionally a young animal during the day separates himself from the herd and remains, after they have gone homeward, grazing in some

the valiant, whose sword is sharp but whose shield is strong. The song is sung in slow measured cadences charming to hear; and it is interesting to see the measured tread of the older cattle keeping time with the well-known music.

hidden hollow, oblivious of the approach of night. The herdsman, fearing that the truant may have been caught in a bog or fallen over a rock, searches high and low, near and far. At last coming in sight of him, he addresses him in terms and tones different from those he used to the others. The animal stops grazing and looks up—it is only for a moment: he is off at his hardest, taking the nearest way for home, over a lakelet, across a river, over whatever obstacle may lie in his path. <gai>‘Tuigidh an cù a choire féin.’<eng>—‘The dog understands his own fault.’

<eng>DOWN to the middle of the nineteenth century it was customary in the Island of Lismore to give a special breakfast to all animals upon the farm on Christmas morning. Cattle and horses got a sheaf of corn in the stall, sheep got sheaves of corn spread out for them on the field, while pigs and poultry got special feeding of an appropriate sort. Even the birds of the air received a special feast. When a tree was at hand a sheaf of

<eng>THE <gai>‘crannachan,’<eng> a kind of churn, is a cylindrical vessel of staves. Its lid is detachable and has a hole in the centre with a cuplike lip. Through this hole passes a staff or plunger with a perforated disc fixed to its lower end. The plunger is called <gai>‘loinid,’ ‘simid,’ ‘ceann-simid,’ ‘maide maistridh.’<eng> The cuplike lip of the hole is designed to intercept any cream that may come up with the plunger in the process of churning.

The <gai>‘crannachan’<eng> supplanted churns of other types. One of these was the <gai>‘cuinneag,’<eng> stoup. This too was circular and built of staves, but it was much wider at the base than at the top. It had no plunger. The cream having been put in, the mouth of the vessel was covered with the dressed skin of lamb, sheep, kid, goat, or calf, and tightly bound with a cord of linen or leather. This covering was called <gai>‘bùilig,’ ‘bùilich,’ ‘bùileach.’<eng> The <gai>‘cuinneag,’<eng> thus secured, was placed on a bench, bed, table or other suitable place, and the process of churning consisted in agitating it rapidly to and fro.

The <gai>‘crannachan,’<eng> staff-churn, was felt to be an innovation.<gai>

LUATHADH

<eng>FIVE minor processes are involved in waulking. There is first the process of thickening the cloth; second the process of cleansing the cloth; third, the process of folding it; fourth, the process of giving it tension; and after these the rite of consecrating the cloth. All these processes are performed with care of eye and deftness of hand come of ability and experience.

During the work the women sing lively, stirring, emphatic songs. One sings a verse, all join in the chorus. The leader usually sits at the head of the waulking-frame; if she is advanced in life she is not allowed to work, in which case she sits a few feet back and in a line with the frame. The women keep time with their arms or feet.

Most of the songs sung are war-songs, love-songs, boating-songs, and hunting-songs. In all these the lovers or husbands or chiefs of the women form the subject of the song, which is fervid and personal to a degree. There are also perhaps impromptus, on some local topic, perhaps on the real or supposed love-affairs of one or more of the girls present. Perhaps the hunter who has looked in with his dog and his gun in passing, or the traveller with his staff and his plaid who has come to see and to listen, may form the subject of an impromptu song to a well-known air. In this case the women politely endow the subject of the song with many merits and good qualities, both mental and physical, which he, modest man, never knew he possessed.

When the process of waulking is completed the cloth is cleansed and washed with plenty of soap in a burn or stream if one is convenient. The cloth is carried to and from the water on a hand-barrow. After it is washed it is placed in folds, forming about a square of the cloth, and piled over one another. This process is called <gai>‘coinnleachadh,’ ‘cur chlò air choinnlean.’<eng> From these folds the cloth is rolled upon a piece of wood, round or flat as may be most conveniently got. This process is called <gai>‘cornadh,’ ‘cornadh a’ chlò,’ ‘cornadh an aodaich,’ ‘cur a’ chlò air chorn,’ ‘cornaich an clò.’<eng> The cloth is rolled slowly and carefully, bit by bit, hard and firm as the strong arms of the women can make it, in order that the tension may be evenly distributed. When the <gai>‘cornadh’<eng> is completed and the end secured, the web of cloth is laid across the waulking frame. The ceremony of consecration is now performed, the first part solemnly, the second jubilantly. There are three celebrants, the oldest of them leading, the others following according to age. The first celebrant seizes the cloth and moves round about half a turn. Freeing her hands, she seizes it again and brings it round to complete the turn. With the first move the woman says, <gai>‘Cuirim car deiseal,’<eng> ‘I give a turn sunwise’; and with the second move, completing the circle, she completes the sentence, <gai>‘am freasdal an Athar,’<eng> ‘dependent on the Father.’ The other two women turn the web similarly in name of Son and in name of Spirit.

[TD 89]

WAULKING*

<gai>‘Làn luathadh,’<eng> a full waulking, was an elaborate and beautiful operation. It was complicated and required experience and knowledge, and on this account one or two or three women specialists were appointed to conduct it. There was a <gai>‘bean luathaidh,’<eng> waulking woman, to lead the waulking. There was a <gai>‘bean dhuan,’<eng> woman of songs or lilts, to lead the singing; and there was a <gai>‘bean dhlighe,’<eng> woman of ceremony, to lead the processes in their order. The best workers and the best singers were chosen for the purpose, special stress being laid upon ceremony and upon music.

In the island of Coll there was a race of women called <gai>‘Clann Pheidirein,’<eng> descendants of Peter, Patersons, who were famous through the generations for their knowledge of the formalities and the technicalities and the melodies of the waulking. Before the people were evicted one or more of these women presided over every waulking in the island. The last of the family was Janet Paterson, Greòsabal, aged eighty-two. She had all the processes of the waulking as no one else had, and carried them out as no one else could. These Mac Pheidirein women had a wonderful fascination over the workers and the singers at the waulking.

<gai>‘Chan fhaodar an t-aon òran a sheinn dà uair aig an aon luadh. Ma sheinnear, thig a’ mhàthair chlò agus fàgaidh i an t-aodach stiallach tana agus mar a bha e an toiseach.’<eng>—‘The same song may not be sung twice at the same waulking. If the same song be sung twice, the cloth-mother will come and render the cloth as thin and streaky as it was before.’ At the waulking in the island of Miu’alaidh, Mingulay, near Barra, in 1866, I asked a beautiful girl to sing a certain song over again. She blushed and looked confused and abashed, and the women looked in an embarrassed way at one another. The leader said that were they to sing the same song twice at the same waulking the cloth would become thin and streaky and white as <gai>‘rùsg na caora,’<eng> the sheep’s fleece, and there was no knowing what mischief might not befall the wearer of the cloth or the singer of the song. The hands of these girls were small, the fingers tapered, the arms muscular, the girls themselves of medium height, strongly made, well formed, muscular, and well mannered.

<gai>‘Casadh’<eng> means hair or pile. <gai>‘Casadh,’ ‘basadh’<eng> and <gai>‘basradh’<eng> all refer to the same operation, the process of raising a pile on the cloth. <gai>‘Thathar a’ tutanadh an aodaich a null agus a’ tatanaich an aodaich a nall bho thaobh gu taobh agus bho cheann gu ceann na cléithe, agus ’ga bhasradh le basaibh nam boireannach.’<eng>—‘The cloth is dragged hither and the cloth is drawn thither from side to side and from end to end of the frame or hurdle, and a pile raised on it with the women’s palms.’

<eng>MARTIN reports that the men and women of St Kilda had a genius for poetry, music and dancing, to all of which they were addicted. Dr Johnson, on the other hand, declared that no good poetry could come from St Kilda. The technique and diction of the following pieces would not satisfy Johnson, but they have other qualities that might please him. Though not old, they have a charming simplicity and intense feeling. They are some of several* which the writer took down on 22nd May 1865 from the recitation of Eibhrig Nic Cruimein, Euphemia MacCrimmon, cottar, aged eighty-four years, who had many old songs, stories, and traditions of the island. I would have got more of these had there been peace and quiet to take them down, but this was not to be had among a crowd of naval officers and seamen and St Kilda men, women and children, and, even noisier than these, St Kilda dogs, mad with excitement and all barking at once. The aged reciter was much censured for her recital of these songs and poems, and the writer for causing the old woman to stir the recesses of her memory for this lore; for the people of St Kilda have now discarded songs and music, dancing, folklore, and the stories of the foolish past.† We were silenced, but not subdued, and I fear that one of us was

‘Even in his penance
Planning sins anew.’

Euphemia MacCrimmon said that the <gai>‘comhradh,’<eng> conversation, was composed by her own father and mother before they were married.‡

It was seldom that a St Kilda man died a natural death. When a St Kildan was asked, <gai>‘Ciod e am bàs a fhuair t’athair?’,<eng> ‘What death did your father get?’, the answer would too often be, <gai>‘Chaidh e leis,’<eng> ‘He went over (the rock)’; sometimes <gai>‘Chaidh a bhàthadh,’<eng> ‘He was drowned’; infrequently <gai>‘Fhuair e bàs cinn-adhairt,’<eng> ‘He got a pillow-death, died in his bed.’ Euphemia MacCrimmon’s own father and her mother’s father were on the rock <gai>‘ag ianach,’<eng> hunting birds. The younger man was on a ledge below, seizing the birds, and the elder man on a ledge above,


* Others have been published already.

† St Kilda is now (1940) without permanent human inhabitants.

‡ An earlier manuscript of the Collector’s contains the second and third sections of this song (i.e. those beginning ‘Buidheachas’ and ‘Nàile’), and also this note: This is all I have been able to get of the song; I wish much I could get the whole, but I have no idea where to find it. The old man Ruairidh Domhnallach [Roderick MacDonald], aged eighty-five, in Clachan a’ Ghluib, North Uist, from whom I got these verses, heard the song many years ago from a servant girl he had from St Kilda. I would walk forty miles to procure the rest of the song. I doubt not but the gannets are meant by the phrase <gai>‘na h-eòin mhóra.’<eng>

ST KILDA LILT

holding the rope. The fulcrum against which the latter held his feet suddenly broke away from the parent rock, precipitating the two helpless men into the seething Atlantic. Their bodies, when recovered, were much mangled, though the birds under their girdles had kept them afloat. These accidents caused much misery to the little community. Their distress was often rendered the more bitter that the wild sea around their rocky island often made it impossible to recover the dead, though the bodies could be seen buoyed up by the birds secured to them. The people are now either more cautious than their fathers were, or better provided, for accidents are fewer.

On one occasion eighteen men came from St Kilda to Uist for corn seeds for their crofts, their own scant crops having been destroyed by the storms of the previous autumn. They were taken to Balranald, one of the best and biggest and best known farms in the Western Isles, and there they got all they wanted. They then started out on their long and perilous homeward voyage, which, alas, they never made, their frail coracle being swallowed up in the wild waves of the stormy Atlantic.

The St Kilda men’s visit was long remembered, for it caused much amusement at the time; the artless simplicity, the peculiar words, and the lisping accent of the men were talked of long afterwards, but always kindly. If a question were asked of one of them, all the eighteen men would reply simultaneously, with one voice and one accord. Mrs MacDonald of Balranald asked, <gai>‘Am bi pòsadh agus baisteadh agaibh ann an Tiort?’ ‘O ghà’ag (ghràdhag) ghaolach, cha bhi, cha bhi pòsadh no baisteadh againn, is ann a tha sinn a chon a dhol a dhìth. Cia mar a phòsas no a bhaisteas sinn, nach d’eug a’ bhramach-innilt? agus chan urra dhuinn clann a bhith againn, agus is ann a tha sinn, a ghà’ag, an annar a dhol a dhìth.’ ‘Ciod e an rud a tha anns a’ bhramach-innilt?’ ‘Tha, a ghà’ag, am boireannach a tha am bun na bratha (mnatha) a tha cur na cloinne chon an t-saoghail.’<eng>—‘Do you have marriages and baptisms in St Kilda?’ ‘Oh my dear beloved, no, we have no marriages or baptisms, rather we are dying out. How shall we marry and baptize, did not the “bramach-innilt” die? and we cannot have children, and we are, my dear, like to die out.’ ‘What is the “bramach-innilt”?’ ‘It is, my dear, the female who attends to the woman who is sending children into the world.’

<gai>‘Bramach-innilt,’<eng> midwife, bondswoman, handmaiden, is the regular word in St Kilda for what others usually call <gai>‘bean-ghlùin.’<eng> Ordinarily the <gai>‘bean-shiùla’<eng> goes upon one knee, only in the remote island of Heisgeir the <gai>‘bean tuisil’ (‘tuisilidh’)<eng> goes upon both knees.

SILVERWEED

The root was much used throughout the Highlands and Islands before the potato was introduced. It was cultivated, and so grew to a considerable size. As certain places are noted for the cultivation of the potato, so certain places are remembered for the cultivation of silverweed. One of these was Lag nan Tanchasg in Paible, North Uist, where a man could sustain himself on a square of ground of his own length. In dividing <gai>‘mór-fhearann,’<eng> common ground, the people lotted their land for <gai>‘brisgein’<eng> much as they lotted their fishing-banks at sea and their fish on shore. The poorer people exchanged <gai>‘brisgein’<eng> with the richer for corn and meal, quantity for quantity and quality for quality. The <gai>‘brisgein’<eng> was sometimes boiled in pots, sometimes roasted on stoves, and sometimes dried and ground into meal for bread and porridge. It was considered palatable and nutritious.<gai>

AM MÒTHAN

<eng>THE <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> or <gai>‘mòlus,’<eng> pearlwort,* is rare, and is found in the moorland and the hill. It has five- or six-pointed leaves and red roots.

It is a <gai>‘lus beannaichte,’<eng> blessed plant, according to some, because it was the first plant on which Christ placed His foot when He came to earth; according to others, because it was the first plant on which he placed His foot after He rose from the dead; and a third reason given is that He lay on it when He was out and away from His enemies.

It was used, and is still to some extent used, for purposes varying according to the district or island. If placed over the <gai>‘arddoras,’<eng> lintel of the door, it prevents the <gai>‘sluagh,’<eng> airy host, from entering the house and from beguiling and spiriting away any of the household. When placed under the right knee of a woman in labour it has a soothing spiritual effect on the woman, ensures her relief, and secures to her and her child immunity from being spirited away by the fairies. When the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> is so used, <gai>‘dh’fheumte am fàinne pòsaidh agus a chuile fàinne eile a thoir bharr làimh a’ bhoireannaich air an leaba-làir’<eng>—the marriage ring and every other ring must be removed from the hand of the woman on the floor-bed, in order that the influence of the plant may not be checked or diverted.

It is used in many districts for a love-philtre. If a girl be kissed by her lover while even a small piece of the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> is in her mouth, the lover is ever after her adoring slave. Love-sick maidens wet their lips or drink the juice of the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> to entice the loved one. In this case the plant is placed in <gai>‘uisge sèimh,’<eng> still or silent water, and the juice pressed out of it and then drunk. The person who draws the water must observe silence from the time of setting out to the time of returning from the well, whence the name <gai>‘uisge sèimh.’<eng> It is drawn from a sacred well. In Ardchattan this was <gai>‘Tobar Bhaodain,’<eng> St Baodan’s Well, close to <gai>‘Teampall Bhaodain,’<eng> St Baodan’s church, behind the ancient Priory. In Nigg, near the town of Aberdeen, the holy well was <gai>‘Tobar Mhoire,’<eng> Mary’s Well, usually called the Lady’s Well. Still or silent water for healing and enticing was taken from this well in recent years and may perhaps still be taken.

A small bag containing the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> and an iron nail is put under the milk boyne; the virtue of the plant joined to that of the iron avails much. When placed in the fore hooves of the bull when with the cow, the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> sains the cow’s milk from having its <gai>‘toradh,’<eng> substance, spirited away, and her calf from <gai>‘dosgaidh is altradh,’<eng> mischance and mishap. A cow that ate the pearlwort is sained, and no evil influence can affect her or the calf she carries or the milk she gives or the man, woman or child that drinks the milk.

<gai>Chaidh dìst bhan dh’an chuithe a thoir air falbh an toraidh. Ghabh té dhiubh null gu bó mhór liamhaidh dhonn taobh an tolmain an oir na cuithe, a’ cnàmh a cìre agus a’ cnuasach a cuid, ach có, a ghràidhein, a b’urrainn innseadh ’d é air an robh i a’ smuaineachadh? Thug a bana-chompanach an aire dh’an bhoireannach agus dh’eubh i dhi, ‘Faodaidh tu tilleadh, a mhuinneag, dh’ith a’ bhó mhór liamhaidh dhonn am mòthan air an t-sliabh.’ Thill am boireannach air a’ chas-cheum agus ghabh i suas gu bó mhór dhrimionn dhubh air cnocan cruinn am bràigh na buaile, a’ cnàmh a cìre, ag òl na gile agus a’ deoghal na feòchain.<eng>—Two women went to the fold to spirit away the substance (of the milk). One of them went towards a big spreading brown cow beside the hillock on the edge of the fold, chewing her cud and ruminating, but who, my dear, could tell of what she was thinking in her mind? The woman’s companion observed her and called to her. ‘Thou needs not, dame, go near the big spreading cow, she has eaten the pearlwort on the moor.’ The woman turned on her tracks and approached a big black white-backed cow on a round hillock in the upper part of the fold, chewing her cud, drinking the moon and sucking the breeze.—The ill women then did their will with this cow and all the others save the cow that ate the pearlwort, and not an atom of substance did they leave!—Oh, not an atom of substance did the ill women leave!

My dear old informant told me this in good faith, and expressed satisfaction that the women’s evil design had been in one case thwarted. I suggested <gai>‘gun robh an dà bhaidhbh a’ dol a dhèanamh saobh bhleoghain,’<eng> that the two wicked women were going to do the false milking. She acknowledged that that might be so, but maintained that in any case the <gai>‘mòthan’<eng> was a blessed plant full of charms and virtues to man and beast, and that it had been blessed by Christ Son of the Mary Mother and by Bride the Fostermother and by Calum Cille the best beloved of men and the most potent of saints. The narrator and the writer fell into a general discussion about the power of saints, the wickedness of the false milking, the evil spiriting away of substance, and the efficacy of the pearlwort. Of all these the aged reciter told many stories with the realism, vividness and conviction of all her kind. It is impossible to realise, without having experienced it, the charm, the power, the fascination of these old-world narrators over an audience. They were able men and women, with a courtesy and a politeness of manner all their own, and full of old-world ways and learning. May peace and blessing be with them for ever!

The <gai>‘saobh bhleoghan,’<eng> false milking, mentioned above was a kind of theft severely punished, first by being buried alive, upstanding, in the gateway of the fold, so that the cows going in and out might trample over the woman’s body in contempt; this was modified to the taking off of the right arm from the shoulder, then from the elbow, then from the wrist. In the island of Vallay, North Uist, is a small deep hollow in the ground caused by the sinking of the ground as the body of the upright victim decayed and fell to the bottom of the cylindrical grave.

A’ CHIAD DI-LUAIN ’AN RÀITHE

‘A’ CHIAD Di-Luain ’an ràithe bha an teaghlach air an cois much mocharach. Bheannaicheadh dh’an teaghlach le burn a fhuaradh o mhnaoi ghlic, no le burn a fhuaradh o mhnaoi aig an robh strian an eich uisge. Bha an latha sin ’na latha sonraichte gu casgadh beum sùla, agus gu tarrainn leannan r’a chéile, agus, mo chreach! gu dealachadh.’<eng>—On the first Monday of the quarter the household was early astir. They were blessed with water got from a wise woman, or with water got from a woman who had the bridle of the water-horse. That day was a specially good day for checking evil eye, and for drawing lovers to one another, and, alas! for parting.

The first Monday of the quarter was a favourite day for the men and women of the evil eye to practise their <gai>‘dubh-cheilg,’<eng> black guile, black art. This was the day on which the men and women of the <gai>‘frìth,’<eng> augury, cast their visions, and the men and women of the witchcraft spirited away the milk from the cows. It was unsafe to lend on this day, lest the luck of the house should go with the thing lent and never come back.

Some men observed this advice so closely that they kept their cattle indoors all day, letting them out for water only at nightfall, lest an evil eye should see them.

Cha luaithe thug an duine a chùl ris an taigh agus ris a’ bhaile na thuit an làir taobh a’ ghearrain anns a’ chrann, ion marbh air an raon. Shìn i uaip a ceann agus a casan anns a’ chlais.

<eng>THE incantation of the threads was made to a sick animal, generally a cattle-beast. The threads were in the form of a cord of three ply and of three colours. The number was symbolic of the Trinity. The colours used were black, symbolic of the condemnation of God; red, symbolic of the crucifixion of Christ; and white, symbolic of the purification of the Spirit.

The cord was applied thrice around the tail of the animal affected and tied in a threefold loop of ingenious construction, resembling the device of the trefoil in masonry. With the first turn the operator spat upon the cord in the name of God the Father, with the second in the name of Christ, with the third in the name of the Spirit.


In February 1906 a man from Benbecula came to the island of Grimisey, North Uist, to buy a horse. Passing a crofter’s house he saw a beautiful horse, praised it, and went on. He was hardly out of sight when the horse became ill, rolling on the ground in evident agony. Knowing that the stranger was reputed to have the evil eye, the owner of the horse hurried to a woman credited with power to counteract the evil. The woman twined with her teeth three threads of three ply and of different colours, and bade him tie these, one after the other, round the root of the horse’s tail in name of Father, in name of Son, in name of Spirit, Triune of power. The man did so, and he had barely completed his work when the horse rose, shook himself; and began to browse.

The woman said that she inherited the power from her father, a good man of few words and of many prayers. She said that she knew immediately on beginning her prayer whether the illness was due to natural causes or to the evil eye. In the former event, she prescribed natural cures; in the latter, she countered it through prayer. The evil eye of a man was more difficult to counteract than that of a woman, being, though less venomous, more powerful.

She declared that when she emerged from the struggle of counteracting the evil eye, she was mentally exhausted and had to rest for some days. She added that she felt sure that, were she to cease communing with God, He would immediately withdraw His gift and His countenance from her.

The writer knew the woman well, and can testify that she was a highly excellent woman, beloved and respected throughout a wide district.

THE CHARM OF THE THREADS

THE following lines were copied by the Rev. Archibald MacDonald, of Kiltarlity, from the Records of the Presbytery of Kintyre and Islay, dated at Kilvorow in Arran, 11th November 1697.

‘Milcolm MacIlvoil [Malcolm Macmillan] being called compeired and confessed he practised a charm (with a stringe and some words he spoke within the compasse of the stringe) for the rickets, possession, and any other sudden distemper, which he did practice by putting a lint thread to his breath and repeating the following words within the compasse of it, viz., <gai>Cuirim cumorich Dhia umid sluadh dall harrid do dhion vo gach gabhidh soisgeul Dhia na grais o mullach gu lar umid. Ga ghraichidh na fir hu 7 na millidh na mnaih thu.’*<eng> The lines may be rendered as follows:—

<gai>Cuirim comraich Dhé umad,
Sluagh dall tharad;
Do dhìon bho gach gàbhadh;
Soisgeul Dhé nan gràs
O mhullach gu làr umad.
Gun gràdhaicheadh na fir thu
Agus na milleadh na mnà thu.<eng>

I place the protection of God about thee,
Blind folk over thee (?);
Mayest thou be shielded from every peril;
May the Gospel of the God of grace
Be from thy crown to the ground about thee.
May men love thee
And women not work thee harm.

When cattle are sent to pasture or brought from pasture the person in charge of them leaves one or two animals behind to follow. This wards off the evil eye, the stock not being complete before the herdsman.

When a person praises an animal the man in charge of it promptly praises it more warmly. Were a stranger to say, <gai>‘Is briagh a’ bhó liamhach dhonn an toiseach na tàn,’<eng> ‘Beautiful is the broad brown cow that is leading the herd,’ the herdsman would reply, <gai>‘A Mhoire Mhàthair, ’s i tha briagh! Nar bheil bó air tàn san dùthaich co briagh rithe!’<eng> ‘Mary Mother, she is beautiful indeed! There is not a cow in any herd in the country so beautiful as she!’

THUBHAIRT am beulaiche: Bha Ìosa agus a Mhàthair a’ siubhal slighe, agus anns an dol seachad chaidh iad a steach do thaigh a leigeil dhiubh an sgìth.

Ach thubhairt a Mhàthair ri Crìosd, ‘Cuir féin, a Mhic, a dhìth a’ ghrìd anns a’ chìch.

BRISGEIN: <eng>THYROID GLAND

A GLAND in the throat of human beings and animals is called in Gaelic <gai>‘brisgein,’<eng> in English the thyroid gland. It is sometimes imperfect in a child from birth, in which case the child is dwarfed in mind and body. To remedy this the people applied the <gai>‘brisgein,’<eng> thyroid gland, of a sheep in the form of extract. A sheep born on <gai>‘Là Fhéill Brighde,’<eng> St Brigit’s Day, called <gai>‘caora Bhrighde’<eng> or <gai>‘caora Bhrighde mhìn,’<eng> the sheep of Brigit or the sheep of mild Brigit, was much sought for this purpose, but still more sought was a lamb born on this day, called <gai>‘uan Brighde’<eng> or <gai>‘uan Brighde nan nì agus nam beannachd,’<eng> the lamb of Brigit or the lamb of Brigit of the flocks and of the blessings. On the removal of the <gai>‘brisgein’<eng> the sheep or lamb was sacrificed to Brigit.

Not the least curious thing about the old Gaelic remedies is that many of them have been adopted in medical practice. Dr Donald Munro Morrison, the youngest son of the famous poet and blacksmith of Harris, <gai>‘Iain Gobha na Hearadh,’<eng> inherited his father’s marvellous talent in mechanics and was also a distinguished student of chemistry; he remarked that the Highlanders had cures for all the common ailments of man and beast, but where or how they had acquired them he could not understand; he had analysed the plants, earths and other remedies they used, and in no instance were these misapplied, on the contrary their ingredients were those now used by practitioners in a more concentrated form.


<gai>A’ BHUIDHEACH:<eng> JAUNDICE

A CURE for jaundice practised in the Outer Isles was to place a lump of salt butter on the stomach of the sick man. The butter was held in place by bandages passing round the man’s body, so fixed on all sides that none of the melting butter could flow away. After some hours the invalid was attacked by <gai>‘gairiseann,’<eng> nausea, which continued until the butter was absorbed into the tissues. The jaundice then disappeared, and the patient became strong and healthy.


<gai>BUIRBEAN:<eng> CANCER

From Thomas Ross, <gai>‘Inbhir Charsla,’<eng> Inver Casslie, Sutherland, aged 96. 15th November 1905

A MAN at Ullapool was famous for curing the <gai>‘buirbean,’<eng> cancer, <gai>‘silteach,’<eng>

[TD 201]

flow, and <gai>‘tinneas an rìgh,’<eng> king’s evil. He cured many men and women of these diseases.

We were living at <gai>‘Drochaid Sguideil,’<eng> Conon Bridge. A cancer came in my sister’s lip. Her lip was swelling and ever swelling, and the doctor said it was a bad case of cancer. My mother saw a man passing and went out and spoke to him. He came in and bathed his hands in a basin of clean cold water, and then bathed my sister’s lip with this water. He told my mother to put the water in a bottle and to bathe my sister’s lip with it at sunrise. My mother did as the man directed, and in three days the cancerous swelling disappeared, and never reappeared although my sister lived to old age. Everyone was surprised, and the doctor who said it was cancer was surprised. I do not remember the name of the man, and I never saw him before nor after, but I heard of him. My sister was Hanna Ross.

<gai>Bhathar a’ cur fuar-lit de iteodha ri cnoidh buirbein. Bha am plàsd iteodha co teith agus co treas gun robh e a’ spìonadh a’ bhuirbein a bun, na friamhaichean a’ tighinn leis a’ bhuirbein mar na friamhaichean a’ tighinn leis a’ mhungach-mhear féin as an talamh.<eng>—A cold poultice of hemlock was applied to a cancer sore. The hemlock plaster was so hot and so strong that it drew the cancer out from the bottom, the roots coming with the cancer as the roots come with the hemlock itself out of the ground.

This was effective when done in time. When the disease became soft nothing could cure it.

A police inspector in Glasgow had cancer in the lower lip. Instead of having it cut he went to his native home near Fort William. There a man applied a poultice of hemlock to the lip and extracted the cancer bodily. The patient told my informant that the pain was excruciating. The flesh containing the cancer came away, carrying the roots with it. These were very numerous and resembled the fine thready roots of hemlock; he could hear the sound of their breaking away. The patient placed the cancer in spirits and kept it for many years. My informant said that except for a hollow the man’s lip seemed quite healthy and normal.

A man who had cancer in the lip or a woman who had cancer in the breast went to a rock on a hot sunny day. There he or she exposed the part affected to

<gai>Na naodh gatha gréine,

<gai>CAOTHACH (CUTHACH), MEARAN, BOILE:<eng> MADNESS

THERE were various cures for madness, some of them rough. On <gai>‘Di-Daorn là Chaluim Chille,’<eng> Thursday the day of Columba, a strong man was to take the afflicted person behind him on the back of a grey horse at full speed and make a circuit round a <gai>‘comharra crìche,’<eng> march mark, and then round an immovable stone. Another cure common in the Isles was to tie a strong rope round the sufferer’s waist and drag him behind a <gai>‘dà-ràmhach,’ ‘ce’rach,’ ‘siarach,’ ‘ochdrach no deich-ràmhach,’<eng> two-, four-, six-, eight-, or ten-oared boat, with all the speed the rowers could achieve.

Another was to dip him in <gai>‘Tobar Ma-Ruibhe,’<eng> Maol Ruibhe’s well, in <gai>‘Eilean Ma-Ruibhe,’<eng> Maol-Ruibhe’s isle, in <gai>‘Loch Ma-Ruibhe,’<eng> Loch Maree. Men and women down to recent times, and possibly still, were brought from long distances to the sacred shrine of Maol-Ruibhe; in former days the pilgrimage was done openly, latterly by stealth.

Another famous place of cure was <gai>‘Poll Fhaolain,’<eng> St Faolan’s pool in Strath Fillan; here are two pools partly separated by a projecting rock, the upper called <gai>‘Poll nam Ban,’<eng> the pool of the women, the lower <gai>‘Poll nam Fear,’<eng> the pool of the men. The patient was led sunwise round the pool, first in name of Father, secondly in name of Son, thirdly in name of Spirit, and then immersed in the pool in name of the Trinity. He was led to <gai>‘Teampall Fhaolain,’<eng> St Faolan’s church. A small stone basin was filled with <gai>‘uisge coisrigte,’<eng> consecrated water, and poured over his head. He was stretched out with his back to the ground in the church, placed between two sticks, and bound in a simple ingenious way. If he extricated himself before morning there were hopes of recovery; if not, there was no hope. Sometimes he died during tht night. The person who dipped the patient in the pool lifted three small stones from the bottom and threw them on a cairn near by; sometimes a coin was also thrown into the cairn. A mad infuriated bull was thrown into <gai>‘Poll nam Ban’<eng> and thence sprang into <gai>‘Poll nam Fear,’<eng> since when both pools have lost their efficacy.

<gai>BEAN GUN CHLOINN:<eng> CHILDLESSNESS

AT Strolamas in Skye is a well called <gai>‘Tobar Cloinne’<eng> or <gai>‘Tobar na Cloinne,’<eng> the well of (the) children, the water of which conferred twin children upon a childless woman. The woman went to the well at dawn of day and drank of its water and appealed to its presiding deity, saying,

<gai>Uisg an easain air mo dhosan
. . . .
Tog dhìom do rosan rodaidh,
Is ùidh té na cabhaig orm.<eng>

The water of the little fall on my forelock
. . . . .
Lift thou from me thine ill mischance,
Since the wish of the woman of hurry is on me.

At Elgol, some miles away, is a well of similar virtues. In this case the wife and the husband must go to the well, drink of its water, and appeal to the guardian god of the fountain to listen to their prayer and to confer issue on them.

Every district of Scotland had a <gai>‘tobar slàinte,’<eng> healing fountain, whose water was clear and refreshing and whose situation was pleasing to the eye.

The plants <gai>‘trì-bhileach,’<eng> valerian or marsh-trefoil, and <gai>‘biolair Moire,’<eng> cress of Mary, water-cress, were given as a cure to childless women.


<gai>A’ CHÌOCH SHLUGAIN:<eng> THE UVULA

JOHN MACKENZIE, smith, Aultbea, Ross, said: <gai>Thuit mo chìoch agus fad latha no dhà cha b’urra dhomh càil a shlugadh no facal a labhairt.<eng>—My uvula fell and for a day or two I could neither swallow anything nor speak a word. My mother sent a man to William Campbell to tell him of my condition and ask him to cure me. During the messenger’s absence the uvula suddenly regained its position. The messenger on his return related that he had told William Campbell my name, and that Campbell went through a <gai>‘rann,’<eng> rune, appealing to the Three Persons of the Trinity to raise the uvula and heal me. William Campbell performed this cure for many persons throughout this wide district during his long life; he

[TD 204]

had a great reputation for the cure and for the beautiful rune he sang for it.

A narrator at Meallan Thearlaich, Gairloch, said: My <gai>‘cìoch shlugain,’<eng> uvula, had fallen, and my mother went to a certain woman, who made <gai>‘eòlas na cìche,’<eng> the charm of the uvula, for me, in my absence. The uvula returned to its place, and the time at which it returned agreed with the time at which the woman made the <gai>‘eòlas.’<eng>

Margaret Mackenzie, <gai>‘am Poll Glas,’<eng> Polglass, Achiltibuie, Ross, performed the cure as follows. She went to the strand and brought thence what were called <gai>‘na cìochagan tràghad,’<eng> uvulas from the strand. She hung them above the fire, which was on the floor (by some others they were placed on the <gai>‘slabhraidh,’<eng> pot-chain). She recited a <gai>‘rann,’<eng> rune, and raised the fallen uvula. This highly excellent woman had many charms and a <gai>‘rann’<eng> for each. Her son Roderick has learned some of them from her.

Another name for the uvula is <gai>‘an t-sineag.’<eng> There were some curious beliefs concerning it. <gai>‘Tha gead fuilt an crùn cinn neach a thogas a’ chìoch shlugain, ge b’e co aig am bheil fios air a’ ghead; leis a’ ghead a ghreimeachadh togaidh neach an t-sineag dh’a h-àite féin.’<eng>—There is a tuft of hair on the crown of the head that raises the uvula, whoever knows the tuft; by grasping the tuft a person can lift the uvula to its own place. <gai>‘Tha féith ann an caol an duirn, “féith chaol an duirn,” agus leis an fhuil a chur a suas anns an fhéith togaidh neach an t-sineag.’<eng>―There is a vein in the small of the wrist called ‘the wrist vein,’ and by driving the blood up the vein one can lift the uvula.―The hiccough be stopped by the same means.

A boy was stung in the foot by a serpent. He ran to a stream and bathed his wounded foot. Then, running back to see whether the serpent had succeeded in reaching the water, he met it hastening to the stream. He cut it in five pieces, which he buried in a hole in the earth, closing this firmly with a sod. If this is not done the maggots produced by the rotting serpent fly about in the air, and should one of them strike a person in the face cancer will result. So said John Beaton, grandson of the famous <gai>‘Fearchar Léigh,’<eng> Farquhar the Physician, Dunvegan.

It is said that the largest serpents in Scotland were in Mull. Goats were kept to reduce their numbers, and afterwards the big sheep practically killed them out, as they also killed out several plants indigenous to the soil, once well known, now never seen.


<gai>CUR NAM BALLAN:<eng> CUPPING*

CUPPING was done in various ways. One way was to burn a little spirit in a tumbler, and having thus exhausted the air in the glass, to place it immediately upon the part affected. This raised a blister, which was then pricked.

Murdoch Maclean, Breinish, Lewis, performs the operation of cupping, and thereby cures people of rheumatism and other complaints. His instrument is a cow’s horn, cast by the living animal. An air-opening is made by drilling through the point of the horn. Over the base is placed a piece of <gai>‘streafon,’<eng> the membrane covering a calf at birth or the after-birth, proverbially fine and tough. <gai>‘Moireal Nic Leòid,’<eng> Muriel MacLeod, crofter girl, aged twenty-six, described how Murdoch Maclean operated on her:—When I was sixteen or seventeen I went to Berwick on Tweed as laundry-maid. I was strong and healthy and well grown, but the work was heavy and the food did not suit one who had been used to plain simple fare. I became ill, and the doctor, unable to give me relief, advised me to go home, which I did. My symptoms were still distressing—if I leant forward my eyes filled with water and I could not see, and I had great pain and dizziness in my head. The doctors at Stornoway, Lochs and Tarbert treated me twelve times with the <gai>‘cuileaga Spàinneach,’<eng> fly-blisters, but all to no purpose; if no worse, I was certainly no better. I then went to Murdoch Maclean. He placed the <gai>‘ballan,’<eng> cup or horn, on the back of my neck, and sucked through it until he had raised a large


* See ii. 226.

[TD 206]

lump. He pricked this lump with a needle. Replacing the <gai>‘ballan,’<eng> he again sucked strongly and steadily. He applied the <gai>‘ballan’<eng> in all five times, four times on the first night and once on the following night, this time upon the other side of my neck. He thus drew two saucers full of clear water streaked with blood. I felt severe pain, as though racked from head to foot. The marks of the <gai>‘ballan’<eng> were deep in my flesh and the needle marks lasted a long time, but they were bathed and bandaged until they healed. I now feel as well and as healthy as I have ever felt in my life, and more than grateful to my kind benefactor Murdoch Maclean.


<gai>AN T-EÒLAS BALBH:<eng> THE DUMB CHARM

THE <gai>‘Eòlas Balbh’<eng> is for taking the <gai>‘goimh’<eng> out of <gai>‘losgadh,’<eng> the smart out of a burn. The person who performs it breathes lightly upon the sore and moves his hand above it, turning slowly, and uttering a short prayer the while for assuaging the pain. The pain ceases immediately, and the wound heals almost as soon.


<gai>GILEAS:<eng> WHITENESS

To cure <gai>‘an gileas,’<eng> whiteness upon the tongue in infants, put the blood of a cockerel’s comb upon the tongue, applying it with the cockerel’s tail feathers. This will remove the <gai>‘gileas’<eng> within a short time.


<gai>GREIM:<eng> STITCH

WERE a boy to get a <gai>‘greim,’<eng> stitch, in his side in playing or running or jumping, he would lie on the ground with the sore side under. He would make the sign of the cross over the side affected, saying,

<gai>‘Crois Chrìosda cheusda
Thoir éifeachd dha m’ phian.’<eng>

‘May the cross of Christ crucified
Be assuaging my pain.’

Innumerable phrases and sayings of this nature are common among the people, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike.

<gai>TEINE DÉ:<eng> GOD’S FIRE

<gai>‘TEINE Dé’<eng> or <gai>‘teine Diaidh,’<eng> ‘God’s fire,’ denotes ringworm, for which there were many cures. Children bandied words over it, often in hot resentment. The following was a frequent rime in these encounters.

<gai>Teine Dé da do bhus!
Rug do mhàthair chéile luch;
Thug thu féin a mach an gur,
Busan dubh an dranndain!<eng>

<gai>TIONNDADH CRIDHE:<eng> DISPLACEMENT OF THE HEART

From Elspet Sutherland, crofter, Bay View Cottage, West Helmsdale

THE following is a cure to replace the heart after fright: Go to a stream under a bridge over which the living and the dead pass. Take water from the stream in a wooden <gai>‘cuach,’<eng> cup. Lift three stones from the stream in the name of the Father, of the Son, of the Spirit. One stone must be round to represent the head; one stone must be triangular to represent the heart; one stone must be oblong to represent the body. Put these three stones into the <gai>‘cuach’<eng> of water and carry them home. Put the stones one by one into the fire until they are red-hot. Then take one stone out of the fire and place it in the water in the <gai>‘cuach,’<eng> observing carefully for how long it fizzled in the water before it was cooled. Do the same to the second and the third stones. The stone which makes the most prolonged and mournful sound indicates the seat of trouble, whether it be head, heart or body that is affected. [The account seems to be incomplete.]

EÒLAS AN SGUCHAIDH

<eng>SPRAIN is variously called <gai>‘sguchadh,’ ‘sguthadh,’ ‘sgiuchadh,’ ‘sgochadh,’ ‘sguch,’ ‘sguth,’ ‘sgiuch,’ ‘sgoch,’ ‘siachadh,’ ‘siach’; ‘sguchadh féithe,’<eng> sprain of sinew; <gai>‘sguchadh lùthaidh,’<eng> sprain of joint; <gai>‘siachadh féithe,’<eng> strain of sinew, and <gai>‘siachadh lùthaidh,’<eng> strain of joint.

<gai>‘Eòlas an sguchaidh,’<eng> the knowledge or charm of the sprain, is the invocation repeated during the rubbing of the injured limb. In this rubbing an extract of St John’s wort or some other specific is applied, to moisten and relieve the part. Rubbing and singing proceed together; the rubbing is done soothingly and skilfully, and the hymn is sung tenderly and sympathetically. The hymn is punctuated throughout with something like a snort, or a small emission of breath between the slightly opened teeth.

The man or woman who operates provides himself or herself with a three-plied cord of hard lint, lint being sacred to Christ. This he divides into three parts of equal length. He makes a hard knot on the first part, breathing on it and touching the knot with his lips in the name of God the Father. He makes a second knot, touching it with his lips in the name of God the Son, and a third knot, touching it with his lips in the name of God the Spirit. He then ties the cord round the limb in the name of<gai>

the Sacred Father, of the Sacred Son, of the Sacred Spirit. So with the second and third parts of the cord. There are thus thrice three knots upon the cord altogether. The cord is called <gai>‘tolm.’<eng>

With some, the cord is passed through the mouth and left in the mouth during the recital of the rune. The knot is drawn in the mouth, the first knot when the operator appeals to God the Father, the second when he appeals to God the Son, the third when he appeals to God the Spirit. With others, the knot is in the mouth while the operator utters the name of the man or woman or animal being treated. One operator used no knots.

This and every other charm is performed in reliance on the power of God, never on the performer’s own skill.

Another treatment was described as follows. <gai>‘Tha crois ’ga cur le sùith air an sgocha an ainm nan Trì ta crochte air an t-slabhraidh. Tha an sùith ’ga fhàgail air a’ chois no air an làimh gon am falbh e uidh ar n-uidh.’<eng>—The sign of the cross is made in soot upon the sprain in name of the Three Who hang on the pot-chain.

EÒLAS NAN NEÒN: <eng>THE CHARM OF THE STYES

<gai>‘GRIG,’ ‘grige,’ ‘grìd,’ ‘grìde,’<eng> are similar in meaning and denote a mite, a tiny insect or animalcule, a microbe. The old people speak of <gai>‘grig an neònain,’<eng> the microbe of the stye, as they speak of <gai>‘grig na niosgaid,’<eng> the microbe of the boil, <gai>‘grige lionnrachaid,’<eng> the microbe of suppuration, and of various kinds of swellings.

<gai>Grige grànda màthair contrachd.<eng>

Ugly microbe, mother of mischief.

<gai>Is lugh e na grìd,
Màthair nimh nàimhdeis.<eng>

’Tis smaller than a mite,
The virulent mother of enmity.

It was interesting and instructive to listen to these unlettered old men and women describing <gai>‘mar bha mhàthair-ghuir ghrige toir a nìos a droch àil, ag adhbharachadh buirb agus coirb ann am fuil agus ann am feòil dhaoine’<eng>—‘how the hatching-mother of the “grig” brought up her bad brood, causing gall and venom in the blood and flesh of people.’ <gai>‘Cia mar bha mhàthair-ghuir ghrige faighinn agus a’ fàs ann am fuil agus ann am feòil neach cha robh e farasda thuigsinn na farasd innseadh; ach aon rud,—far an robh droch thaidhe agus droch ghleidheadh bha ghrige-ghuir an sin, agus i a’ ruith bho neach gu neach agus bho theach gu teach mar chleachd an droch sgeula.’<eng>—‘How the hatching-mother of the “grig” got into the blood and flesh of a person and grew there it was not easy to understand nor easy to explain; but one thing,—where there were ill care and ill keeping the hatching-“grig” was there, running from person to person and from house to house like the wont of the ill tale (ill tidings are wont to do).’

The stye has a variety of names: <gai>‘neòn,’ ‘neònan,’ ‘neònagan’; ‘leòn,’ ‘leònad,’ ‘leònadan,’ ‘leòna,’ ‘leònag,’ ‘leònagan’; ‘sleòn,’ ‘sleònan,’ ‘sleònagan’; ‘sleamh,’ ‘sleamhnan,’ ‘sleamhnagan,’<eng> etc.

A certain plant, which the writer has not identified, was called <gai>‘lus na sùla’<eng> or <gai>‘lus nan sùl,’<eng> the plant of the eye or the eyes; the eye was bathed with the essence obtained by bruising the plant.

The method of curing the stye varied from district to district; the most usual method has been described already (ii. 72 f.). Another method was

[TD 219]

to rub a finger-ring round and round the stye while repeating a rime thus:

and so on up to nine, eighteen or twenty-four, without once stopping or drawing breath. It is certain that styes were cured, but perhaps by the long-continued rubbing rather than by the charm.

<gai>‘Eòlas nan Neòn,’<eng> the charm of the styes, must be confided by a man to a woman and by a woman to a man.

The performance of the following charm is accompanied by a thrust towards the stye with a pin, a needle, or some other sharp-pointed instrument.

<gai>Tillim ort, a neòn,
An eòl Athar!		[Sàth]

Tillim ort, a neòn,

Simultaneously with the thrusting towards the stye, the following reproving lines are hissed through the teeth at the <gai>‘grig’<eng> or <gai>‘grìd,’<eng>

Another method is to twirl a glowing splinter of wood around before the eye, while counting out the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> without taking breath. The counting is from one to seven, from one seven to two sevens, from two sevens to three sevens, then down from three sevens to two sevens, from two sevens to one seven, and from one seven to one,—<gai>‘Aon gu dhà, dhà gu trì, … sia gu seachd, seachd eile gu seachd, seachd gu seachd eile, aon thar fichead gu ceithir-diag,’<eng> etc. The performer then threatens the <gai>‘grig’<eng> with the fiery splinter, saying:—

Take thy feet with thee promptly,

Take thy feet with thee, impudent!
Take thy deceiving feet!
Take thy feet with thee, paltry,

<gai>EÒLAS NAM FOINNE:<eng> THE CHARM OF THE WARTS

THE reciter did not remember the rune. In order to charm away warts one procures <gai>‘naoi naoi glùnanan shop arbhair no feòir,’<eng> nine nine joints of stalks of corn or of hay. These are placed in a small bag and buried nine nine joint-lengths in the ground

<gai>Ann an ainm Athar,
Ann an ainm Mic,
Ann an ainm Spioraid,
Triùir innich nam buadh.<eng>

In the name of Father,
In the name of Son,
In the name of Spirit,
The perfect Three of power.

As the joints decayed in the earth, the warts decayed in the air until none remained.

If the little bag containing the nine nine joints were thrown away, and another person took it up, the warts would be transferred to the finder. This, however, is not considered honourable, and is rarely done by the most careless boy or girl.

The nine-jointed stalk is

<gai>Sop nan naoi sop
Gu tilleadh air na foinneachan.<eng>

The wisp of nine stalks
To make the warts retreat.

A woman of Upper Bornish, who had many warts on hands and feet, procured with time and trouble <gai>‘naoi naoi glùinean,’<eng> nine nine knees, i.e. nine stalks with nine joints on each stem. These she buried in the ground, and as the knots of the straws decayed, the warts disappeared.

<gai>Mar a chrìon a sìos na stràilleanan,
Chrìon gu bràth na foinneachan.<eng>

As withered down the straws,
Withered till doom the warts.

Another cure was to rub dry rust upon the wart, or to apply moist rust to it. Those near the sea applied a poultice of the broad-leaved tangle to the wart. Even medical men will appreciate this cure from the iodine contained in the tangle.

‘Go to the churchyard and dip the wart in water lying on a gravestone. The wart will disappear in a day or two.’
‘Rub the wart against the clothes of one who has committed fornication.’ A certain gentleman said that, having done this, he was utterly surprised to find the wart disappear in two days.

A wart was a good omen according to the sex of the person and the position of the wart.

<gai>Am foinne mu’n iadh a’ ghlac,
Is niarach am mac a chì;
Am foinne mu’n iadh a’ bhròg,
Is niarach an òigh dh’am bì.<eng>

The wart which the closed hand surrounds,
Fortunate is the youth who sees it;
The wart which the shoe surrounds,
Fortunate is the maid who has it.

AN CAIMEAN: <eng>THE MOTE<gai>

THUBHAIRT Eóghan Dùghallach, croitear, Meallaig: Bha mo bhràthair agus mi fhéin ag iasgach sgadain thall an Loch Shubhairn. Laigh lann sgadain air sùil mo bhràthar agus bha e ann an cràdh cruaidh. Chaidh sinn gu boireannach ann an Sgiathairigh aig an robh Eòlas a’ Chaimein chon an caimean a thoir a sùil mo bhràthar. Rinn am boireannach Eòlas a’ Chaimein, ach ma rinn, cha d’fhàg an caimean an t-sùil. Dhubh dh’fhairtlich a’ chùis air a’ bhoireannach, rud a chuir campar oirre fhìn agus iongnadh oirnne, oir bha am boireannach iomraiteach anns na dùthchannan air son Eòlas a’ Chaimein.

Thàinig sinn air falbh gu tighinn dachaidh. A nall aig Sanndaig dh’fhairich mo bhràthair crith cas agus cràdh cruaidh ’na shùil, co clis ri clisgeadh an dealanaich. ‘Dh’fhalbh e!’ arsa mo bhràthair. ‘An d’fhalbh,’ arsa mise, ‘Mhoire, ’s ann agadsa bha feum air a sin!’ Sheall mi fhéin air an t-sùil, agus bha lann an sgadain air falbh gun teagamh. Thug sinn taing a Dhia mór nan dùl, do Chrìosd agus dh’an Mhoire mhìn Mhàthair, agus thill sinn air ais air a’ chas-cheum an taobh an tàinig sinn.

Chunnaic am boireannach a rinn an t-eòlas am bàta tighinn agus chomhlaich i sinn anns a’ chladach. Mun d’fhuair sinne tighinn as an eathair dh’eubh am boireannach ruinn gun deachaidh aice air a’ chaimean mu dheireadh. ‘Anacreideamh dona thàinig am charadh agus a laigh mar dhubhar air m’anam; ach ghuidh mi air Dia nan gràs mo chomhnadh agus mo chuideachadh agus mo chumhachd a thoir domh air ais, agus rinn e sin ’na chaomh thròcair agus ’na mhór mhathas féin.

<eng>Messages came to Mary Macmillan from far and near, and she never failed to remove the mote. She was beloved and respected throughout her long life, and herself and others believed in her occult powers.

A descendant of hers, Mary Cameron of Sgiathairigh, had <gai>‘Eòlas an Sguchaidh,’<eng> the Charm for Sprain. She performed it with success for man and beast. I went to her from Ardchattan in Lorne, travelling up Glen Orchy, down the Black Mount, by the Moor of Rannoch, Lochaber, Fort William, through the Garbhchrioch (Rough Bound) and Arasaig on to Mallaig. Thence I took boat by night along the Linne Shléiteach (Sound of Sleat), past Cnòideart (Knoydart), and into Loch Shubhairn (Loch Hourn), arriving at Arnisdale late at night. Next morning I took boat for Sgiathairigh near Ceann Loch Shubhairn (Loch Hourn-head). I found Mary Cameron a pleasant and hospitable woman, but on no account would she repeat to me <gai>‘Eòlas a’ Chaimein,’<eng> though I tried every possible means to persuade her. She said that the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> was entrusted to her for no foolish purpose, and she was not going to impart it for any foolish purpose to any person. On the following morning I took boat to Eilean Diarmaid (Isle Ornsay) to meet the steamer for Mallaig, whence by train to Edinburgh. It was a long, costly and, alas, disappointing journey, like many similar ones.

Christina Mackay, Bun Ilidh (Helmsdale), could remove the mote from the eye at a distance of many miles. She was a famous and a wonderful woman. Doctors derided her, but they could not deny her achievements.

William Polson, crofter and fisherman, Helmsdale, had the power to remove a mote from the eye without personal contact. On one occasion he found an insect peculiar to man in his mouth after the operation, after which he gave up doing the <gai>‘caimein.’<eng>

William Ross, elder, Kincardine, Ross, could remove a mote from the eye many miles away. Like others who possessed this power, he could show the mote upon the point of his tongue, and often did this. He was an industrious and prosperous crofter, and an obliging neighbour. His people were known as <gai>‘Na Gobhaichean,’<eng> the smiths; <gai>‘Gobhaichean Ruadha Achadh nan Gart,’<eng> the red smiths of Achnagart, Strath Kyle.

Donald Murray, farm grieve, Arcan, Urray, near Dingwall, said: When I was a youth, I was bringing home a load of peats to a woman in Edderton, Ross. A bit of <gai>‘culm,’<eng> dust, went into my eye. I told the woman about my eye. ‘We will soon cure that,’ said she. Fetching a small basin of water, she said a rime over the water. I understood that she appealed to the great God Who created the eye to help her faith and to grant her request. I felt a sharp twitch in my eye and called out, <gai>‘Dh’fhalbh e,’<eng> ‘It has gone.’ She showed me a bit of peat <gai>‘culm’<eng> floating on the water. ‘That,’ said she, ‘is the <gai>“smùirnein,”<eng> mote, that was in your eye.’

Alexander Campbell, Conon, said: My master said to me, ‘My wife cannot get a wink of sleep owing to a mote that has gone into her eye. Go you to Mrs Mackinnon in Arcan and ask her to take the mote (<gai>“durdan”<eng>) out of my wife’s eye.’ Mrs Mackinnon made the <gai>‘eòlas,’<eng> and took a little tiny bit of corn husk out of her mouth and put it in a small basin of water in her hand. … My good mistress had been working among sids, or corn husks, to make sowens. I marked the time when I left; it was half-past eight. Next morning my master said, ‘My wife is quite better; at half-past eight last night she cried out that the thing had left her eye. By the King Himself; Mrs Mackinnon is good! (<gai>a Rìgh fhéin, is math bean Mhic Fhionghain!’<eng>).

Kate Macphail, née Ross, cottar, Bishop’s Kinkell, Conon Bridge, related how her brother suffered agony from a barley awn in his right eye. She went to Donald Mackinnon in Arcan, Urray, some four miles away. He made the charm and placed the awn on his tongue before her. ‘That,’ said he, ‘is the <gai>“calg,”<eng> awn, that was in your brother’s eye, and he has relief now.’ That was so. Her brother felt a sudden twinge in his eye, and the thing was gone.

John Maclennan, crofter, said: My brother and I were working down in Fortrose (<gai>‘shìos anns a’ Chananaich’<eng>). We were sitting, eating a hard biscuit for dinner. In play I struck my brother’s hand from below and the half-eaten biscuit flew up in his face. A bit of it went into his eye. The medical man of the place failed to remove the mote and my

[TD 233]

brother suffered much for two days. Then I went to Mary Mackenzie in <gai>‘Bràigh Arcain’<eng> (the upper part of Arcandeith in the Black Isle), near Tore Farm. She rose at once and made <gai>‘Eòlas a’ Chaimein,’<eng> the Charm of the Mote. She put three small pebbles in a small basin of clear clean water in name of the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity. She then drew a mouthful of water from the basin, but not finding the <gai>‘caimean’<eng> she put out the mouthful of water in the ashes beside the fire on the floor. She did this a second and a third time, and felt in her mouth for the mote. She got the mote upon her tongue and poured that mouthful back into the basin. ‘That is the mote that was in your brother’s eye,’ she said to me. <gai>‘Bha rann aig a’ bhoireannach a’ dèanamh a’ chaimein, ach cha tug mise liom ach facal an seo is an sud. Ach thug mi aire gu math gun do ghuidh am boireannach air Dia nan dùl an caimean a bha an sùil Dhomhnaill Mhic ’ill-Fhinnein a chur air a teangaidh.’<eng>—The woman had a rime in making the ‘caimean,’ but I took with me only a word here and there of it. But I observed well that the woman prayed to the God of life to put on her tongue the mote that was in Donald Maclennan’s eye.

Mr MacLeod, station-master, Diùirinis, Loch Alsh, saw practised a charm for removing a thing from the eye. A lad, while threshing in the barn, got a bit of straw in his eye. He told a neighbour, who went to a stream and filled his mouth with water therefrom, mentally repeating the words of <gai>‘Eòlas a’ Chaimein,’<eng> with the water in his mouth. He then poured the water on the palm of his hand. He moved the water in his palm with a stalk of grass, and allowed it to leak through his fingers, and there remained on his palm a small bit of straw that came out of the eye. The youth did not know that the neighbour was performing the <gai>‘eòlas,’<eng> but he felt the <gai>‘caimean’<eng> leaving the eye. Mr MacLeod saw the thing done and heard <gai>‘rann an eòlais,’<eng> the rime of the charm, but could not remember it.

Mr Donald Mackechnie, Edinburgh, the well-known and highly gifted writer in Gaelic, said: I was in a house in Jura (his native island) when a messenger came to ask the woman of the house to remove a mote from the eye of a man at a distance. The woman promptly got up and put water in a basin and said a short prayer in rhythmical form. She drew up a mouthful of water from the basin and having felt for something upon her tongue she poured back the water into the basin. Having carefully examined the water in the basin, she said, ‘There is a small hair here. I do not know whether or not this is the mote that was in the eye of Donald Darroch; but whether it be or not, I know by myself that the mote has left the eye and the man has got relief.’ We all looked in the basin and saw a small hair on the surface of the water. It looked like the hair of an eyelid or of an eyebrow. Donald Darroch’s eyelids and eyebrows were fair, while the woman’s were black. I made a mental note of the time, and having bade good-night to the company I walked straight to the house of Donald Darroch. Without disclosing what I had seen in the house of John Blue, I discovered that Donald Darroch had had a small

[TD 234]

hair in his eye, which his wife had failed to remove, but that it had left the eye at the moment the woman made the charm. I have read many works of science and philosophy since then, but I have never chanced upon any explanation of how this occult power was obtained and used.


<gai>EÒLAS NA SMÙIRNE:<eng> CHARM FOR THE MOTE

THIS charm was got in November 1905 from Peggy Ross, of over seventy years of age, wife of John Maclean, crofter, <gai>Achadh nan Gart, Slios a’ Chaolais<eng> (Kyle-side), Kincardine, Ross.

The woman got a basin of water, and filled her mouth with water out of a bowl or small basin, saying:—

<gai>A Chrìosda th’air a’ chrois.<eng>

Thou Christ on the cross.

She then put the water back into the basin from her mouth. She then filled her mouth again with water, saying:—

<gai>Tha mis a’ cur m’ùidh
An Rìgh nan dùl.<eng>

I am placing my trust
In the King of life.

She then put the water back into the basin. She then drew up a third mouthful, saying:—

<gai>Gun tig an nì tha san t-sùil . . aig . . as.<eng>

That that which is in the . . eye of . . come out therefrom.

(Here the person is named and the right or left eye specified.)

The sister of the woman, older than she, was sent out while the ceremony was being performed, as no other woman must be present. The husband and son of the operator were allowed to remain. The sister came in again immediately after, and sat beside the operator while the latter went over the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> a second time. She went over it several times in order to ensure that I had it rightly noted down.

The woman said that she had removed the <gai>‘smùirnein,’<eng> mote, many many times by this <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> from the eyes of people still living, and also from the eyes of cows and horses. Some of the people were far away, in Edinburgh and Glasgow, while she was in Achadh nan Gart.

She believes in this as firmly as that she must die, and so do the others of the family.

AN CAIMEIN

<eng>THE reciter, Isabel Calder, crofter, Tulloch, Bonar Bridge, Sutherland, says that she got the power of the Eye Charm from her father Finlay Calder.

Her father was famous throughout his district for his occult powers. Without personal contact with the sufferer, he could remove a mote from the eye and stop bleeding; he could also cure chest-contraction. All these cures he performed many times, never unsuccessfully. He always prayed that the mote in the eye might be placed upon his tongue, and this always happened. On one occasion, however, he found that the mote which was removed from the eye to his tongue was an insect. From the disgust this caused him he contracted jaundice. After this he prayed the great God of life to place the mote from the eye upon his hand, instead of upon his<gai>

tongue, and this always happened. The reciter gave many examples, from her father’s experience and from her own, of the removal of the mote by means of occult powers. These mysterious manifestations are beyond the writer’s power to explain.

Finlay Calder is spoken of throughout his district as a good man, and as a good Christian of marvellous miracles. He died at the age of seventy-two years. How he exercised such powers no one can explain, but the people of his district explicitly maintain that he did so.

The reciter says that she herself always feels a bitter, disagreeable taste in her mouth after performing the cure.<gai>

<gai>A’ GHLACACH:<eng> THE CHEST SEIZURE

THE ‘chest seizure’ was much dreaded throughout the Highlands and Islands. In the old Statistical Account of Scotland the Rev. Dr Thomas Bisset of Logierait says: ‘There is a disease called <gai>“glacach”<eng> by the Highlanders, which, as it affects the chest and lungs, is evidently of a consumptive nature. It is also called “the MacDonalds’ disease,” because there are particular tribes of MacDonalds who are believed to cure it with the charms of their touch and the use of a certain set of words. There must be no fee given of any kind. Their faith in the touch of a MacDonald is very great.’ The disease is still called <gai>‘tinneas,’ ‘glac’<eng> or <gai>‘glacach nan Domhnallach’<eng> or <gai>‘Chlann Domhnaill,’<eng> according to some of my informants, for the reason given by Dr Bisset, according to others, because a certain sept of the MacDonalds were peculiarly liable to it. In Skye the complaint is called <gai>‘glagach nan Domhnallach.’<eng> Other names are <gai>‘glacach’ (‘cleacach’), ‘glac,’ ‘na glacaich,’ ‘na glacaichean,’<eng> seizure or the seizures; <gai>‘glacach cléibhe,’<eng> etc., chest seizure or seizures; <gai>‘caitheamh,’<eng> consumption; <gai>‘iomairt,’<eng> struggle, <gai>‘iomairt cléibhe,’<eng> chest struggle; <gai>‘cuinge cléibhe’<eng> or <gai>‘cuingeach chléibhe,’ ‘a’ chuingleach’<eng> or <gai>‘a’ chunglach,’ ‘cuingealach’<eng> or <gai>‘cuigealach cléibhe,’<eng> constriction or chest constriction; <gai>‘coilleas’<eng> or <gai>‘coillteas,’ ‘na coilleasaichean’<eng> or <gai>‘na coillteasaichean,’ ‘calltmas,’ ‘an corran,’ ‘cliatha,’ ‘cliathanan’; ‘na clisichean cléibhe,’<eng> the chest spasms; <gai>‘an galar toll,’<eng> the hollow disease; <gai>‘cuidichean’<eng> or <gai>‘cuidichean cléibhe.’<eng> The charm for counteracting it is called <gai>‘eòlas nan glacach,’ ‘eòlas nan glac’, ‘eòlas nan glacaichean cléibhe,’ ‘eòlas na caitheimh,’ ‘eòlas iomairt cléibhe,’ ‘eòlas a’ chorrain,’ ‘eòlas a’ ghalair tholl,’<eng> etc.


In this disease, according to the narrators, the bones of the thorax close together and press upon the <gai>‘cridhe agus sgamhan agus grùthan,’<eng> heart, lungs and liver, constricting them and reducing their blood supply, and causing consumption and death. To counteract this, a powerful but well controlled massage is applied. The person who operates grasps and clutches and fingers and rubs the patient to and fro, up and down, this way and that, hither and thither. <gai>‘Tha e toir na feòil agus nan cnàmh agus nam féith agus nan alt as a chéile, agus a’ suathadh eòlain no ìm no uachdar anns an neach atà tinn, agus ’ga chur a steach thromh an chruas. Is e obair mhór a tha seo, ach a dhèanamh ceart obair làmh agus chinn agus chridhe—Mhoire, ’s ann a sin tha an obair! Agus leis a sin is iad làmhan fireannaich is fearr a nì a’ ghlacach cléibhe seach làmhan boireann-

aich. Cha mhór bhoireannach aig a bheil greim co cruaidh agus co teann agus co treasa ri greim fireannaich. Chunnaic mi turas agus turas mi a’ toir neach o’n bhàs fo làimh Dhé nan dùl leis na glacaichean cléibhe.’<eng>—‘He is taking the flesh and the bones and the sinews and the joints asunder, and rubbing oil or butter or cream into the sick person, and driving it through the hardness. All this is a great work, but to do this rightly is work of hands and head and heart—Mary, that is the work indeed! And with that, it is men’s hands that can better deal with the chest seizure than the hands of women. Not many women have a grip so hard and so firm and so powerful as a man’s grip. Time and again I have seen myself, under the hand of the God of life, winning a person from death from the chest seizure.’ The patient’s arms are worked in all directions, his knuckles meeting behind his back. His shoulder-blades are pressed and worked to and fro, and every fibre of the upper part of his body is thoroughly roused. The rubbing may be continued for an hour and administered daily or several times daily for a week, two weeks, or more. Girls and women are supposed to be particularly liable to this disease. Children of both sexes who seemed to be threatened by it, or whose physical development was not satisfactory, were made by their parents to perform <gai>‘cleasa nàdair,’<eng> physical drill or remedial exercises of various kinds, such as travelling hand by hand from one couple to another of the barn roof.

The liniments used are various. <gai>‘Blonag mhuc gun leaghadh,’<eng> unmelted hog’s lard, <gai>‘armadh clòimh’<eng> and <gai>‘lì armaidh,’<eng> oil for smearing wool, drawn seal oil, the oil of the <gai>‘corra ghritheach,’<eng> heron or crane, the oil of deer’s horns, <gai>‘ola dhurn mhart,’<eng> neat’s-foot oil, strong spirits and <gai>‘garbh ghucag,’<eng> foreshot, are all good.

This does not exhaust the physical treatment. The patient is advised to drink milk warm from the cow; in Tiree they have home-made <gai>‘crogain chriadh,’<eng> clay crocks, into which they milk the cow, and the patient drinks the milk straight from the crock. He is made to eat <gai>‘feòil mhiath air a gearradh gu mìn meanbh,’<eng> fat (or tender) meat cut small and fine, to live in the open air, and to keep <gai>‘ri cùl gaoithe ’s ri aghaidh gréine,’<eng> at the back of the wind and in the face of the sun. The patient comes to live in the house of the person who works the cure, and remains there until a cure is effected. No charge is ever made for either the treatment or the lodging, these kindly people doing it all, as they say, for the love of Him Whose example they are following.

The <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> is transmitted from man to woman and from woman to man. The person who performs the treatment places his two palms on the floor or ground before beginning. On finishing, he must wash his hands in water, in running water if possible. A man who was in the way of ‘making the <gai>“glacaichean”’<eng> had the habit of placing his hands on his hips each time he took them off the patient. He suffered much from this, not knowing why, till one day a <gai>‘bean shiubhail,’<eng> travelling woman, came the way. <gai>‘Thubhairt am boireannach ris gum bu chòir dha daonnan

[TD 251]

a làmhan a sgoladh ann am burn fuar, ann an allt ruith. Rinn an duine mar a dh’iarr a’ bhean, agus cha d’fhuiling e dragh tuilleadh.’<eng>—The woman told him that he should always rinse his hands in cold water, in a running stream. The man did as the woman enjoined, and suffered no more trouble.

Some of the men and women who ‘do the <gai>“glacaichean”’<eng> profess to be able to transfer the complaint from one person to another. The mother of William Maclennan, Bog an Dùraidh, was removing the seizure from a man when another man present derided her. <gai>‘An leig thu liom an cur ort féin, a dhuine mhath?’ ars am boireannach. ‘Dearbha fhéin, leigidh, agus do dhìol dhiubh—uiread agus uiread agus is urrainn dhuit.’ ‘Sìn thu féin air a’ bhord,’ ars a’ bhean, ‘agus fosgail brollach do léine.’ Shìn am fear fanaid e féin air a’ bhord agus dh’fhosgail e bhrollach o bharr gu bhonn. An àite na glacaichean a chur air an làr mar a b’àbhaist dhi, is ann a chuir a’ bhean air bràigh brollach an duine iad, gon an robh e ag eubhach agus ag achanaich le cràdh.<eng>—‘Will you let me put the seizures on yourself, good man?’ said the woman. ‘’Deed and indeed, I will, and as much as you like of them—as much as ever you can.’ ‘Stretch yourself on the table,’ said the woman, ‘and open the breast of your shirt.’ The mocker stretched himself on the table and opened his breast from top to bottom. The woman, instead of putting the seizures upon the floor as she was wont, put them on the upper part of the man’s breast, until he was calling out and imploring with pain. The original patient sprang up, lithe of limb and ready of tongue, and said, <gai>‘Seo a nis, a mhicein, croit a’ bhodaich air a’ mhagaire!’<eng>—‘Here now, sonnie, the carle’s hump upon the derider!’ The mocker was going about from place to place and from doctor to doctor in search of healing, but no healing could he find. Repentant of heart and apologetic of mien he came to the woman whom he had been reviling, and she relieved him as he asked. After that he had nothing but praise where before he had only scorn and blame.

TUITEAMAS

<eng>THERE are various strange cures for <gai>‘tuiteamas,’ ‘tinneas tuiteamais,’ ‘tinneas tuitmeis,’<eng> the falling sickness, epilepsy. The juice of juniper berries is useful. A <gai>‘famh,’<eng> mole, held up by the tail above the patient’s breath until it dies relieves if it does not cure the disease. Corn and the points of the patient’s nails are buried in the earth along with a live cock. If the living sacrifice of a live cock, drake or gander, buried alive where the epileptic fell, were made with the first attack, no second attack would ever occur. An intelligent woman at Evanton, Ross, said: A boy whose sister had an epileptic fit came to fetch a black cock that my mother had. The cock was buried where the epileptic fell. The girl is now a middle-aged woman and has never had a recurrence of epilepsy since that day. A minister in Ross writes: I mentioned to my mother-in-law the living burial of the black cock at Evanton. She said that she had seen a girl seized with an epileptic fit on the second floor of a house. Immediately a hole was made through the floor at the spot where the girl fell, a second hole through the floor below, and a hole dug in the earth beneath. Then a black cock was procured and lowered through the two floors and buried alive in the pit below. Some years ago a boat was crossing Loch Duthaich from Letterfearn to Dornie when a man in the boat had an epileptic fit. The other men took bearings, turned back, and brought out a live black cock with a stone in a sack. On regaining their former position they threw the sack into the sea. The man who had the fit has never had another.

GREIM MIONAICH NO SEIRG

Bho Chatrìona Nic Ghill-Eathain, croitear, Nàst, Gearrloch

THÀINIG coigreach turas a chon taighe oidhche dhudarra dhorcha gheamhraidh, agus dh’iarr e cuid oidhche agus fasgadh bho na siantan searbh a muigh. Thubhairt bean an taighe nach faigheadh, nach robh dòigh aice dha. Thubhairt fear an taighe gum faigheadh; nach do chuir esan no duine dh’a dhaoine riamh neach air falbh bho’n doras.

Chaidh am boireannach a mach dh’an sgiobal agus chuir i leabaidh air dòigh do’n choigreach ann an tom cuilg, agus dh’iarr i air a laighe innte. Rinn an coigreach mar a dh’iarradh air, agus laigh e sìos anns an leabaidh a rinn am boireannach dha air an torr chuilg.

Bha bean an taighe ann an càs cruaidh, a bhith faicinn a fir dol chon na sìorraidheachd agus gun dòigh aice air a chumail, gun alt aice air faochadh a thoir dha. Bha i sileadh nan deur agus a’ fàsgadh nan dorn, agus i leatha féin agus gun fhios aice fo ghréin ciod e theireadh no dhèanadh i. Chuimhnich i an sin air an duine anns an sgiobal, agus chaidh i mach, is dhùisg i an coigreach, agus ghuidh i air tighinn a steach g’a comhnadh. Chuir an coigreach uime agus thàinig e steach, agus thubhairt e—

Is fear fialaidh marbh;

EÒLAS NAM MÀM

‘MÀM,’ <eng> a low rounded swelling hill, is commonly used of various swellings on the body, as <gai>‘màm sléisne,’<eng> swelling in the groin, <gai>‘màm achlais,’<eng> swelling in the armpit, <gai>‘màm seic,’ ‘màm sic,’<eng> rupture (also <gai>‘maidhm seic’), ‘màm amhcha,’<eng> swelling in the neck, mumps. The rite of curing the <gai>‘màm’<eng> was common throughout the Highlands and Islands, though differing more or less from place to place.

In the north-western mainland there are many hills called <gai>‘Màm,’<eng> with some qualifying term, and the object of the incantation is to transfer to such hills the swelling on the patient’s body. These hills must be known to the operator himself, and must be places over which the living and the dead have passed. The operator provides himself with a pin, a needle, or the tongue of a brooch, a block of wood, a basin of clean cold water, and an axe. He makes the sign of the cross on the tablet of his face an on the tablet of his heart, and says the Prayer of the Lord, the Prayer of Mary, and <gai>‘Eòlas nam Màm,’<eng> the incantation of the swellings. He divides the swelling into three imaginary sections, each subdivided into three, making nine in all. This is called <gai>‘àireamh nam màm,’<eng> numbering the swellings. He lays the needle upon each section as he proceeds. He takes the axe and dips its edge into the water in the basin. He swings the axe over his head and aims a blow with all his might at the needle, which is held by an assistant upon the appropriate section of the swelling. At the moment of apparent contact the axe is arrested as if by some unseen<gai>

THE CHARM OF THE SWELLINGS

power, and it touches the needle only gently. Its edge falls at right angles to the needle, so that a cross is formed. The axe is then diverted to the block of wood on the floor, into which it is driven with force, while <gai>‘fear bualadh nam màm,’<eng> the striker of the swellings, utters the appropriate part of the incantation—<gai>‘Biodh sin air Màm Ràtagain,’<eng> ‘Be that upon the Màm of Ràtagan.’ After three successive strokes, on three successive sections of the swelling, the operator intones the names of the Three Persons of the Trinity, and then rests to draw breath. This is therefore done three times, until each of the nine sections has been treated, and nine hills have been named, both the sections and the hills being taken sunwise.

<gai>‘Bualadh nam màm,’<eng> striking the swellings, is extremely trying to the nerves of the beholder, and still more so to those of the patient, who knows that instant death may follow failure to stay the axe. The nervous system must be considerably affected. It is said that the operation is successful, the swelling subsiding as it proceeds.

The <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> was obtained from Angus Gillies, crofter, A’ Mhormhach, Arasaig, on St Michael’s Day, 1909, from Flora Maclennan, née Matheson, Dornie, Kintail, and from others. It was also obtained in Mull, where there are twelve hills called <gai>‘Màm’—Màm Doire Chuilinn, Màm Liorainn, Màm Bhreabadail, Màm an Tiompain, Màm Brathadail, Màm an Lochain, Màm Chlachaig, Màm an tSnodanaich, Màm na Croise, Màm Thapaill, Màm Dhoire Dhubhaig, Màm Gaoithe.

[Agus canaidh gach neach a làthair, Amen.]

<eng>In the Outer Isles there are no hills called <gai>‘Màm,’<eng> and the operation of cure is confined to the use of the needle or other sharp-pointed instrument, as in curing the stye. The instrument was pointed frowningly at the swelling nine times, and after each thrust the operator said—<gai>

CASGADH FALA: <eng>CHECKING OF BLOOD<gai>

‘CASGADH fala,’ <eng>checking of blood, connotes the power of certain persons to stop the escape of blood from man or beast without any sort of manipulation, without personal contact, and even at a distance. Belief in this power is now obsolete in the Isles, but is still common in Caithness and Sutherland and the mainland of Ross and Inverness-shire. The accounts of such cures and the runes now given are but a few of many which the writer gathered in these districts. It was always emphasised that the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> must be performed with faith and earnestness, by one of upright life and pure heart. Those who perform it are following the example of Christ, as are those who cure mote in the eye, consumption, burst vein, and other ailments. The <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> is without effect on an unbaptized person, nor has it any effect if the performer should take food or drink, even a mouthful of water, without giving thanks. Most of those who perform the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> use a plant, usually the <gai>‘cearban-feòir’<eng> or <gai>‘cearbanach’<eng> crowfoot, sometimes some other plant; one informant said that he covered the plant with his bonnet while uttering the rune; but the opinion was expressed that the plant was not an essential part of the cure. Like the other occult powers, this power is transmitted from man to woman and from woman to man, with few exceptions. A narrator in Inverness-shire was under a promise to transmit the power to none but his daughter; she, however, refused to have it. He himself had learned it from a woman long ago; the woman told it to a <gai>‘fòd mòna,’<eng> clod of peat, upon her floor, and he took up the <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> as she sang it through, a long and obscure rune. Some of the runes are prefaced by the Lord’s Prayer, others by the Apostles’ Creed.


The writer overtook a man on the highroad from Strath Carron to Ardgay, Ross. The man seemed to be a crofter. He was well clad, well mannered and well informed, but I omitted to ask his name. He said:—

A man mending horse-harness drove the needle right through the palm of his hand. A woman present withdrew the needle. The blood spirted out against the opposite wall of the room. The woman pointed the needle towards the floor of the room, saying—

The woman had hardly uttered these words, with evident earnestness, when the bleeding suddenly stopped. All present were awe-stricken. The scene was striking and solemn. I immediately remembered the words of Christ, ‘Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do’; and again, ‘If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed.’

<eng>Mrs Mackenzie, Bail Eóghain, Kiltearn, Ross, said: When a girl of twelve or fourteen I was subject to profuse bleeding at the nose. Hitherto my mother had been able to control this bleeding, but on this occasion she failed, and I was thought to be bleeding to death. My mother hurried me away to the house of Alexander Maclennan. When we entered the house Mr Maclennan asked my name. He offered up a short rhythmical prayer, and suddenly the blood stopped. There was no personal contact—Mr Maclennan was on the other side of the room. Mr Maclennan was a highly excellent man and well known through the district for his power of stopping blood. I have seen many wonderful things done in London hospitals by skill and science; but this was a miracle obtained through prayer.


John Cameron, aged 76, shoemaker, Alness, Ross, said (27th November 1905): I got the <gai>‘eòlas,’<eng> knowledge of how to cure, from Hector Munro, the horse-doctor here. I wished to have it in order to do good to my fellow-men. Many times in my long life I have stopped bleeding in men and women, boys and girls. One fast-day a man came running up from the distillery crying, <gai>‘Chaidh an làmh bho’n uilinn a thoir dhe mhac Iain Hall. Tha e tràghadh le fuil, agus chuireadh mis a nìos a dh’iarraidh oirbhse a bhith cho math agus stad a chur air an fhuil.’<eng>—‘John Hall’s son’s arm has been torn off at the elbow. He is ebbing of blood, and I have been sent up to ask you to be so good as to check the blood.’ I performed the charm on the spot, and told the man to go back and see whether the blood had stopped. He went, and returned, and told me that the blood had stopped. Then I went down, and we put lint on the arm, and the arm healed.

The same man said: John Stewart was bleeding to death, and a man came to ask me to stop the bleeding. I ran for the doctor. The doctor came and treated the man, but without effect,—the blood came pouring out as before. The doctor then said to me, ‘I can do no more, Cameron, stop you the blood.’ But I said, ‘Neither you nor I can save him, for he is ebbed of blood.’ The man died almost at once.

John Cameron described his <gai>‘eòlas’<eng> thus:—I lift a little water in a small basin, and say slowly and solemnly,

<gai>An ainm Dhé,

Nurse A. B., in the house of Thomas Ross, Rosehall, Sutherland, 14th November 1908, said: The case (one of childbirth) was tedious and difficult. I could do nothing by myself,—I was waiting for the doctor, and very anxious the while. The patient’s mother filled a small basin with water, and into this water she put a number of rings and brooches of gold and silver, which she stirred about in the basin. She then held the basin to her dying daughter’s lips, and made her drink three mouthfuls of the water, each mouthful in the name of Father, of Son, and of Spirit, the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity (<gai>‘Trì Pearsa na Trianaid chaoimh chumhachdaich’<eng>). Soon after that the child came. Then the doctor came, and soon all was well. But the child was born before the arrival of the doctor, and the birth was as gentle and as easy as any I have ever seen. How the trinkets in the water could affect the case I do not pretend to know, but that some occult power was at work in the whole matter I am certain. <gai>‘Is iomadh uair a chuala mi mu dheighinn nam fàinneachan agus nam bràisteachan agus nam prìneachan agus seudan eile dhe’n t-seòrsa sin, ach chan fhaca mi roimhe no ’na dhéidh iad ach siod, agus chuir siod fhéin iongnadh orm agus gu leòir dheth.’<eng>—I had often heard about the rings, brooches, pins and other jewels of that sort, but never before or since did I see them save in that case, and that case itself caused me wonder and in plenty.

This nurse was an active capable woman with a good professional reputation in her district. [It is to be understood that the trouble was hæmorrhage.]

BÓ FIONN

<eng>From Isabel MacEachainn, cottar, Bunessan, Mull

THE reciter was learned in folklore, traditional songs and hymns, charms and incantations, and stories and traditions of her native island. At first she was reticent, but by degrees reciter and writer became friends. At parting she said that when I came again she would give me all the lore she had, which she admitted would take me many days to write down. A few weeks thereafter Isabel MacEachainn died, and with her died volumes of valuable tradition and folklore.


Isabel MacEachainn said that a widow woman at Tabal, Mull, had a cow ill with the <gai>‘tarbhan,’<eng> swelling from surfeit, and she was wringing her hands and beating her breast to see her beloved cow in pain. At that moment she saw Calum Cille, Columba, and his twelve disciples in their <gai>‘curachan,’<eng> little boat or coracle, rowing home to Iona. The widow<gai>

Calum Cille never turned a dull ear to the poor, to the penitent, to the distressed, and he came ashore and made the <gai>‘òra’<eng> to the white cow, and the white cow rose upon her feet and shook herself and began to browse upon the green grass before her. ‘Go thou home, <gai>“brònag,”<eng> and have faith in the God who made thee and in Christ the Saviour who loved thee and died for thee, and in thine own self, and all will go well with thee and with thy cow.’ Having said this, Calum Cille rejoined his followers in the <gai>‘curach’<eng> and resumed his journey to Hì. ‘There was no one like Calum Cille, no one, my dear. He was big and handsome and eloquent, haughty to the over-haughty and humble to the humble, kind, kind to the weak and the wounded,’ (<gai>‘uaibhreach ris an an-uaibhreach, iriosal ris an iriosal, caomh caomh ris an lag agus ris an leòinte’).

Bha i uairean ri a faicinn a’ falbh fo’n a chraiceann. Dh’innis fear dhomh gun tug e a’ bhéist a mach as a shliasaid leis an sgian. B’e sin am fiollan fionn. Bha an duine so ’na éildear anns an Eaglais Shaoir, ach cha bheò e o chionn trì bliadhna fichead. Chan fhaca mise an ortha riamh air a cleachdadh, ach chuala mi gu robh muinntir eile a’ creidsinn gu làidir ann.

BINNEACH NAM BEANN

<eng>THE subject of this poem is variously known as <gai>‘Fionnghal nam Fiadh,’<eng> Flora of the Deer; <gai>‘Sorch an Òr-fhuilt,’<eng> Clara of the Golden Hair; <gai>‘Binneach nam Beann,’<eng> the Melodious One (or the Crazed One) of the Mountains, and by other names. I have taken down several versions, in South Uist and elsewhere.

The girl was young and beautiful, <gai>‘nighean dhuin uasail,’<eng> the daughter of a gentleman, but poor. She had many who admired her, but she gave the love of her heart and the devotion of her being to one alone. The mother of this young man, however, interfered, and pressed her son to marry another, a girl of wealth. In urging this upon him his mother said:

<gai>A mhic, tha an uailse ’na h-eire throm
Air an fhonn nach fhaighear an nì.<eng>

Son, gentility is a heavy burden
On the land where the kine are not.

To this the son answered:

<gai>A mhàthair, far am faighear an crodh
Chan fhaighear am modh leis a’ mhnì.<eng>

Mother, where the cattle are got
Good manners are not got with the wife.

Many-tongued rumour said that in deference to his mother the young man was going to marry her choice. Whether he had wavered or had only appeared to waver, the proud sensitive girl resented the implied slight. She lost her reason and became wildly insane. She was bound with cords and secured in the <gai>‘cùlaist,’<eng> back-house, but broke the cords, tore off her clothing, and escaping through the window fled to the hills.

It is said that all creatures except man are partial to the insane and weak-minded. The maiden of the golden hair joined the deer in the mountains, travelling with them during the day and sleeping with them at night. She became almost as fleet of foot as the deer themselves; the people of the country were pursuing her, but in vain. If at any time she seemed to tire or falter, the deer looked round and wistfully gazing at her awaited her coming.

[TD 329]

MELODIOUS ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS

The golden hair of the girl grew so long that it covered her person like a mantle, while thick soft hair grew over her body like the soft fur of the spotted fawn, or like the soft fur of the white cub of the seal, and thus nature, ever compassionate, enabled her to withstand the summer heat and winter cold. With what food she sustained herself is not known, but it was supposed that she lived on berries and nuts in their season and possibly on hind’s milk.

By degrees all the people in pursuit of the girl retired except her lover. He said he would go to <gai>‘frìth nam fiadh,’<eng> the forest of the deer, alone, but not alone return. After many days of wandering and many nights of sleeplessness the young man returned to his <gai>‘sgairte falaich,’<eng> hiding-cleft, among the rocks; and there he found his golden-haired guest lying sound asleep,—‘white angels guarding her, my dear.’ Covering the beautiful form with the soft plaid warm from his own body, the young man waited and watched. When the girl opened her blue eyes and saw her lover, she addressed him by name and thanked him for his many kindnesses to her, not least the last. ‘I am now going to die, Iain,’ she said, ‘and you will take me down to the townland and to the home of our childhood, and lay me to sleep beside my mother and among the dust of the kindred.’ And having sung this song for the ear of her lover she died in his arms.

And the young man put all the strength of his nature and all the energy of his manhood into himself and carried the girl’s body to the homestead of the glen. After giving the poem to others the young man laid himself down and died beside the maiden. The two were buried side by side in the burial-place of the green glen of their fathers, at the foot of the blue hills of the red hen, the dun deer, the brown eagle and the white ptarmigan, and beside the clear stream of the silvery salmon that runs wailing and laughing and leaping day and night towards the heaving, mourning, everlasting sea. And from their two graves two weeping willows grew and twined round one another, stem and branch and bough. And the dusky merle and the mottled mavis sang their morning elegies and their noonday coronachs and their evening lullabies.

A CHOILICH DHUIBH

<eng>THE following poem was taken down at Baile Mhic Nìll, Barra, in June 1901. Baile Mhic Nìll, ‘MacNeill’s town,’ is the native name of the place also called Bàgh a’ Chaisteil by the natives, and rendered ‘Castlebay’ by strangers. The reciter of the poem was Isabella MacDonald, wife of Alexander MacDonald, tinker. The woman was a Stewart from Lewis, her husband from Assynt.

Some ten or twelve days after Alexander MacDonald and his wife and family came to Baile Mhic Nìll, James MacDonald, brother to Alexander, arrived with his wife and family. The meeting of the two brothers and of their two families was cordial and touching in the extreme. James MacDonald set up his tent close to that of Alexander, on the bare bleak rocky hillock, exposed to all the winds that blew. Both tents were torn and tattered, ill adapted to shelter the inmates from the wind and rain, hail and snow coming in from the cold Atlantic. The inmates themselves were no whit better, being extremely ill clad, as well as ill kempt and ill washed. Notwithstanding all this, the tinkers themselves, men and women, were tall and handsome, well featured and lithe of limb, and their children ruddy and healthy. As my wife remarked at the time, the contrast in condition between the ragged tents and clothing and the handsome healthy look of the people was striking; and the manners of the people were in full keeping with the best of their appearance. When I placed a <gai>‘duais’<eng> in the woman’s hand, she at once stood straight up and with dignity and firmness declined it, saying that it would take away the pleasure she had had in giving her old songs to the <gai>‘duin uasal.’<eng> I urged that I should feel shy of coming again if she did not accept it, but she and her husband, <gai>‘am beul a chéile,’<eng> ‘in one another’s mouth,’ said that I was welcome to come if I proffered nothing.

This has been my invariable experience of these wandering tribes of the weary feet and moving homes, driven hither and thither, from post to pillar, by county authorities and landed proprietors. A little more thought for their needs, a little more consideration for their inherited idiosyncrasies, would lead to fewer crimes, real or imaginary, laid to the charge of tinkers. I have seen many tinkers and observed their ways; I have taken down thousands of their Shelta words, hundreds of their stories and scores of their songs, and I have found them always well mannered and well behaved, much preferable to the residuum of towns, fit to compare, mentally, morally and physically, with any class of the community. Nor have I ever heard of a farmer regretting consideration shown to them.

The reciter said that the poem was composed at Garbhath Mór, in Badenoch. The composer had been confined, and lay on the <gai>‘leaba làir,’<eng> ‘floor-bed.’ Her husband had brought home a lamb from the hill

[TD 339]

to offer sacrifice for the safe delivery of his wife. Having tied the lamb’s feet he placed its neck upon a block and struck off its head with an axe and placed the lamb upon a fire on the knoll.

There were two boys in the house who keenly watched the proceedings. In imitation of their father, the elder boy placed the neck of the younger upon a block on the floor near their mother. The mother watched the boys with anxiety, but was too weak to move and too afraid to cry out, until she saw the elder boy raise the axe to his shoulder as the father had done.

She sprang from the bed, diverted the blow, but diverted it from the neck of the boy upon the block to the neck of the infant in her arms. When she saw what had occurred, her reason fled; she sprang to her feet and with lightning speed flew to the hills and joined the deer. There she grew as fleet of foot, as sharp of sight, as keen of scent and as wild of nature as the wild deer themselves.

Many efforts were made to capture the woman, but they availed nothing and were at last discontinued. When the deer came down from the heights above to the straths below, the woman was in their midst, feeding wherever they fed and moving wherever they moved. When the crofters sent their dogs to drive the deer from their corn, the woman was the first to see and to hear, the first to flee and to lead the way up the steep corries, over the deep chasms and along the narrow devious passes to the mountain summits beyond, never slipping, never tripping, never hesitating however great the speed, however difficult the way. The mother of the insane woman was persistent in hounding the deer with the dogs and in driving them from the straths to the mountains. For whenever she saw the deer and her daughter in their midst, she became possessed and acted accordingly.

By the law of the times it was permissible for the insane woman’s husband to marry again after seven years. The man was going to avail himself of this law. The day and hour of his marriage arrived, the people were in their places, and the ceremony was about to begin, when the man’s wife appeared in their midst and took her place beside her husband. All was surprise and confusion, no one knowing what to do or say. The <gai>‘pears-eaglais,’<eng> cleric, who was to perform the marriage, examined the woman, and finding her sane and sensible, dispersed the people.

The woman was well clothed and wisely spoken, but where she had obtained her clothing, not to mention her reason, no one understood. She was covered with fine fur or soft down, <gai>‘mar chuilean moineis a’ chuain no mar laogh eilid ruadh nam beann,’<eng> ‘like the cub of the grey seal of the ocean or the fawn of the red hind of the mountains.’

The poem is unequal in rhythm and irregular in measure, evidently incomplete, and difficult to translate. Although composed inland, it contains many island phrases, probably because island reciters have substituted known words for those which they did not understand. I have often found a reciter replacing an unknown word or phrase in this way.

TÀLADH AN T-SNEACHDA

<eng>THE following poem was taken down by John Macnab, student of divinity, Glen Orchy, from Pàra Mór Domhnallach, Big Peter MacDonald of Glen Coe.

The night after the massacre of Glen Coe officers and soldiers were out searching the hills and dales for any stray fugitives who might have escaped the massacre. Hearing the sound of the pipes, they followed it, thinking that this might be some MacDonald guiding his friends to safety. Eager to wreak their vengeance on the clan they hated, they followed the piping through mud and mire, swamp and stream, snow wreath and rock cleft, till they reached a distant tarn among the high mountains. Here the music sank down in the depths of the tarn and died softly away as dies the eerie sough of the western wind.

The people maintain that the piper was one of the good fairies of the mound.

Beaten and battered by the storm, with baffled rage in their hearts and curses on their lips, the soldiers returned. They heard upon the wind the screaming of a child. The officer in command called out to the nearest soldier, <gai>‘Falbh agus cuir car an amhaich an isein ud,’<eng> ‘Go and put a twist in the neck of that brat.’ As the man neared the place from which the screams were coming, <gai>‘chual e an aon cheòl bu bhòidhche chuala cluas riamh, ceòl a bu bhòidhche na beòil nam ban sìth san tom,’<eng> he heard the one most beautiful music that ever ear heard, music more beautiful<gai>


Is fuar fuar a nochd mo leaba,
Is fuar fuar a nochd mo leanabh,
Is buan buan a nochd do chadal,
Mis am anart ’s tus am achlais.

Tha sgàil a’ bhàis a’ snàgan tharam,
Cuisle bhlàth mo ghràidh cha charaich,
Gaoth nan ard do thàladh cadail,
Sneachd nam beann gu teann do bhrata.

THE LULLABY OF THE SNOW

than the lips of the fairy women in the knoll. Who was this but a young mother who had escaped the massacre, lulling her child to sleep the sleep of death amid the snow. <gai>‘Chuimhnich an saighdear air an té dh’fhàg e aig an taigh taobh an teine, agus gaolachan beag bòidheach ’na h-uchd, a’ seinn crònan ciùin cadail dha, agus fuil Chlann Domhnaill ’nam pòraibh le chéile. Agus thuit e mach gum b’e an dearbh chrònan am fìor cheòl mu dheireadh a chual e dar a dh’fhàg e a dhaoine agus a dhachaidh iomadh là is bliadhna roimhe sin, an crònan caoin ciùil a bha màthair an leinibh a’ seinn anns an t-sneachda.’<eng>—The soldier remembered her whom he had left at home beside the fire with a little beautiful beloved babe upon her breast, singing a quiet croon of sleep to him, and the blood of Clan Donald in the veins of both. And it chanced that the gentle croon of music that the child’s mother was singing in the snow was the very same music as he had last heard when he left his kin and his home many a day and year before that. The soldier wrapped the woman and her child in his plaid, gave them what food and drink he had, and left them to overtake his comrades. On the way he came upon a wolf devouring the body of a woman who had escaped alive from the scene of the massacre. He slew the wolf and showed the officer the blood upon his sword. By the mercy of God and through the soldier’s compassion mother and child survived. Descendants of the child are still living, and the tradition is current and believed throughout the districts of Appin and Lochaber.<gai>

Thàinig iad oirnne.

Gu murt agus snaoghal (?)
Thàinig iad,
Gu burral is baoghal
Thàinig iad,
Gu furradh is fadhbh,
Ri uisge ’s ri gaoith,
A thogail bà laogh
Thàinig iad oirnne.

Thàinig na Cait,
Thàinig na Cait,
Thàinig na Cait,
Thàinig na Cait,
Thàinig Cait oirnne,
Thàinig na Cait ris an an-uair,
Bhualadh iad oirnne.

Gu cur nam bà laogh,
Gu iomairt nan caor,
Gu fuil agus fraoch,
Gu gul agus gaoir,
Gu fuil agus fraoch,
A’ dul anns an Daorn,
Thàinig iad oirnne.

EÓNAGAIN! O Eónagain!
Is neònach liom do ghnìomh,
Thus air ceòraich fada bhuam,	[ceòlraich
Is mise truagh liom fhìn!

Eónagain! O Eónagain!
Is neònach liom do dhàil,
Thus an aird air bharraibh chràc,
Is mis a’ snàmh an làir!

Eónagain! O Eónagain!
Is ceòl thu fad air falbh,
Mar chrònan caoin na màthar ghaoil
An cadal caomh nam marbh.

A BHRICEIN BHALLAICH

A BHRICEIN bhallaich bhig bhòidhich,
Càite bheil òigear mo ghràidh?
A bheil e cùl nan tonn dòbhaidh,
A’ cumail comhraig ri sàir?

A bhricein bhallaich bhig bhòidhich,
Càite bheil òigear mo rùin?
A bheil e mach sa bheinn ghruamaich
Mar ri Gruagach a’ chuirn?

A bhricein bhallaich bhig bhòidhich,
Càite bheil òigear mo ghaoil?
A bheil e ’n Innis na hÒige,
Mar ri Osgar ’s Connlaoch ’s Fraoch?

A bhricein bhallaich bhig bhòidhich,
Càite bheil òigear mo luaidh?
A bheil e ’n Albainn no ’n Éirinn,
No cùl na gréine ’na shuain?

A bhricein bhallaich bhig bhòidhich,
Bheil Mac na hÒighe le m’ ghaol?
’S am faod mise mo bhròn fhàgail
San Abhainn nach tràigh san t-sao’l?
