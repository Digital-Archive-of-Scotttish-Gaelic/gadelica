An Lasair

Anthology of 18th Century Scottish Gaelic Verse

Gum b’ fhearail, smiorail, anamant’ e,
Bu lasair ’fhearg nuair dhùisgeadh e,
Bu bheò ’na fheòil ’s ’na mheanmna e,
Bu bhealach far am brùchdadh e

He was manly, active, and courageous,
His rage was a flame when it was roused,
Alive was he in his flesh and his spirit,
A gap would be where he burst through

AN LASAIR (‘The Flame’) is a colourful new anthology of over sixty poems from one of the most dynamic periods of Gaelic literature. Arranged chronologically and edited with facing translations by Ronald Black, these poems, composed in a range of forms and styles, span the whole gamut of human experience, from politics, religion and war to love, sex and domestic life. Together they form a rich celebration of Gaelic culture and provide a fascinating insight into the passions and preoccupations of the Highland people during a turbulent period of their history.

An Lasair features the work of over forty poets, and includes extensive notes and an introduction, which set the poems firmly in their literary and historical contexts. The poets include:

Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair (Alastair MacDonald)
Duncan Ban Macintyre
Sìleas na Ceapaich (Cicely MacDonald)
Rob Donn
Dugald Buchanan
Mairearad nighean Lachlainn (Margaret MacLean)
William Ross
Lachlan MacKinnon
Christiana Fergusson
John Roy Stewart
Mary MacPherson (Bean Torra Dhamh)
John MacCodrum

INTRODUCTION
[Beurla]

[TD 1]

AN LASAIR

The texts that follow are not intended to be definitive, as I have not consulted every possible source for every poem. Sources are given in the notes (pp. 363–525); most are printed (see ‘Collections’, p. 362), some are manuscript. Lack of time has prevented me making use of the substantial holdings of eighteenth-century verse in the Sound Archive of the School of Scottish Studies. Most of our poems are in fact songs and most of the tunes are known. Readers who wish to pursue the music can do so using the references given in the notes; the volumes published by the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society (SGTS) are particularly helpful, many of them containing a specific section devoted to airs and metres.

In recent years there has been some controversy about Gaelic orthography, but the actual areas of disagreement are small and marginal. The spelling used in this book represents an attempt to reconcile best academic practice as exemplified in the Rev. William Matheson’s magisterial The Blind Harper: The Songs of Roderick Morison and his Music (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1970) with best pedagogic practice as discussed in the Scottish Examination Board’s stimulating Gaelic Orthographic Conventions [GOC] (Dalkeith, 1981). In other words, like all contemporary Gaelic writers, I employ ‘GOC with variations’. The purpose of my own ‘variations’ — retention of apostrophe with ’nam, ’nad, ’na ‘in my, in your, in his’ etc., removal of apostrophe from copula forms e.g. s, se, sann, retention of two accents — is to show semantic or phonological distinctions. Where no such distinctions exist, e.g. between a, o and u in unstressed syllables, or between sd and st, I adhere strictly to GOC recommendations. Although I apply these principles in all my publications I cannot claim credit for them, as they were established in 1990 by a Gaelic Orthography Sub-Committee of the Scottish Examination Board.

The translations are my own, but I am greatly in debt to all previous translators. I have tried to be literal without being slavish, and to convey some idea of the rhythm of the original without descending into doggerel. I am conscious that I have come closer to achieving these aims with some poems than with others. Indents represent rhyme-schemes, and all translations are indented identically to originals, so although translations are seldom themselves in rhyme, the ‘ghost’ of rhyme shows through them. Gaelic rhyme is assonance. In poem 2, which is typical, there are two sorts of rhyme, end-rhyme (e.g. snàmh : ghnàth : làr : phràmh) and what is called aicill rhyme (e.g. chuaintean : bruaillean; leannain : ghalar).

1. Gort am Bràigh Athaill

Iain Lom?

’S mi am bràigh Athaill fo cheò
Far nach léir dhomh mo bhròg,
Tha mo bhreacan mar lòn air drùdhadh orm.

’S mi an taigh gun teine gun dìon,
Gun shalann gun bhiadh,
’S e gun doras gun chliath dh’a dhùnadh ris.				6

Nam biodh fios mar a thà,
Gu bheil mis’ an taigh fàs,
Nàile, dh’ibhteadh an càrt le dùrachd orm.

Cha bhiodh breunag a bh’ ann
Toirt a léine thar cheann
Bho nach éigheadh a clann dar a dhùisgeadh iad.			12

Gheibhte a shuairce gun sprochd
Air ’m bu shuarach a’ ghort
Bheireadh greis dh’a chuid phort le sùgradh dhuinn.

Nam faighinn ad’ chòir,
A sheòid laghaich gun ghò,
Cha ghabhainn mar lòn tric ùbhlan bhuat.				18

Mhic Alastair chaoil
Bho Bhaile nan Craobh,
Ceud soraidh ’s mo ghaol le dùrachd dhut.

2. Tha mo Chridhe mar Chuaintean

Sgàire MacAmhlaigh

Tha mo chridhe mar chuaintean
Air bheil mulad is bruaillean a’ snàmh,
Gur h-e trom-cheist mo leannain
Mo throm ghalar is m’ euslaint a-ghnàth:
Tha mo shùilean gu silteach,
Mo dheòir tuiteam mar uisge gu làr —
Tha leann dubh air mo bhuaireadh
Rinn mo chaidreabh thoirt bhuam ’s mo phràmh.			8

Mun rìbhinn òig àlainn,
Banrigh na h-uil’ mhnà tha fon ghréin
Ann an deasachd ’s an eòlas,
Ann an tuigse ’s am foghlam ’s an céill,
Ann an geanmnachd ’s am mialtachd,
Ann am baindeachd gun mhìorun gun eud —
Gràdh neochiontach, diamhair,
Neo-lochdach, gun ghiamh, is gun bheud.				16

Càit an do ghineadh fo fhlathas
Na dh’fhiosraich riamh mathas na mnà
Nach tug dùrachd dhi diamhair
Agus ùmhlachd dhi ’m fianaisibh chàich?
Mar ghréin misge nan reultan
Gheug sholais thar cheud fhuair bàrr —
Gur e gathan na gréine sa
Shrac mo chridhe ’s a reub e gu bàs.					24

O nach d’fhaod riamh aon duine
Eòlas iomlan na cruinne chur sìos
Ann an sgrìobhadh no ’n litir,
Nì motha ràinig tuigs’ air a thrian,
Dhòmhs’ is ladarn’ ’s is dàna
Teachd air annas na mnà ’s air a gnìomh —
Tha ’nar saoghal beag cuimir
Ann an nàdar gun choimeas ann dì.					32

[TD 5]

[TD 6]

Ge bu leam ùghdarrachd Ghalen,
Ùr-labhradh gach sgoil as ro àrd,
Bu ro bheag leam mo chomas
Air do dhèanamh-sa follais an dàn;
Ach mum pillear san àth mi
S mór gur feàrr a bhith bàitht’ air an t-snàmh,
Bhon as onair ’s nach mulad leam
Do mholadh bho d’ mhullach gu d’ shàil.				40

Dh’fhàs air rogha nan ògbhan
Cùl sgiamhach, falt còrnach nan cuach,
Ciabhach camlùbach caslach,
Sgiamhach amalagach dreachbhuidh gach dual;
Bàrr gast’ a’ chùil òrbhuidh
Mar dhreach theudan as ceòlmhoire fuaim —
B’ éibhinn fhaicinn ga réiteach
’S fiamh laiste na gréine mu d’ chluais.				48

A ghnùis aingleanta, mhìn-gheal,
Gun anntlachd gun mhìothlachd gun mhòd,
Mala chaol as glan cumadh,
Chàirich nàdar a h-uiread gun chòrr,
Rosg mall is dearc lìonta
Leis am meallar àrd rìoghraidh na h-Eòrp’,
Gruaidh chorcarra mhìn-dearg
Ghluais m’ osna fo iongnadh an t-slòigh.				56

Fuaim orghain no fìdhle,
Ceòl torghain nam pìoba ’s nan teud,
Cha do sheinneadh an sìothbhrugh
Ceòl as binne na pìoban do chléibh:
Gaoth mar lusan na frìthe
Tigh’nn bho uinneagan mìne do bhéil,
Bilean blàthbhriathrach àlainn
Aig an rìbhinn as cnàimhghile deud.					64

S ceart cho geal tha do bhràghad
Ri canach no tràth-shneachd air géig,
S corrach mìn tha na tulaichean
Dh’fhàs ’nam mulain air mullach do chléibh;

[TD 7]

[Beurla]

[TD 8]

Basan fìnealta bàna,
Meòir ghrinn-chaol ’gam b’ àbhaist cur gréis
Air seudan le òr-shnàth
Dealbh ìomhaigh gach eòin is gach géig.				72

Slios sèimh mar an canach,
Corp seudail mar eal’ air an t-snàmh,
Calpa cruinn ann an steumhan,
Troigh eutrom is cumadh air sàil;
Mar shamhail do mhòrchuis
Chan aithne dhomh ’n còrr ort ri ràdh,
Cha bheag is cha mhòr thu —
Anns gach aon nì gu leòr ort gun bhàrr.				80

Nam biodh na h-urad aig càch ort
’S a bh’ agamsa ’ghràdh air do neòil,
Cha bu ràbhart no mearachd
Leo mi labhairt mo bharail ’s mo ghlòir;
Ach nan creideadh iad fìrinn,
Cha tréiginn air mhìltean thu ’n òr
No, air airgead nan Innsean,
Do bheadradh, do dhìsleachd ’s do phòg.				88

O nach caochladh tu aigne
’S nach claonadh tu ad’ chaidreabh ’s ad’ ghaol,
’S nach fhaodainn bhith réidh riut
Mar lùdhaigeadh cléir dhuinn maraon,
B’ fheàrr leam bhith gun éirigh
Fo thalamh ann an Éipheit nan craobh
No an rìoghachd na Gréige
No ’m measg Thurcach gun fhoghlam gun chaomh.			96

Bidh mi nis a’ co-dhùnadh
Agus cuiream ri tùrsa gu bràch;
Chan eil sìothaimh ’nam aigneadh
O nach meal mi do chaidreabh ’s do ghràdh:
Bhon a thug thu làn fhuath dhomh,
Gus an téid mi san uaigh leis a’ bhàs
Bidh mo chridhe mar chuaintean
Air ’m bi mulad is bruaillean a’ snàmh.				104

3. Chunnaic Mi ’n t-Òg Uasal

Gun Urra

Hao ri rì ri rì hó,
Hó ho ro hó, hao hó.

Chunnaic mi an t-òg uasal
Seachad suas ’n-seo an-dé.

’S le ghunn’ air a ghualainn
Gura uallach a cheum.

’S ghabh e suas orm seachad
Air each glas nan ceum réidh.						8

Cha do dh’fhiosraich, cha d’ dh’fharraid,
Cha do ghabh e bhuam sgeul.

’S mun taca seo ’n-uiridh
Bu leam t’ fhuran ro cheud.

’S cha mhutha mi am-bliadhna
Seach ianlaith nan speur.

’S gu bheil sac air mo chridhe
Nach tog fidheall nan teud.						16

Trom mhulad, trom mhulad,
Trom mhulad ’nad dhéidh.

S truagh, a Rìgh, nach mi ’n gunna
Ris an cuireadh tu ’n gleus.

S truagh, a Rìgh, nach mi ’n garbhlach
Air am marbhadh tu na féidh.

S truagh, a Rìgh, nach mi ’m bàta
Ris an càireadh tu ’m bréid.						24

[TD 11]

[Beurla]

[TD 12]

S truagh, a Rìgh, nach mi ’m breacan
Thug thu dhachaigh on fhéill.

’S nuair a thilleadh on fhrasrach
Bhithinn paisgte fo d’ sgéith.

’S nuair a rachadh i fhàsgadh
Bhithinn sgaoilte ri gréin.

’S comhairl’ bheirinn air nighinn
Bhiodh a-rithist ’nam dhéidh						32

Gun i thoirt a gaol falaich
Do dhuine tha fon ghréin.

Bidh iad briathrach a’ tighinn
’S rùn an cridh’ aca fhéin.


4. Sgian Dubh an Sprogain Chaim

Lachlann mac Theàrlaich Òig

Dh’innsinn sgeul mu mhalairt duibh
Nam fanadh sibh gu fòill,
Mar dh’éirich don chall bhreamais domh
Nuair chaidh mi do Dhùn Gleòis:
Air bhith thall an Sgalpaigh dhomh
Air cuirm aig Lachann Òg,
Fhuair mi ’bhiodag thubaisteach
Le a caisein-uchd bha mòr.						8

Bu mhath a’ chuirm a bh’ ann a-sin
’S mo bheannachd-sa ’na dhéidh,
’N fhear ud duine chunnaic i
A dhì-mol i gu léir;
Ach fhuair mi fhìn bloigh biodaig ann
Nach tig an là nì feum
Is stiallaire mòr feòsaig oirr’
Mar fhear d’a seòrsa fhéin.						16

[TD 14]

Mas oil leibh an athais ud,
Gun robh i agaibh riamh —
Loinidean is omhnaichean
An còmhnaidh dhuibh bu bhiadh;
Ged dhèanadh sibh cruinneachadh
Tuilleadh is cóig ciad,
S tearc fear gun chaisein-uchd aige

Gun do labhair Màiri,
“Mo ghràdh-s’ air a’ bhoga nodha.
Do bheatha ’s do shlàinte!
Tha stàball agam fa do chomhair.
S tric a shuidh mi làmh riut
’S a sgaoil mi mo chasan romhad,

“O! Dh’eirmis iad mi le geadha.
Sann leam fhìn bu shearbh e.
Gu dearbha b’e ’n oba n-iodha.
Iain ’s e ’na chaonnaig
Mar laos-boc a’ ruith le leathad.
Fallas air mo mhaodail.
’S chan fhaodadh e leigeadh leatha.”					40

Sin dar a thuirt Mairiread,
“Tha m’ earball air gabhail teine —
’Ille, nam biodh cearb ort,
Tha dearg air cìrean mo choilich.
Nam faighinn gu mo dhearbhadh
Mo ghearra-bhod ’s mo phaidhir pheallaid
S mise bhiodh gu h-éibhinn
Nuair leumadh an acfhainn deiridh!”					48

Ach seo mar thuirt nigh’n Eóghainn.
“O bhóu! Mar tha mi fodham,
Triallaidh mi do Chromba
A shealltainn air m’ oba nodha.
Tha mo ghiullan òg ann
’S bha eòlas agam air roimhe
’S gheibh mi na seachd òirlich —

Gu m’ aois, gus am bithinn gnothaist,
Na bhith ’g éisteachd an sgéil ud —
Mar leumas iad air na mnathaibh.					8

Ged bhithinn-sa ’nam ghruagaich
Cho uallach ’s a bha mi roimhe,

Le deòin a dhèanadh mo ghnothach,

Ach gun dèan sibh còrdadh

Na h-òganaich uile sheachnadh,
Gun am fulang dàna

“Beir uam i! Chan fhaca mis’ i!”					56

Na géillibh do luchd nan gibhtean —

As feudail nach coisinn mios iad:
Ged a gheibh sibh làimhnean,
Fàinne, no deise ribean,
Is daor a nì sibh phàigheadh
Nuair dh’àrdaicheas air a’ chriosan.					64

Cha sanntaich mi dol m’a comhair
Le cùram mo phàistean
As cràidhtiche leam fon domhain.					100

’S ged a chaidh thu sa chreig ud cha b’e ’n t-eagal a leugh thu,

Nuair a thàinig do mhàthair, cha do chàirich i ’m bréid oirr’,
Nuair a thàinig do phiuthar, bha sinn dubhach le chéile,
Nuair a thàinig do bhràthair, cha do chumhainn e ’n t-éigheadh—
Bha sinn dubhach is cràidhteach gad amharc an céin uainn.
A sheachd beannachd nan càirdean, ’s a lon làidir na feuma,
Tha mo chuid-s’ de na h-eunaibh anns na neulaibh ag éigheach,

21. Crosanachd Fhir nan Druimnean

Iain mac Ailein

Tha bith ùr an tìr na Dreòllainn
As còir dhuinn aithris;
Tha móran deth tighinn am bitheant’
Ri gnàs Shasainn.

Chan eil duin’ uasal no ìosal
No fear fearainn
Leis nach àill, gu móran buinnig,
Ceàird a bharrachd.							8

[TD 105]

[Beurla]

[TD 106]

Tha ceàird ùr aig fear nan Druimnean
Ar leinn tha cronail:
B’ àill leis fhéin a dhol an àite
Mhaighstir sgoile.

An t-oide sin fhéin a rinn fhoghlam
Le glòir Laidinn —
Ghlacadh leis, gun chead a chàirdean,
A’ cheàird a bh’ aige.							16

Se an t-adhbhar a thug do dhaoine aire a thoirt do shannt an sgoileir seo, nuair a mhiannaich e a’ cheàird a bha aig oide foghlaim, nach làimhsicheadh e i mar làimhsicheadh an t-oide foghlaim fhéin i. Oir nuair a ghabhadh an t-oide foghlaim air a dhaltachan, sann a ghabhadh e air na leanabanan, ach sann a ghabhadh an sgoileir sanntach seo air na daoine àrsaidh. Agus nuair ghabhadh an t-oide foghlaim air a dhaltachan, sann a ghabhadh e air na ciontaich, ach sann a ghabhadh an sgoileir sanntach air na neochiontaich. Sann uaithe sin a dubhradh: “Saoilidh am fear a bhios ’na thàmh gur e fhéin as fheàrr làmh air an stiùir.” Ach cha mhó gur h-e.

Chan ionnsaich e clann, no leanabain,				28
Mar bu chòir dha,
Gus am bi iad ’nan daoin’ àrsaidh
Fon làn fheòsaig.

Cha tugadh an Cill Mo Cheallaig
Breith bu chlaoine
Na ’n nì rinn an ceann a b’ àirde
Am màs ga dhìoladh.							35

Gabhail de chrios an aois àrsaidh
Air màs seann-duin’ —
S fada mun ionnsaich an gnìomh sin
Ciall do theangaidh.

Ge b’e labhras ris an fhear ud
Còir no eucoir,
Gabhar air a ghiort de stràcaibh
Le crios éille.								43

[TD 107]

[Beurla]

[TD 108]

Agus b’ fhìor don duine sin. Cha d’fhuaireadh riamh rud a dh’ionnsachadh teanga droch-mhùinte bu mhiosa na gabhail air na màsan ann an adhbhar na teanga, agus an teanga thuigsinn gur h-ann ’na h-adhbhar fhéin a fhuair am màs am mór-ghleusadh sin. Mur dèanadh sin a ciall na bu mhiosa, cha dèanadh e idir na b’ fheàrr i. Uaithe sin a dubhradh: “Am fear nach ionnsaich làimh ri ghlùn, chan ionnsaich làimh ri uileann.”								51

A’ chuideachd do’m bu chòir bhith diamhair
’S a ghnàth am falach,
Cha d’fhàgadh da’n dìon bho chunnart
Sìon de dh’earradh.

Bha iad aon uair an làthair fianais
An taigh greusaich;							57
Thuirt nighean Shomhairle le ràbhart,
’S a gnàths sìobhalt’,
“S còir gum beannaich sinn gu saidhbhir
Cuid gach Crìostaidh.

“B’ fheàrr leam, ged nach eil mi maoineach
No luach gearrain,
Gum bitheadh coltas do thriùir
Gu tùrn aig Calum!”							65

Se adhbhar thug don mhnaoi bheusaich, cheart, chòir, seo a ràdh, a rùn deagh-chneasta, chum gum biodh aig a fear fhéin a leithid ’s a bhiodh aig a nàbaidhean; ’s nach sùil ghointe no lombais a bh’ aic’ air cuid a coimhearsnaich, mar bh’ aig Gillebrìde Mac an t-Saoir ann an Ruthaig an Tiridhe, a mhort an ceithir fichead cearc le aon bheum-sùla ’s a bhris long mhòr nan cùig crannag, a dh’ainneoin a càblaichean ’s a h-acraichean. Uaithe sin a dubhradh: “Sann den cheàird a’ chungaidh.”

Tha bith ùr an tìr na Dreòllainn
A thog am Baran,
Air gach aon fhear a labhras buna-chainnt
Rùsgadh feamain.							77

[TD 109]

[Beurla]

[TD 110]

Ma sgaoileas air feadh gach tìre
Am bith thog Teàrlach,
S teann ás nach feudadh ri h-ùine
E fhéin bhith pàighte.

Ma ruigeas an gearan seo Seumas,
Breitheamh sàr mhath,
Cha tog e dochair mu dheidhinn
Ach glag mór gàire.							85

Agus bha adhbhar no dhà aig an t-Siorra chòir air gàir a dhèanadh, thaobh gun d’rug timcheall-ghearradh airsan le coimhearsnachd ban-Spàinntich do thachair ris. Sann uaithe sin a dubhradh, “An duine nì teine math, dèanadh e fhéin a gharadh ris.”

’S thug Foirbisich ’nan deann-ruith
Gu seann taigh Chùil Lodair orr’.					24

Sann an-sin bha ’m fuathas
Gan ruagadh thar bhealaichean,

’S bu bheag an toirt mar thachair dhaibh.

Fo bhanna do léine,
Thall air do chùlaibh
Bhon fheadan mhùgach a’ séideadh.					16

O thoiseach an t-samhraidh
Gu deireadh an earraich,
An fhoghair ’s a’ gheamhraidh,
Bhiodh i cho molach
Ri dronnag an t-seann-bhruic.						24

Tha brù ort, a thrustair,
Mar ghuit no mar chriathar,
Tha cìochan do bhroillich
Mar sporan gun iallan;
Tha soic mar a’ mhuc ort
A thrusas na biastan —

Och a Theàrlaich òig Stiùbhairt,
Se do chùis rinn mo léireadh,
Thug thu bhuam gach nì bh’ agam
Ann an cogadh ’nad adhbhar;
Cha chrodh is cha chàirdean
Rinn mo chràdh, ach mo chéile
On là dh’fhàg e mi ’m aonar
Gun sìon san t-saoghal ach léine,
Mo rùn geal òg.							9

Có nis thogas an claidheamh
No nì a’ chathair a lìonadh

O nach maireann mo chiadghràdh;
Ach ciamar gheibhinn o m’ nàdar
A bhith ’g àicheadh nas miann leam
Is mo thogradh cho làidir
Bhith cur an àite mo rìgh mhath
Mo rùn geal òg?							18

Bu tu ’m fear slinneanach, leathann,
Bu chaoile meadhain ’s bu dealbhaich:
Cha bu tàillear gun eòlas
Dhèanadh còta math geàrr dhut
No dhèanadh dhut triubhas
Gun bhith cumhang, no gann dhut —
Mar ghealbhradain do chosan
Le d’ gheàrr-osan mu d’ chalpa,
Mo rùn geal òg.							27

Ás do làimh bu mhór m’ earbsa —
Gur tric a mharbh thu le chéil’ iad,
Mo rùn geal òg.							45

Bu tu pòiteir na dibhe
’N àm suidhe ’s taigh òsta —
Ge b’e dh’òladh, s tu phàigheadh

Bhith air mhisg chan e b’ fhiù leat,

Air cùl do mhnà pòsta,

Gura mis’ th’ air mo sgaradh,
’S ged a chanam, cha bhreug e:
Chaidh mo shùgradh gu sileadh
O nach pillear bhon eug thu;
Fear do chéille ’s do thuigse
Cha robh furast’ r’a fheutainn —
’S cha do sheas an Cùil Lodair
Fear do choltais bu tréine,
Mo rùn geal òg.							81

S ioma baintighearna phrìseil
Le’n sìoda ’s le’n sròltaibh
Da’n robh mise ’m chùis fharmaid
Chionns gun tairgeadh tu pòg dhomh;
Ged a bhithinn cho sealbhmhor
’S gum bu leam airgead Hanòbhair,
Bheirinn cnac anns na h-àithntean
Nan cumadh càch bhuam do phògan,
Mo rùn geal òg.							90

S iomadh bean a bha brònach
Eadar Tròndairnis is Sléibhte,
S iomadh té bha ’na bantraich
Nach d’fhuair samhla do m’ chéile;
Bha mise làn sòlais
Fhads bu bheò sinn le chéile,
Ach a-nis on a dh’fhalbh thu
Cha chùis fharmaid mi fhéin daibh,

Ach bheirinn-sa bòid nach pòsainn beadagan
A bhleitheadh a bhrà ’s a dhèanadh an greadan,

Is éibhinn ri éisteachd mo sgeòil.

Bha deàrrsadh le teas a’ cur smùid
Á bruachannan molach fraoich
’S bha deàlradh nan gathannan blàth
Cur sgèimh air cùirnean nam braon.					8

’N àm sgapadh do dhùbhlachd a’ cheò —
Na paidirean air an fheur
Mar leugan fo sgèimh an òir.

Bha abhainn a’ ruith troimh ghleann
De dh’fhìor fhìon-uisge nan àrd;

Bha maghannan mìlteach feòir
Bu mheilbheagach dhìtheanach blàth
Air gach taobh dhen uisge chruaidh
Bu luath mu thuath a’ ruith balbh.

Bha neòinein is sòbhrach gu dlùth,
Creamh agus biolair a’ fàs
Air àileanaibh aimhréidh ’s air lòin
Far ’m bu lìonmhoire ròs geal is dearg.				24

Bu cheòlmhor ceileireach eòin
Air ghriananan eireachdail àrd’
A’ freagradh a-chéile gu grinn —
Chan fhaighte an cùirt rìgh na b’ fheàrr.

Chunnaic mi, ’n uaigneas leis fhéin,
Ag éisteachd ri torghan nan eun,
Ar leam, den chruthaigheachd bheò,
An aon duin’ òg a b’ àillidh sgèimh.					32

O nach robh de dh’fhearaibh chàich
Ach esan is mi fhéin sa ghleann,
Smuaintich mi gun gabhainn sgeul
Có e fhéin, nam faighinn deth cainnt.

Thàinig e gu tostach mall
Gu foidhidneach foistinneach ciùin.

Thàinig na sluaigh sin gu tìr
’S cha b’ uaigneach an gluasad o thràigh —

A’ gluasad air chrith nam beann àrd’.					56

Chuala mi coileach ’s e gairm
’S e bualadh a sgiathan gu cruaidh,
’S thuirt an duine math sin rium:
“Cluinn Coileach na h-Àirde Tuath!”

Chunnaic mi tighinn air thùs
Stiùbhartaich, cinneadh an rìgh,
’Nam bòcanan gioraig san leirg
A dhearg an airm le fuil san t-srì.					64

Thàinig Clann Dòmhnaill ’nan déidh
Mar chonaibh confach gun bhiadh,
’Nam beithrichean guineach geur
An guaillean a-chéile gu gnìomh.

B’ àlainn dealbhach am bréid sròil
Air a cheangal ri crann caol,

Làmh dhearg, iolair, is craobh.					72

Ceangailt’ am bàrr a’ chroinn chaoil:
Bha sin ann, is leóghann dearg —
’S cha b’ àite tearmainn a chraos.

Thàirrneadh na slòigh air sliabh Fiobha
An coinneamh ri cath a chur;

Trì leóghainn a b’ fharsainge craois;
Thug iad trì sgairtean cho àrd
’S gun sgàin creagan aig meud an glaodh.

Bha leóghann diubh sin air Creig Ghuirm
Dha’m b’ ainm Iain Mùideartach òg
On Chaisteal Thiream ’s o Bhorgh
De shliochd nan Collaidh bu bhorb colg.				112

Fuaradh-frois’ oirr’.							233

Thog iad na siùil bhreaca
Bhaidealacha dhìonach,
Shìn iad na coilpeinean raga
Teanna rìghne
Ri fiodhannan àrda fada
Nan colg bìth-dhearg.							239

Cheangladh iad gu gramail snaompach,
Gu neo-chearbach
Troimh shùilean nan cromag iarainn
’S nan cruinn fhailbheag.

Ealamh dòigheil,
’S shuidh gach fear gu freastal tapaidh
’Bhuill bu chòir dha.							247

Lachlann Mac a’ Phearsain

S iomadh truaigh’ a tha cumail fodha
An tuathanaich as fheàrr air domhan —
Air meud a bhuana ’s a threabhaidh
S lìonmhor tuarastal ’na dheaghaidh.

Òl agus ceòl agus féill,
Baisteadh is pòsadh is eug,
Rìgh agus eaglais is léigh
’S mìle rud beag as a dhéidh.						8

Madadh is mèirleach is aoigh,
Famh agus earchall is dàimh,
Maighstir, muinntearas, clainn —
Feuch gun cunnt thu air a’ mhnaoi.

Chan urrainn mi ’n innse gu léir
Ach stadaidh mi aig aon éisg —
Si luch phrabach a’ bheòil ghéir
’M pòr as bradaiche fon ghréin.					16

Tha ’n saoghal air dol ás a sheòl
’S gach beathach as dona gu leòm
Nuair bhiodh luch phrabach nam fròg
A’ comaidh ris gach òlach còir.

Ciamar thug iad spéis do phòit,
Biastan gun airgead gun òr
A dh’òladh an sinnsear an lòn
Ged bhiodh an rìgh aig a’ bhòrd?					24

Fear Dhail na Ceàrdaich seo thall,
Thug iad a thaigh thar a cheann,
Gach gleus as uaisle a th’ ann —
Am fìon, a’ bheòir, is an dram.

Na biodh biadh, no deoch, no snàth,
Lìon-anairt no plaide bhàn,
Anns nach feuch sibh meud bhur càil.				56

Ithibh is òlaibh is gearraibh
Gach aodach, gach brògan ’s gach anart;

Ag itheadh a feòla ’s a saille.						45

Mise ’n-seo ’nam ònaran
’S mi còmhnaidh anns na bàghannan,
Aodaichean air chòrn agam
’S cha chum iad deò dhen àile dhiom;
Gun do rug an samhradh orm
Le gealltanas nan tàilleirean
’S gun aonan anns an dùthaich
Aig a bheil ri chunntais fàrdan orm.					8

Saoil sib’ fhéin nach neònach e,
An leòm a tha sna tàilleirean,
Mas ann o fhuil nam Mìlidh
Thàinig tinnsgealadh an àrdain ud?
Cha bhi crodh air buailidh ac’,
Cha bhi uallach àitich orr’ —
Ach ciotag mhosach, phròiseil,
’S gura dòlam air a sàilibh iad.					16

Càit am faic sibh òganaich
Cho spòrsail ris na tàilleirean?
Faire faire có bhiodh ann
Nam fóghnadh dannsa ’s gàireachdaich!
Ma bheireas dragh no trìleach orra,
Drip le mnaoi no pàistean,
Sann a chithear feadh na tìre iad
’Nan aoigheachdaich ’s ’nan ànrachdaich.				24

Am b’ aithne dhuibh mac-samhail
Do na mnathan aig na tàilleirean?
Nuair dh’éireas iad sa mhadainn

A h-uile sìon de’n riatanas
Ga iarraidh air na nàbaidhean,

“Se meud do gheall air òstairean

Nach fhaic thu fhéin bean òg agam
Nach leig dh’a deòin air fàthchul mi,
’S ged dh’fhalbhainn-sa cha choisichinn,
’S cha bhithinn a-nochd an Càirinis.”					56

Labhair mi ri Mac a’ Phiocair
E dhèanamh iochd is càirdeas rium:
“B’ eòl dhomh agus b’ aithne dhomh
Thaobh athar agus màthar thu,
’S cha ruig thu leas bhith smaointeachadh

Chaill fuil an dàil nan Stiùbhartach —
’Nan cadal trom sna h-àraichean

Mar ealtainn fon fheur uain’ e
Gu’n geàrrta sluagh san aimhreit leis.					48

Cha bu bhrais gun reusan e,
’S cha mhó bu leumach gòrach e,

’S làmh eile treun sa chòmhraig aig’;
Bha truas is iochd ri feumaich ann
’S b’i sìth is réit’ a b’ òrdugh dha,
’S chan fhaca mis’ le m’ léirsinn-sa
No neach fon ghréin ri fòirneart e.					56

’S chan iarradh iad mar bhuachaillean
San taobh tuath orr’ ach na fàsaichean.				80

’S có chaisgeas làmh na h-eucorach?

Far am faicte féidh air bearraidh,
Coileach dubh air bhàrr gach meangain.
Ailein duinn, a mhiann nan leannan,

Air a’ bhàta chrìon dhubh dharaich;
Mas fìor sin, cha bhi mi fallain —
O, a-chaoidh cha dian mi bainis.

No tainead mo bhuaile spréidheadh
Ach an fhlichead tha ad’ léinidh
’S tu air bàrr nan stuagh ag éirigh
’S mucan mara ga do reubadh.

Ge b’e sgeir no bogh’ an tàmh thu,

Nach tug mi dh’athair no mhàthair,
’S nach tug mi phiuthair no bhràthair,				36

Nar dhìoladh Dia siud air t’ anam —
Na fhuair mi dhe d’ shùgradh falaich,

Pìosan daora caol’ an anairt,
’S nèapaigear dhen t-sìoda bhallach
’S ribin gus mo ghruag a cheangal.

Chan ann de dh’uisge, no de shàile,					45

A dh’fhuil do chuim, do chléibh ’s do bhràghad,
A dh’fhuil do chuim, ’s tu ’n déis do bhàthadh.
M’ iarratas air Rìgh na Cathrach
Gun mo chur an ùir no ’n gaineamh
No an talamh toll no ’n àite falaich
Ach sa bhall am bheil thus’, Ailein,
Ged a b’ann san liadhaig fheamann
No am broinn na muice mara.						54

Do rìoghachd nach eòl duibh

Gun iochd annt’ ri truaghain,

Nach buin sibh don talamh,
’S ged dh’fhàg iad sibh falamh
Chan fhaic iad mar chall e:						120
Chaill iad an sealladh
Air gach reachd agus gealladh

Thug am fearann s’ on nàmhaid —
Ach innseadh iad dhòmhsa
Nuair théid sibh air fògradh
Mur caill iad an còir air
Gun dòigh air a theàrnadh.						128

Tìr a’ phailtis, tìr gun ghainne,
Tìr as glaine fialachd,
An tìr bhainneach, uachdrach, mhealach,
Chaomhach, channach, thìorail,
Tìr an arain, tìr an tacair,
Sìthne ’s pailteas iasgaich.						40

Tìr an àigh i, tìr nan àrmann,
Tìr nan sàr-fhear gleusta,

An tìr bhòrcach, nam frìth ròmhor,
Tìr gun leòn, gun ghéibhinn,
An tìr bhraonach mhachrach raonach,

Gu’n stad i sa Bhràighe.						56

Ged tha mi ’n tùbh sa sann tha mo rùn

Gu seòmar bàn nam pìosan —
Bidh ceòl nam feadan ’s Eòin da spreigeadh
Gu beagadh ur mì-ghean.						64

Tha mise fo mhulad san àm,
Chan òlar leam dram le sunnd,
Tha durrag air ghur ann am’ chàil
A dh’fhiosraich do chàch mo rùn;
Chan fhaic mi dol seachad air sràid
An cailin bu tlàithe sùil —
Se sin a leag m’ aigne gu làr
Mar dhuilleach o bhàrr nan craobh.					8

A ghruagach as bachlaiche cùl,
Tha mise gad iunndrainn mòr:
Ma thagh thu deagh àite dhut fhéin,
Mo bheannachd gach ré dha d’ chòir;
Tha mise ri osnaich ’nad dhéidh
Mar ghaisgeach an déis a leòn
’Na laighe san àraich gun fheum
’S nach téid anns an t-sreup nas mò.					16

Se dh’fhàg mi mar iudmhail air treud,
Mar fhear nach toir spéis do mhnaoi,
Do thuras thar chuan fo bhréid
Thug bras-shileadh dheur o m’ shùil;
B’ fheàrr nach mothaichinn fhéin
Do mhaise, do chéill, ’s do chliù,
No suairceas milis do bhéil

Cuid do sgrìobadh le aing
’S do dhèanadh mìn mar an cathadh
Le dìon-chaitheamh nan lann.						40

NOTES ON THE POEMS

1. Gort am Bràigh Athaill

The title and interpretation of this poem are my own. I see it as a rare glimpse in Gaelic verse of the poorest of the poor, as an urgent hint to a chief that starvation has struck his people, and as a request to him to send some food in the shape of apples from his garden, there being no food and no salt in the house where the poet is benighted. The woman of the fourth verse is wraithlike yet graphically portrayed, and her children have reached that advanced stage of malnutrition which is symptomised by helpless inactivity.

I take my text from Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, General Robertson’s Gaelic Manuscript (Aberdeen, 1997), pp. 21–22, 31–33. The manuscript (MS 14/80/1 in the Perth and Kinross Council Archive, A. K. Bell Library, Perth) is a collection of poetry, letters and other papers which belonged to General William Robertson of Lude (c. 1759 – 1820). The hand that wrote this particular poem is unidentified. General Robertson added the heading: “Fragment of a song by John Lomb – concludg in praise of Lude – from Ballinagrew – recd while commanding the Highland Brigade at Weeley 1809.” Weeley is a barracks near Colchester in England.

Robertson’s attribution of the fragment to the famous Keppoch poet Iain Lom (c. 1625 – post 1707), for whom see Annie M. Mackenzie (ed.), Òrain Iain Luim (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1964), is perhaps to be discounted, but it is certainly in his style. Ó Baoill and MacAulay suggest very plausibly that it is addressed to John Robertson, 11th of Lude, who succeeded his father Alexander in 1673 and died in 1731. He was the last Laird of Lude who was able to play the harp. The family’s two ancient harps were lent by General Robertson to the Highland Society of Scotland in 1805, and are now in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh.

Taking lines 4–8 as a reference, actual or figurative, to the misfortunes of the Lude estate following the family’s participation in the ’15 rising, Ó Baoill and MacAulay tentatively date the fragment c. 1716. It may equally be argued however that it dates from one of the years of John’s chiefship in which famine appears to have been widespread. These are 1673–76, 1685, 1688–89, and 1693–1700; after that there were none until 1740, by which time John was dead. Stories in Argyll about Bliadhna nan Athallach, ‘the Year of the Athollmen’, when Campbell fortunes were low and the Stewarts and Robertsons of Atholl seized the opportunity to descend upon them, seem to refer to 1685 and 1689.

[TD 364]

5 The manuscript reading is shelan or perhaps shelair, so, as Ó Baoill and MacAulay point out (p. 32), a possible alternative reading is Gun seileir gun bhiadh, ‘Without cellar [i.e. drink] or food’.

2. Tha mo Chridhe mar Chuaintean

Zachary MacAulay (c. 1667 – c. 1737), known in his day as Maighstir Sgàire, was a son of Murdo MacAulay, tacksman of Valtos, Uig, Lewis (Murchadh mac Aonghais mhic Dhòmhnaill Chaim). Graduating from Edinburgh University on 12 April 1687, he was licensed for the ministry, and is on record as a preacher and schoolmaster in Stornoway in 1689. He is said to have been prevented from pursuing his ecclesiastical career by a charge of fornication, and by 1706 he appears merely as a schoolmaster in Stornoway.

He then took up a career as a merchant. He seems to have been involved by 1710 in collecting the vicarage teinds for the island. By about 1714 he was also tide-waiter in Stornoway, responsible for collecting customs and other dues from vessels entering port. In 1716, following the rebellion which was so disastrous for the Seaforth estate, he accepted from the Commissioners of the Forfeited Estates the politically sensitive post of chamberlain (factor) of Lewis, which he succeeded in holding for the rest of his life. The rent roll of 1718 shows him holding ‘the Garcroy’ (an Gearraidh Cruaidh, where Lews Castle College now stands) for £5 11s 1 1/3d sterling; a small possession in Stornoway for £0 8s 4d sterling; the mill of Stornoway for £1 2s 2 2/3d sterling; and the fishing of a small river, obviously the Creed, for one barrel of salmon. In the same year, according to Donald Macdonald, Lewis: A History of the Island (Edinburgh, 1978), p. 125, he reported to the Commissioners that ‘the Hag, poverty was always present’ – a reference to the cailleach in her role as the spirit of winter and of hunger, see poem 61, note on lines 165–68.

The Commissioners’ records for 1726 show Zachary MacAulay still in the Gearraidh Cruaidh. He also had a tack of the township of Stornoway at £80 Scots. MacKenzie of Gruinard (for whom see poem 5) bid £100 Scots for it, however, ‘at which rent it continued’. By 1730 our poet was so infirm that Alexander MacKenzie of Achilty was called in to become joint chamberlain.

MacAulay must have inherited his poetic gifts from his mother Elizabeth (Beasa), daughter of Ewen, son of Farquhar Beaton of Husabost, Skye, a member of a celebrated family of hereditary physicians, for whom see John Bannerman, The Beatons (Edinburgh, 1986), pp. 56–57, 64–65. Elizabeth had composed an elegy to her eldest son John, who was drowned in Loch Langavat. It survives in the MacLagan MSS and is printed at pp. 484–85 of Mac Iain, ‘Iain Ruadh Mac

[TD 365]

Dhughail. (John Roy Macaulay, the famous hunter)’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 2 (1876–77), pp. 478–85: 484–85.

The above biographical information is compiled from Rev. William Matheson, The Blind Harper (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1970), p. 204, and Dr Donald Macdonald of Gisla, Tales and Traditions of the Lews (2nd edn, Edinburgh, [2000]), pp. 34–35. The only other poem of MacAulay’s known to survive is his ‘Iorram na Truaighe’ (‘The Oar-Song of Sympathy’), an elegy to the Laird of Kildun, for whom see poem 22, note on line 150. Says John Mackenzie (SO 392):

This Tighearna Chill-Duinn, was a gentleman of literary and poetical taste; he was a relative and great companion of our author. It is said that Macaulay grew melancholy after his death, though in his youth he was somewhat loose, and wrote some wanton pieces, clever enough in their way. The most celebrated of these was the “Gliogram-chas,” the air of which was a favourite with Burns, as appears from one of his letters to Thomson.


In printing ‘Tha mo Chridhe mar Chuaintean’ (SO 392) Mackenzie reduces it by judicious editing from thirteen stanzas to eight, so producing a perfect love-song. My interest in it was first aroused many years ago by the influence which it clearly had on William Ross (see poems 55, 57), whose ‘Òran anns am bheil am Bàrd a’ Moladh a Leannain agus a Dhùthcha Fhéin’ (‘A Song in which the Poet Praises his Sweetheart and his Own Land’, SO 287–88) includes the lines:

<gai>
Tha mo chridhe mar na cuaintean,
Mar dhuilleach nan crann le luasgan
No mar fhiadh an àird nam fuar-bheann,
’S mo chadal luaineach le faire.
<eng>

(“My heart is like the oceans, / Like the leaves of the trees with shaking / Or like a deer in the heights of the cold hills, / And my sleep is fitful from watching.”) Our poem was first published in the Eigg collection (1776), pp. 220–23. I take my basic text from SO 392, but as I have doubts about the legitimacy of Mackenzie’s editing practices (no matter the perfection of the product), I restore the missing stanzas (the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th and 12th). A version taken from Eigg will be found in the Menzies collection of 1870, pp. 165–68; Maclean Sinclair’s text in The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), pp. 122–25, offers some minor variants. For other sources see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 5. John Mackenzie names the tune as that of ‘Tha mo Leannan air Fàs rium an Gruaim’.

33 Ghalen is the reading in Eigg. Aicill rhyme, quite acceptably, is with sgoil. Galen (AD c. 131 – c. 201) was a Greek physician whose name carried enormous intellectual clout for 1,500 years as the supreme authority in medicine, and in view of

[TD 366]

MacAulay’s descent from the Beaton physicians (who revered Galen), this is likely to be the correct reading. Later editions emend Ghalen to Ailein, presumably referring to Allan Ramsay (1686–1758), the doyen of Lowland literary revival. He is given the same kind of pre-eminence in Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s ‘Mìomholadh Mòraig’ (Ais-Eiridh, 1751, p. 26):

<gai>
Tàmh de d’ sgeig dhiom tràth
Neo ruigeam Ailean Bàrd
’S gach filidh ’gam bheil càs
An Dùn Éideann dhiom.
<eng>

(“Cease insulting me forthwith / Or I’ll go to Allan Bard / And every senior poet / Who takes my brief in Edinburgh.”) His location in the capital, with access to printing and to libraries, is what gives him his cachet. He was a wig-maker to trade. If we accept Ailein as the original reading we are going against the spirit of line 34 and also declaring that the poem was not composed before 1724, when Ramsay’s Tea-Table Miscellany first brought him to national attention. By then Zachary MacAulay was already about 57 years old. ‘Tha mo Chridhe mar Chuaintean’ could be an elderly man’s poem, but I find it much easier to see it originating in the years 1689–1706 when he was allegedly accused of fornication. The change from Ghalen to Ailein epitomises for us the emergence of Gaelic verse from a medieval into a modern atmosphere.

67 The Eigg reading S corrach fìnealt’ na tulaich (same meaning) runs more smoothly; mìn, fada (‘long, smooth’) is then used at line 69 in place of fìnealta.


3. Chunnaic Mi ’n t-Òg Uasal

Songs like this were sung communally by women while waulking (fulling) cloth, which was extremely hard work, see poem 41, lines 96–121. They were composed by the women themselves but are full of rhetorical motifs of unknown antiquity. They reflect in a vivid manner the lives and emotions of ordinary women and their relationships, or imagined relationships, with men – frequently, as here, men of higher social status than themselves. It is impossible to date traditional waulking-songs, but as they represent a very important strand running through eighteenth-century Scottish Gaelic life and literature from beginning to end, it would be a travesty to omit them. I have chosen this one because the mention of a gun at line 19 makes it unlikely that that line, at least, dates from much before 1600, and the mention of a fiddle at line 16 makes it unlikely that that line, at least, dates from much before 1700. This version of the song was recorded by Dr J. L. Campbell from Mrs Mary Morrison (‘Bean Phluim’) at Castlebay, Barra, 29

[TD 367]

December 1949, and published in his Hebridean Folksongs III: Waulking Songs from Vatersay, Barra, South Uist, Eriskay and Benbecula (Oxford, 1981), pp. 118–21. The only other version known to me is in a notebook kept by Calum Johnston and referred to by Dr Campbell as ‘C.J.’

Here, as throughout this book, I use upper-case Rìgh, ‘King’, where the word means principally ‘God’, and lower-case rìgh, ‘king’, where it means principally ‘king’. While the young man here is neither God nor king, in the girl’s subconscious he may well be both. Such ambiguity is essential to the rhetoric of love.

While I do not propose to refer systematically to prosody in these notes, it may be worth remarking here that the poem displays the normal structure of waulking songs – it is linked by end-rhyme (an-dé : cheum : réidh etc.), while each couplet is bound internally by aicill rhyme (uasal : suas, ghualainn : uallach, etc.). Falaich : dhuine (lines 33–34) is acceptable aicill, but fhàsgadh : sgaoilte (lines 29–30) is not. See note on poem 12, line 34.


4. Sgian Dubh an Sprogain Chaim

Lachlan MacKinnon (Lachlann mac Theàrlaich Òig, 1665–1734) was born in Scalpay, Skye. His father, Teàrlach Òg (who is stated in one source to have been second son of a MacKinnon chief), was tacksman of Scalpay, and his mother was Marion MacLeod of Drynoch. He spent three years at school in Nairn, where he learned to write both prose and verse in English, and is said to have made a song to the tune of ‘Auld Lang Syne’. From MacKinnon he obtained a tack of Breakish and the isle of Pabay. In 1549 Dean Monro had described Pabay as ‘ane myle lang, full of woods, gude for fisching, and for thieves to await on leill mennis geir, perteining to Mckynvin’; in another version it was ‘a maine shelter for theeives and cutthrotts’, see R. W. Munro (ed.), Monro’s Western Isles of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1961), p. 69.

About 1688 he married Flora, daughter of Campbell of Strond in Harris, who died within a year after giving birth to a daughter. Grief-stricken, he went to live in Kintail, where he got a tack of land from Seaforth. He spent four lonely years there, satirising his new neighbours and becoming increasingly unpopular. He is said to have fled across Loch Duich to an uncle in Knoydart, pursued by Kintail men whom he and his uncle defeated in pitched battle at Inverie (Rev. Donald Lamont, Strath: In Isle of Skye (Glasgow, 1913, repr. Portree, 1984), p. 115).

Coming home to Skye, he got his old farm back from MacKinnon. William Matheson (The Blind Harper: The Songs of Roderick Morison and his Music (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1970), p. lxv) describes him as a member of what he calls the ‘Talisker circle’, a group of poets and musicians who, around the last decade or so of the seventeenth century, were apparently in the habit of foregathering under the hospitable roof of John MacLeod of Talisker. In addition to our Lachlan these included

[TD 368]

Roderick Morison (the Blind Harper, c. 1656 – c. 1714), John MacKay (the Blind Piper, see poem 23), and John MacLean (Iain mac Ailein, see poems 19 and 21).

About 1705, when visiting Inverness, Lachlan was persuaded by some old school friends to marry a Macintosh widow who was said to be rich. Not only was this untrue, but on the morning after their wedding he was summoned to court for non-payment of his wife’s debts. Summons in hand, he is said to have picked up a pen, opened his wife’s Bible, and written:

<gai>
Tha ’n saoghal air a roinn,
Tha dà dhàn ann:
Tha dàn ann gu bhith sona —
Ach chì mi dàn an Donais ann.
<eng>

“The world is divided, / There are two fates in it: / One fate’s to be happy — / But I see the Devil’s fate in it.” It is worth pointing out that dàn means ‘poem’ as well as ‘fate’. See Sgiathanach (Rev. Alexander MacGregor), ‘Lachlunn Mac Theàrlaich Òig, Am Bàrd Sgiathanach’, in An Gaidheal, vol. 3 (1874), pp. 120–21 and 145–48: 146, or his English version of this in The Celtic Magazine, vol. 1 (1875–76), pp. 91–94.

Despite – or perhaps because of – the unhappiness of his second marriage, Lachlan seems to have enjoyed a privileged life, going from place to place with his fiddle and enjoying the hospitality of others on the strength of his outgoing personality and his reputation as poet, musician, storyteller, and wit. An anecdote in Gairm 9 (Am Foghar 1954), pp. 33–34, tells how he was encountered by the young Murdoch Matheson (for whom see poem 22) in the inn at Lusa between Kyleakin and Broadford. That this life of privilege came to an end well before his death is suggested by poem 8.

According to Alexander Nicolson, History of Skye (2nd edn, Bernisdale, 1994), p. 127, he had an illegitimate daughter who inherited his poetic talents and looked after him in his old age. More than half of John Mackenzie’s biographical introduction to his work in SO 80–84 consists of an unedifying story of how he once badly abused the hospitality of a farmer in Lochalsh by deflowering his daughter and murdering her pet dog; the result, claims Mackenzie, was the aforesaid ‘love-child’. As this anecdote is in striking contrast to the admiring nature of accounts of the poet from Skye sources, we may take it that it represents Kintail tradition.

At least five of Lachlan’s poems survive, and the personality that comes across from them is certainly attractive. This applies to our poem, which I take from SO 83–84. It arose from a game called iomlaid bhiodag or ‘dirk-swapping’ (for which see also poem 12, note on line 41). Mackenzie explains (SO 84):

The poet happened to be one of a party at the house of Lachunn Og, a relative of his own, when, upon the company “getting fou an’ unco

[TD 369]

happy,” they fell to playing at a sort of game called Iomlaid bhiodag. The manner in which it is played is this:— The lights are extinguished, and every man casts his dirk under the table. The dirks are then shuffled with a staff, after which a person, having his right hand tied to his side, and a glove on his left, is blindfolded and put under the table to hand out one by one in rotation to every man who had cast a dirk in: and every body had to keep the dirk which fell to him in this way. McKinnon’s dirk was by far the best in the whole collection, but he lost it in the lottery, and got in its stead an old coarse dagger belonging to a Kintail man who was present. This person was one of those termed “Clann ’Ic Rath Mholach,” i.e. Hairy McRaes. McKinnon was far from pleased with his lot, and he composed this song on the occasion.


I take it that the house in which this took place is Dùn Gleòis of line 4; whether it is a place in Scalpay, or merely an affectionate name for Lachlann Òg’s home, I do not know. It means roughly ‘the Fort of Good Trim’ or even ‘the Fort of Tuning Up’, a musical-sounding place.

The poem was first published in Turner’s collection of 1813, pp. 339–42, where it is called ‘Bhiodag Thubaisteach’ (‘The Unlucky Dirk’). SO is very similar to Turner, and the minor alterations made by Mackenzie probably represent improvements of his own making. Given its subject-matter, the song is unlikely to have been popular in Mackenzie’s native Ross-shire.

An earlier source, NLS MS 14876 (Dr Donald Smith, 1776), ff. 42v–43r, offers eighteen stanzas headed: “Oran na Biodagg. Leis an Bhard Liondalach.” This is a radically different version, consisting of nine of the twelve stanzas in Turner and SO, plus nine of Dr Smith’s own, totalling eighteen. This means that a song containing twenty-one stanzas can eventually be constructed, but as MS 14876 is difficult to decipher, I leave that task for a more suitable occasion. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 14.

I have kept the knives’ feminine gender throughout my translation, partly because the poets invariably described their weapons as female companions (Duncan Ban’s gun NicCòiseim is just one example, see my An Tuil, p. 741), and partly because I think it is essential if we are to get the full sense. There is much sexual imagery in the poem, most notably at lines 29, 53 and 77–80, and it is not impossible that it is an allegory for the poet’s two wives – the young one whom he lost, and the second one who made his life such a misery.

8 A caisein-uchd or dewlap is the fold of loose skin hanging from an animal’s throat, much to the fore in traditional New Year celebrations. A caisein-uchd was singed in the fire and passed around to be sniffed by all present for good luck in the coming year, see poem 36, note on line 3. At lines 16 and 23 it is likened to the beard of a Hairy MacRae; for how it applies to the knife see note on lines 29–32.

[TD 370]

19 The poet ascribes the MacRaes’ hairiness to their diet, presumably in contrast to clean-shaven, meat-eating MacKinnons. Martin Martin, in A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland circa 1695 (1994 edn, Edinburgh), pp. 242–43, describes how cows’ or goats’ milk is whisked up with a loinid to make omhan or milkshake, which he calles ‘oon’.

A quantity of milk or whey is boiled in a pot, and then it is wrought up to the mouth of the pot with a long stick of wood, having a cross at the lower end. It is turned about like the stick for making chocolate; and being thus made, it is supped with spoons. It is made up five or six times in the same manner, and the last is always reckoned best and the first two or three frothings the worst. The milk or whey that is in the bottom of the pot is reckoned much better in all respects than simple milk. It may be thought that such as feed after this rate are not fit for action of any kind; but I have seen several that lived upon this sort of food, made of whey only, for some months together, and yet they were able to undergo the ordinary fatigue of their employments, whether by sea or land; and I have seen them travel to the tops of high mountains as briskly as any I ever saw.

24 Turner here has Cho gharbh ri muice fiadh (‘As thick as a wild pig’), while Dr Smith gives Cho garbh ri muic air sliabh, ‘As thick as a pig on a hill’; muic might be thought to rhyme better with uchd than does torc, but in fact traditional verse allowed considerable licence with regard to rhyme (especially aicill rhyme) between short syllables.

29–32 The knife has a handle consisting of a huge lump of willow, broad enough to turn into the crosg or business end of a whisk. Lachlan is, it seems, accusing MacRae of holding his knife by the blade and using the handle to whisk up his whey. That is why it is white and disgusting. Willow is full of tough fibres which go into strands like a beard when they get damp.

33–36 The mode becomes mock-heroic as the poet gives one stanza to the dirk he has lost. Clearly it was won in the game by a man from the narrows of Loch Arkaig in northern Lochaber. MacFhionghain, the MacKinnon chief, appears to be depicted as sending ‘the seven warrants’ to a MacPhee of Glendessary (at the head of Loch Arkaig), the tribe traditionally entrusted by Cameron of Lochiel with guarding the northern marches of his territory, see John Stewart of Ardvorlich, The Camerons (2nd edn, Glasgow, 1981), p. 188. It may be speculated that ‘the seven warrants’ were applied in cases of desertion.

37 NLS MS 14876 here has Caol Àcainn (Kyleakin), which is within MacKinnon’s own territory.

41, 48 The ‘cravat’ must refer to the wedge-shape of the willow handle, the ‘narrow throat’ to the spindliness of the blade where it enters the haft.

[TD 371]

59–64 The poet depicts himself confronting MacRae, who promptly sticks into the table a revolting object from Morar which was his own prize from the game.

65 MacRae launches into an indignant defence of the knife which Lachlan had won from him. ‘A’ Bhruighean Chaorthainn’ (‘The Enchanted Rowan-Tree Hall’) was one of the most popular of the Fenian tales. For a large part of it Fionn and most of the Féinn are stuck by their bottoms to the floor of the Hall, but after being released by the application of a magic liquid, a great battle with the men of Lochlann takes place in which they are victorious. This will be ‘the battle of the giants’. Probably the service claimed by MacRae to have been performed by his knife within the hall was prising Fionn cleanly off the floor. Conan Maol (for whom see poem 17, lines 57–60) was not so lucky, and left the skin of his behind behind – hence, at least according to Scottish versions of the tale, his epithet. See Alan Bruford, Gaelic Folk-Tales and Mediæval Romances (Dublin, 1969), pp. 3–4, 115–16.

76 The word maol means ‘blunt’, ‘bald’, sometimes ‘infertile’.

77–80 I take this to mean that the knife was so stuck in its sheath that Lachlan had to kneel on the floor to pull it out. It is a relief to find out that some of these knives were sheathed; the fact that the blindfold man in the game wore a glove suggests that this could not be depended on. Line 77 also has sexual connotations, however; cf. Duncan Ban Macintyre’s satire on Donald MacNicol (for whom see poem 17) in Angus MacLeod (ed.), The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952), p. 88:

<gai>
Le chriotachadh tèarainte, rùnach,
’S e dlùthachadh rithe gu dàna,
’S ma chaidh e san àm air a ghlùinibh
Cha b’ann ris na h-ùrnaighean bhà e.
<eng>

(“With his guarded, deliberate fondling, / He boldly drew close to her, / And if he knelt down in the meantime / It wasn’t to say his prayers.”)

89–96 Having lost the argument with MacRae, all the poet can do is end with a generic dig at his tribe.

95–96 Turner here has: S tearc fear gun chaisein uchd g’a chìochan air / Gu ruig giall a chluas – ‘Scarce one lacks a dewlap to his nipple (or ‘to his breasts’) / As far as the jaws of his ears’. It is clearly hypermetric, and if Turner recorded it correctly (which Mackenzie obviously doubted), the intention was to bring the house down.

5. An Oba Nodha

George MacKenzie, 2nd of Gruinard in Wester Ross (c. 1655 – c. 1735) was a grandson of George, 2nd earl of Seaforth. He married, first, in 1696, a widow, Margaret MacKenzie, granddaughter of Sir Roderick MacKenzie of Coigach (An Taoitear Tàileach). By her he is said to have had 23 children. He married, second, Elizabeth, a natural daughter of Lord President Duncan Forbes of Culloden, and by her he is said to have had 10 children, making an extraordinary total of 33 children from his two marriages, see Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Clan Mackenzie (Inverness, 1879), pp. 460–61. For his part in the 1715 rising see notes on poem 22, and for his business dealings in Lewis see notes on poem 2.

George MacKenzie’s only known poem other than the present one is a touching lament for his first wife, ‘Tha mo Chridhe air Fàs Trom’ (‘My Heart has Grown Heavy’), in the Gillies collection, pp. 55–58. Our poem is referred to by John Mackenzie (SO 58) in his account of Sìleas na Ceapaich (see poem 6): “During her residence in the North she composed several short pieces, among which is an answer to a song by Mr McKenzie of Gruineard called An obair nogha.”

The background to ‘An Oba Nodha’ is discussed by Ó Baoill at BSC 166. To my mind, it reads like a series of case studies for a sex education class, and it should be pointed out that the poet had nine daughters. It is presented as chatter amongst teenage girls, and would not be out of place nowadays in many glossy magazines. For the title and the term oba nodha, see notes on poem 6. Other terms for ‘sex’ in poems 5 and 6 include boga nodha, boga-bhriseadh and seana-bhog, in all of which bog(a) is to be seen as bogadh ‘steeping, dipping, wagging, bobbing’. Bogadh, in its genitive form bogaidh, appears in the simple meaning ‘sex’ in poem 16, line 19. None of the individuals named in poems 5 or 6 can be identified.

‘An Oba Nodha’ appears at pp. 3–5 of An Leobhar Liath, and Ó Baoill reprints it without translation at pp. 253–54 of BSC. As the entire contents of An Leobhar Liath (‘The Light-Blue Book’) are reproduced in An Lasair (see also poems 16, 48 and 62), it may be as well to say something about it here. It is fully described in Donald Maclean, Typographia Scoto-Gadelica (Edinburgh, 1915), pp. 246–47. It is a duodecimo volume of eight pages. The only text other than the four poems themselves is the front cover, which states (in translation):

THE / LIGHT-BLUE BOOK; / IN WHICH ARE / Four Excellent Songs: / THAT IS:— HECTOR THE RASCAL — / THE OOBIE NOOGIE / — MY HANDSOME LITTLE TINY HERO — / AND LITTLE BLACK DONNIE. / COMPOSED / BY LEARNED GENTLEMEN: / Now published at the request of, / and at the expense of many lovers / of true poetry. / PRINTED IN PAISLEY; / AND TO BE SOLD PRIVATELY BY / ITINERANT BOOKSELLERS. / 1801

[TD 373]

‘Paisley’ is in the original Baile nam Breabadairean, literally ‘The Weavers’ Town’. Also on the cover-page is the following curious piece of verse, which I reproduce unedited:

<gai>
———’S Leobhar an ‘Leobhar Liath;’
“Thereir iasg ris a’ bhreac bheag;
“Canar nead ri nead gach eoin,
“’S nead an dreadhainn duinn gur nead.”
<eng>

It can perhaps be translated: “The ‘Light-Blue Book’ is a book, / The little trout is called a fish; / Each bird’s nest is called a nest, / And the wren’s nest is a nest.” Donald Maclean states (p. 247) that ‘the Editorship of this very free poetical work is attributed to John Mackenzie, notwithstanding the difference in orthography’, by which he is probably referring to the spelling leobhar for leabhar. John Mackenzie (1806–48) is the celebrated compiler of SO but also of Eachdraidh Mhic Cruslig (Glasgow, 1836), which Maclean calls ‘rather a free production in prose, printed appropriately on blue paper’. Given Mackenzie’s reference to the present poem in SO, his editorship of An Leobhar Liath is a very strong possibility.

Maclean concludes his account of An Leobhar Liath by saying: “The year of publication is of course ante-dated. It was printed in Glasgow about 1845. Excessively rare. Only one copy known.” Perhaps in making his confident statement about the date and place of printing Maclean had access to further information which is lost to us today. Two copies are now known, in Glasgow University Library and the British Library, see Mary Ferguson and Ann Matheson, Scottish Gaelic Union Catalogue (Edinburgh, 1984), p. 86.

The poems in An Leobhar Liath are printed anonymously, so John Mackenzie’s statement in SO – together with further information brought together by Ó Baoill in BSC, pp. 167, 238 and 254 – is our source for the attribution to George MacKenzie.

6. An Aghaidh na h-Oba Nodha

Sìleas na Ceapaich (c. 1660 – c. 1729) was a Catholic lady with a very attractive poetic personality. A daughter of MacDonald of Keppoch in Lochaber, also connected with the Glencoe MacDonalds, in about 1685 she married the Marquis of Huntly’s factor for Lochaber, Alexander Gordon of Camdell. She went to live with him at Beldorney Castle in Banffshire, and appears to have reared a family of five sons and three daughters, while still keeping closely in touch with her Lochaber kinsfolk. She was widowed in 1720. In BSC Colm Ó Baoill assembles a corpus of 23 pieces, ranging from hymns through panegyrics (see poem 20 below) to more intimate items as exemplified by

[TD 374]

the present poem. Following his sources, Ó Baoill gives it as ‘An Aghaidh na h-Obair Nodha’, but as this strains grammar to breaking point (the genitive case of obair being oibre or obrach) I feel that it is unlikely to be correct.

Despite the fact that the sources for poems 5 and 6 are consistent in their use of obair or obar (‘work’), I believe that oba (‘charm, spell, incantation’) offers a very satisfactory solution. The best source for it is Alexander Carmichael’s Carmina Gadelica – especially vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1971), p. 252 (glossarial index, including five citations of oba/òba), and vol. 2 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1928), p. 337, where Carmichael gives instances of its use: Mairi bhreac nan ob ‘spotted (or pock-marked) Mary of the spells’; Bis i ris na h-ob ‘She practises spells’; Tha na h-ob a dol as ‘Spells are going out of use’. The form of the word varies: ob, òb, ub, ùb, obaidh, òbaidh, ubaidh, ùbaidh, ubhaidh, ùbhaidh, oba, òba, uba, ùba, obag, òbag, ubag, ùbag, etc. The varying length of the vowel can be explained by the frequency of its use in unstressed position; this certainly applies in the present instance, where nodha takes the stress and provides the rhyming vowel where required.

The first four lines of the poem support my case well, given that the oba(ir) nodha is represented as audible, indeed as something ‘intoned’ like a charm. Curiously, this opening was re-used by Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair to begin his ‘Dìomoladh Chabair Féidh’, see Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Poems of Alexander MacDonald (Inverness, 1924), p. 292:

<gai>
Gu bheil mi air mo bhódhradh
Le tóghnadh na h-ealdhanaich …
<eng>

(“I’m completely deafened / By intoning of verses …”) The fact that the word oba has to do with sgoil dhubh or the ‘black arts’ is of course entirely appropriate in the present context; nodha may represent ‘new’, or more likely (since there is nothing new about sex) Carmichael’s obscure word nò, nòd, nòdh, nòdadh, ‘knowledge, intelligence, information’, e.g. Ni bheil nò agam air ‘I have no knowledge of him’ (Carmina Gadelica, vol. 2, p. 337), cited by Dwelly as Cha’n ’eil nòdh agam air. By this token, the oba nodha is the ‘knowledge charm’, and indeed it is likely that the mysterious nodha is nothing more or less than the English word ‘know’ in its biblical sense. See also p. 436.

Ó Baoill’s sources are the Stewart collection of 1804, pp. 366–70 (eleven verses only), and Alexander Irvine’s manuscript of the same period, formerly NLS MS Acc. 3184. He prints the poem, with translation, at BSC 76–83, with notes at 165–68.

41–48 The reference is to the practice of discipline by kirk sessions in fornication cases, see Henry Grey Graham, The Social Life of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century (2nd edn, London, 1906), pp. 321–24.

108 I imagine Glencoe is cited here as representative of traditional Highland values at their best.


7. Òran Hirteach

This song exists in several versions, of which I print the earliest. It is in the MacDiarmid MS of 1770, from which it was published by Derick Thomson in his The MacDiarmid MS Anthology (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1991), p. 47. Thomson also prints three later versions (pp. 48–53); these identify the dead man as Ìomhair and the place of his death as a geò cumhang or ‘narrow inlet’. Soay is a small island west of the main island of St Kilda.


8. Latha Siubhal Sléibhe Dhomh

For the poet see poem 4. Mackenzie gives the poem at SO 81–82 with the following introduction:

This beautiful and pathetic song was composed by Mackinnon after the death of some of his relations. It would appear that while they lived, and while his own circumstances continued prosperous, he was much respected throughout the country, and was not unfrequently the guest and companion of the best gentry in the Highlands. No sooner, however, had death deprived him of his friends, and misfortune had robbed him of his gear, than he began to experience, from the world and his former patrons, the bitter indifference and coldness which poverty too often brings in her train. This he experienced in an especial manner, when, on a Christmas evening having gone to the Castle of Dunvegan, where the rest of the country gentry were, as usual on such occasions, enjoying the hospitality of the chief, poor Mackinnon was not only unnoticed and neglected, but repulsed from the hall, where, in worthier days, and under a worthier laird, he and his fathers were wont to be welcome guests. In consequence of this unhandsome treatment, the indignant bard returned instantly to Strath.

While pursuing his homeward journey through the lonely glen, beneath the towering Culeens, and while the fever of his resentment still burned within his bosom, he met, or imagined he met, Generosity, Love, and Liberality, outcasts, like himself, from the hearts and halls of highland lairds, and bitterly inveighing against the tyranny that thus exiled them, unfed and unclothed, from the abodes where they were accustomed to reign and revel. At length having reached his home, he went to bed, probably supperless, and gentle sleep not deigning to woo him, but in its stead the weeping muse, he composed, and, for the first time, sung [sic] this song. It was highly esteemed by the Highland bards and seanachais, the latter of whom entitled the tune to which it is

[TD 376]

sung, “Tri-amh Fonn na h-Alba,” or the third best air in Scotland;—we have not been able to ascertain what airs were considered the first and second.

In reference to the time and place where it was first sung, we may mention that it was a custom of the old highlanders, when they could not sleep, to sing on their beds, and that loud enough to waken all the inmates of the house, who, if the song was good, never grudged their slumbers being thus musically broken.


As shown at pp. xxv–xxvi, the song represents an important development in the rhetorical code of Gaelic verse. The idea of personifying Generosity, Love and Liberality as human beings is non-Gaelic; it may be seen as derived from contemporary Augustan verse in English.

I take the song from BGh 144–49, while noting some variants in early published sources – the Eigg collection of 1776 (pp. 93–96), the Stewart collection of 1804 (pp. 488–94) and SO 81–82. Eigg has fourteen stanzas, the others seventeen. The title in Eigg and the Stewart collection is ‘Òran do Dhaoin’ Uaisle an Eilein Sgiathanaich’ (‘A Song to the Gentlemen of Skye’). Mackenzie calls it ‘Latha Siubhal Sléibhe’, however, and that is the name by which its famous tune is generally known. Versions published between 1841 and 1918 were taken from SO; for a complete source-list see Ó Baoill and MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 14.

33 Sir Norman MacLeod of Berneray, son of Sir Roderick MacLeod of Dunvegan. He died 3 March 1705. An earlier poet referred to him in similar terms as leannan an t-sùgraidh (‘the lover of fun’, ‘the flirtatious darling’), see J. C. Watson (ed.), Gaelic Songs of Mary MacLeod (SGTS, 2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1965), p. 24.

38 Iain Breac (elder brother of Sir Norman), chief of the MacLeods of Dunvegan 1664–93.

60–62 There were four chiefs of Sleat called Dòmhnall Gorm; here Sir Dòmhnall Gorm Òg, who died in 1643, is probably meant. ‘Brother’ is intended metaphorically, thus also line 93.

76 SO here has not ùdail but iùdmhail – ‘You were no black sheep in the flock’, cf. poem 57, line 17. If the first syllable of iudmhail can indeed be long, this is a better reading.

79–80 MacKenzie of Applecross was noted for his generosity. An Irish harper who had been on circuit in Scotland – his name, according to John Mackenzie, was Cailean Cormac – was asked, Creud í an lámh bu féile do fhuarais a n-Albain? “Which is the most generous hand you have found in Scotland?” He answered, Lámh dheas Fhir na Comraich. “The Laird of Applecross’s right hand.” He was then asked, Creud í an ath té? “Which is the second most generous?” And he said, Lámh chlí Fhir na Comraich. “The Laird of Applecross’s left hand” (SO 81–82, BGh 302).

MS 72.2.2, f. 33r, the MacKinnons are styled sliocht Chairbre réidh Righfhoda, the descendants of Cairbre Riada, said to have founded the Scottish colony of Dalriada in Argyll in the 3rd century AD. SO here has Ailpeanaich mhath chiar-dhuibh / ’Gam bu dùthchas riamh an Srath (‘O good dusky-black MacKinnon / Whose inheritance was always Strath’), which offers improved aicill rhyme chiar : riamh. See poem 23, note on line 21.

103–04 SO here has the pedestrian ’S a-nise bhon a thriall thu bhuainn / Chan iarrar sinn a-staigh (‘And now that you have left us / We’re not invited in’), possibly for no better reason than that Mackenzie could not understand the reading in front of him.

117 Hallowe’en was the time for laying in supplies of beef for the winter, often by the strong hand; cf. S mairg air ’n dèanadh feachd Ui Dhuibhne / Creach na Samhna (‘Unfortunate were they on whom Campbell’s host made / The Hallowe’en raid’), BGh 261. Bealltainn, 1 May, was a time for collecting taxes. See also p. xxxiii.

118 The Stewarts have not cha do léibh but cha b’e ’r beus – ‘Nor was it our practice at Beltane’.

131 The verb buinnig derives from English ‘win’, and the Stewarts’ spelling reflects this – bhuinig.

9. An Fhìdeag Airgid

With a small number of exceptions (e.g. poems 41 and 50) waulking songs are impossible to date with any precision, even to within a given century. That is because they tend to deal with the lives of ordinary women who are not normally named (e.g. poem 3) and because they are formulaic in nature. Rather than telling a specific story from beginning to end, they draw upon a stock of phrases bearing loosely upon a general theme. After all, their function was to provide rhythm and adrenalin to waulk a bale of cloth, and considerations of entertainment, instruction or art were strictly secondary. Fresh phrases would continue to be given out until the cloth was waulked.

What I here call ‘An Fhìdeag Airgid’ is merely one version of a snatch of waulking song which is of interest to us because it contains a Jacobite motif and can therefore be safely regarded as reaching its existing form in (or after) the eighteenth century. Our lines 8–11 are probably best known as belonging to a song called ‘Mhic Iarla nam

[TD 378]

Bratach Bàna’ (‘O Son of the Earl of the White Banners’, Hebridean Folksongs I, pp. 86–89), and since in that song they usually include reference to silk from Galway, they may date from as early as the fifteenth century, when the power of the Galway merchants reached its height. The use of the silver whistle on ships to honour visiting dignitaries goes back at least to 1532, when Henry VIII enacted that all English ships’ masters should wear silver whistles with silver chains (Hebridean Folksongs III, p. 296), but it seems invariably to be followed by the line Mac mo rìgh a’ tighinn do dh’Alba (‘My king’s son to Scotland’s coming’, our line 3), so as a topos it may be Jacobite in origin.

The above-mentioned motifs coincide in a South Uist version of the song ‘Siùbhlaidh Mi ’s Fàgaidh Mi ’m Fearann’ (‘I Will Go, I’ll Leave the Country’, Hebridean Folksongs I, pp. 136–39). Other variations obtained in Barra, of which ours is one, develop the Jacobite theme. One of them (Hebridean Folksongs III, p. 224) goes so far as to mention King George.

<gai>
’S chuireadh iad na Goill gu’n dùbhshlan
’S chuireadh iad Rìgh Seòras dhachaigh
Do Hanóbhar a-null fairis.
<eng>

(“And they’d put Lowlanders to defiance / And they’d send King George back home / Across the sea to Hanover.”) It is hardly surprising that, as Dr Campbell points out (Hebridean Folksongs III, p. 295), lines such as these and our line 17 gave rise to a popular tradition that ‘An Fhìdeag Airgid’ was made to Prince Charles Edward in 1745, but the balance of evidence is against it. For one thing, Charles Edward is nowhere mentioned. (I note, however, Teàrlach òg nan gorm-shùl meallach, / Fàilte, fàilte, mùirn is cliù dhut, ‘Young Charles of blue beguiling eyes, / Welcome, welcome, joy and fame to you’, in Alma NicShimidh and Dòmhnall Iain MacÌomhair, Bonaidean is Breacain (Stornoway, 1996), p. 32, where regrettably the source is not given.) For another, talk of crowning applies correctly to James Francis in 1715, but not to Charles Edward in 1745, as James was the claimant to the throne throughout the period from 1701 to his death in 1766. For another, specific matters of detail point to the earlier dating, most notably our reference at line 13 to Ewen Cameron, who can only be Sir Ewen of Lochiel, chief of the Camerons from 1647 until his death in 1719. Finally one has to ask why, if Jacobite imagery was still in the process of active creation in waulking-songs in 1745, Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair felt a need to provide women with propaganda of his own making for them to sing – see J. L. Campbell (ed.), Highland Songs of the ’45 (2nd edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 144–53.

‘An Fhìdeag Airgid’ is therefore best dated to 1715. I take it from J. L. Campbell (ed.), Hebridean Folksongs III (Oxford, 1981), pp. 222–24. Campbell got it from Miss Annie Johnston (Anna Aonghais Chaluim).

[TD 379]

8-11 The description is fanciful as well as formulaic. The helm of gold and the well of wine also make their appearance in ‘Tàladh Dhòmhnaill Ghuirm’ (‘Dòmhnall Gorm’s Lullaby’), which can tentatively be dated c. 1610 (BGh 246–49).

10. Òran nam Fineachan

Iain Dubh mac Iain mhic Ailein (John MacDonald, c. 1665 – c. 1725) belonged to the Morar branch of the Clanranald MacDonalds. Little is known for certain about him, but he appears to have led an easy and unremarkable life. He may have been born in Moidart. He had a tack of Grulin in Eigg, and may have moved c. 1700 to Ormiclate in South Uist as aos-dàna or resident poet to Clanranald. He seems to have died in Benbecula. Eleven songs survive which can be ascribed to him with some degree of certainty; they have been published in Colm Ó Baoill (ed.), Iain Dubh (Aberdeen 1994). See also poems 13 and 15.

‘Òran nam Fineachan’ was made in 1715 when the clans were gathering for the Jacobite rising. The ’15 began with the raising of the standard on the Braes of Mar on 6 September – emblazoned with the thistle, the arms of Scotland, and ‘No Union’ – and ended with the indecisive but humiliating battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November, at which the Duke of Argyll’s army of 3,500 men held off 9,000 Jacobites under the Earl of Mar. The song is discussed by Dr John Maclnnes in his paper ‘The Panegyric Code in Gaelic Poetry and its Historical Background’, TGSI 50 (1976–78), pp. 435–98: 465–66, where however his comments relate specifically to the BGh version.

Other songs of the ‘Òran nam Fineachan’ type will be found in J. L. Campbell’s Highland Songs of the ’45 (2nd edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 72–85 (by Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair), in Robert Stewart’s collection of 1802, pp. 69–79 (by Robert Stewart), in MacCallum’s collection of 1821, pp. 96–103 (anonymous), and in the Menzies collection of 1870, pp. 335–41 (by John MacGregor).

There is an up-to-date edition of the text in Iain Dubh, pp. 23–27, so I take it from there. As Ó Baoill based it on the MacLagan and MacNicol manuscripts (see his notes, pp. 51–55), it is substantially different from the version in BGh 149–55, which Watson took from Eigg, SO and Sinclair’s Gaelic Bards. There is a third version, as yet unpublished, in the MacDiarmid MS. See Ó Baoill and MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 11.

1–2 Thomas Rhymer was believed to have prophesied that the Gael would win back Scotland at a great battle to be fought on the River Clyde. See poem 33, note on line 28; poem 37, note on line 19; BSC 153; and my articles ‘The Messiah of the Gael’ (WHFP, 16 January 1998), ‘How did Thomas become the

[TD 380]

Messiah?’ (WHFP, 30 January 1998) and ‘A Century of Coded Messages’ (WHFP, 13 February 1998).

23 Louis XIV died on 1 September 1715 and the confidently-expected French help did not materialise.

25–26, 29–30 These lines were borrowed into the 19th-century song ‘An t-Aparan Dearg’, see Donald A. Macdonald, ‘Songs of the Balranald Elopement’, TGSI 57 (1990–92), pp. 1–57: 16.

33 The Munros and Roses, along with the Frasers (line 113), ultimately came out against the Jacobites in 1715. The Roses of Kilravock took Inverness from the Jacobites on 13 November 1715, the same day as Sheriffmuir. See note on poem 22, lines 19–24.

36 The Dunbars lived in the Laigh of Moray.

39 The Clann Reubhair or ‘Clan Rhymer’ were the MacDonalds of Dalness in Glen Etive. They were Glencoe MacDonalds, and appear to have received their by-name from their reputation as poets, or from their descent from a particular poet. They are by no means out of place here in the geography of the poem, since they shared Rannoch Moor with Robertsons and others. However, the Clan Donald have already received a stanza, and Clann Reubhair is intentionally ambiguous. It is equally an evocation of the ghostly cavalry being gathered in the otherworld by Thomas Rhymer, ready to ride forth at a given signal from Tomnahurich or Dumbuck to fight the last great battle that would win back Scotland for the Gael. Most such references in Gaelic verse appear at the end of a poem, in the place traditionally reserved for prayer; the effect is that Thomas is evoked as the Jacobite messiah in place of Christ. The best and most apposite example of this is the final stanza of John MacCodrum’s ‘Moladh Chlann Dòmhnaill’, which dates from about 1760, when Jacobite hopes were all but dead. MacCodrum (for whom see poem 46) praises Clan Donald and then their allies, and mention of the Frasers brings him finally to Tomnahurich in Fraser territory, where Thomas sleeps with his army.

40 This image might be felt to be more appropriate to an otherworld army than a disciplined eighteenth-century one. However, we find it again at poem 15, line 22, in reference to the Clanranald. It is an appeal to warrior qualities: bloodlust, pride, lack of fear, speed in attack. These were battle-winning qualities for the Jacobites when they had a good general, such as Montrose in 1645, Dundee in 1689, or Lord George Murray in 1745.

48 The MacDonalds claimed descent from Conn Ceudchathach, Conn of the Hundred Battles, from whom their ‘bardic’ surname was Ó Cuinn – just as that of the Campbells was Ó Duibhne, hence na Guibhnich, line 121. Sìol Chuinn are literally ‘the Seed of Conn’. See poem 33, note on line 5.

65 For an Dreòllainn, ‘greater Mull’, see poem 21, note on line 1.

99 There are amusing echoes of this line (from BGh, no doubt) in Norman Campbell’s satirical twentieth-century poem ‘Mi Fhìn agus a’ Revolution agus mo Bhata-Darach’, see my An Tuil (Edinburgh, 1999), pp. 584, 586.

101 The term air chorr-ghleus means ‘aroused’, ‘brought into a state of animation’. It became a subject of grave discussion in 1735 when the Rev. Archibald Campbell, minister of Morvern, was on trial before the Presbytery of Mull on charges of ‘drunkenness, swearing, squabbling, [wife-]beating, and offering to fight with sword’. A witness described his state on one occasion as air chorr-ghleus, and Campbell objected in the following terms to this being translated ‘the worse of liquor’:

Corghleus, or the word inverted, Gleus-cor, shows no more than that cheerful humour which a moderate glass puts one in, which humour or temper is not his ordinary, or which he did not fully discover at first sitting down. That was the term the deponent used to express my disposition that night; but wrongously translated in the minutes.


See William Mackay, ‘Presbyterial Notices of Mac Mhaighstir Alastair, and some of his Contemporaries in Ardnamurchan and Morven’, TGSI 11 (1884–85), pp. 171–84: 178; James Ross, Whisky (London, 1970), p. 36.

126 “After Diarmaid follows another Duibne whose son Malcolm travels to France where he ‘took in marriage the heretrix of Beochamps (that is to say Campus Bellus or pleasant field) being sister daughter of William the Conqueror’. Malcom’s [sic] eldest son Dionysius or Duncan stays in France and

founds the family of Beauchamp, but his second son Gillespic returns to Scotland where he marries his cousin Eva …” (W. D. H. Sellar, ‘The Earliest Campbells – Norman, Briton or Gael?’, Scottish Studies, vol. 17 (1973), pp. 109–25: 115, quoting the seventeenth-century ‘Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells’). I take the term ‘sister daughter’ to mean the offspring of William’s incest with his mother, cf. Rosalind Mitchison and Leah Leneman, Girls in Trouble: Sexuality and Social Control in Rural Scotland 1660–1780 (Edinburgh, 1998), p. 98.

129 The Créitheach is presumably the place marked on maps as Srath na Creitheach, at the foot of the Cuillins in Skye – a likely rallying-place for expeditions by the MacKinnons of Strath against the MacLeods. MacFhionghain bhon Chréithich is mentioned in a waulking-song published in J. L. Campbell (ed.), Hebridean Folksongs II (Oxford, 1977), p. 28. Campbell identified it (p. 365) as being in Skye, but in Hebridean Folksongs III (Oxford, 1981), p. 430, he said that it was ‘more probably the district of that name in the Ross of Mull, cradle of the MacKinnons’.

135–36 Again, a rallying-place is probably meant – the MacNeils will come from what is now Northbay, at that time the principal area of settlement in Barra as well as the safest anchorage, to their chief’s residence at Kismul in the south of the island. Kismul is referred to as ‘the Tower’ or ‘the Towers’ in Hebridean Folksongs II, pp. 28, 118. A’ chabhlach mhór làidir ‘the great strong armada’ is in any case a doubtful reading – MacNicol has ’n Con-laoch, altered to Con-laoich, while MacLagan has an Conlach, glossed ‘multitude’.

145 In the same way, Sìleas na Ceapaich originally forgot to mention John of Breadalbane in her poem of praise to the heroes of Sheriffmuir (BSC 42). We need not doubt but that here are two examples of the creation of literature in an oral tradition.The first version having already gone out to become a living part of the ceilidh-house repertoire, it cannot be changed – it can, however, be added to, provided the addition is clearly marked as such.

159 Watson (BGh 303) believed that mùiseag nan Dùbhghall represented the threats of the Lowlanders, but MacInnes (TGSI 50, p. 466) and Ó Baoill (Iain Dubh, p. 55) agree that this is unlikely to be correct. As the third stanza indicates, Gaelic and Jacobite rhetoric were at one in seeing the ’15 as a pan-Scottish struggle against an Act of Succession arbitrarily imposed on Scotland by English parliamentarians.

11. Tha Tighinn Fodham Éirigh

The subject of this well-known song is Ailean Dearg, chief of Clanranald, who was mortally wounded at Sheriffmuir in 1715 (see poems 12, 13, 15). According to Keith Norman Macdonald, Macdonald Bards from Mediæval Times (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 31, its author was a Clanranald MacDonald from Benbecula. James Boswell learned to sing it:

I could now sing a verse of the song Hatyin foam’eri, made in honour of Allan, the famous Captain of Clanranald, who fell at Sherrif-muir; whose servant, who lay on the field watching his master’s dead body, being asked next day who that was, answered, “He was a man yesterday.” (Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), p. 336)


Boswell made a translation of the song into English verse, for which see Macdonald Bards, p. 32.

The song was first published in the Eigg collection (1776), pp. 113–14. I take it from BGh 139–41, where the text is based on that in Eigg. Benjamin Urquhart – EUL MS Mackinnon 10B, ff. 159r–160r (pp. 37–39) – gives a few useful alternative readings, as does Mackenzie’s collection of 1836, pp. 43–44. Derick Thomson (ed.), The MacDiarmid MS Anthology (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1991), pp. 64–69, provides the most thorough modern edition of it, citing eleven different sources. His text, although the earliest known (it dates from 1770), is far from being the standard one, however, and is probably of Perthshire origin. After our line 20 it turns into a satire on a certain Molly Macintosh, and is chiefly of interest for its reference to Titian, in the sense of an alluringly fleshy female such as in that artist’s Venus of Urbino or Diana and Callisto – sketches of Titian’s paintings were beginning to circulate in Scotland at that period.

[TD 384]

Martin described it like this:

The ancient dress wore by the women, and which is yet wore by some of the vulgar, called arisad, is a white plaid, having a few small stripes of black, blue, and red. It reached from the neck to the heels, and was tied before on the breast with a buckle of silver or brass, according to the quality of the person. (A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland circa 1695 (1994 edn, Edinburgh), p. 247)


At the end, in 1793, the Rev. John Lane Buchanan described it like this:

The women wear long or short gowns, with a waistcoat and two petticoats … The arrisats are quite laid aside in all this country, by the different ranks of women; being the most ancient dress used by that class. It consisted of one large piece of flannel, that reached down to the shoe, and fastened with clasps below, and the large silver broach at the breast, while the whole arm was entirely naked. The ladies made use of the finer, while common women used coarser kinds of flannel, or white woollen cloths. (Travels in the Western Hebrides from 1782 to 1790 (new edn, Lusta, Waternish, Skye, 1997), pp. 37–38)

15–16 A. Maclean Sinclair, in The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), p. 9, gives ’S gach àit’ an d’fhuaradh sealladh dhiot / Gu dealasach an déidh ort (‘Everywhere that you’ve been glimpsed / Who passionately love you’).

15–20 The place-names appear to delineate the territory most familiar to Allan of Clanranald: France and Italy, Benbecula and South Uist. He lived in France for many years before returning to build Ormiclate Castle c. 1697, Castle Tirrim having been garrisoned by the government from 1689 to 1698. Balivanich is in Benbecula, while Eilean Bheagram is the island in Loch an Eilein, Drimisdale (Drèamasdal), South Uist. It contained a fortress and some dwelling-houses (Rev. Archibald Macdonald, ‘Gleanings from Charter Chests of the Isles’, TGSI 38 (1937–41), pp. 357–406: 388), and is probably to be seen as the stronghold of the MacMhuirich poet-historians, who had a tack of the four pennylands of Drimisdale (see notes on poem 12). Kilpheder was the principal church of the pre-reformation parish of Kandish, i.e. An Ceann a-Deas, the southern half of South Uist.

22 The bréid (‘kertch’) was worn by married women only. Martin described it (p. 248) as ‘a fine kerchief of linen strait [tight] about the head, hanging down the back taper-wise’, while Buchanan remarked (p. 38) that ‘the breeid, or curtah [sic, for ‘curtch’], a fine linen handkerchief fastened about married women’s heads, with a flap hanging behind their backs, above

[TD 385]

the guilechan [shoulder-plaid], is mostly laid aside’. Dwelly defines it as a ‘square of fine linen pinned round the head, and fastened with cords of silk or pins of silver or gold, donned by a woman the morning after her marriage, and regarded as the badge of wifehood’. The linen was starched as stiffly as possible, which is presumably what suggested the pulpit simile.

39 For the Clanranald arms see poem 37, note on lines 71–75. Although it does not show in the translation, bradanan is plural, which is not (I think) heraldically accurate; Urquhart offers instead bradan-geal (‘silver salmon’), which fixes the problem but is metrically a little weak.


12. Òran do dh’Ailean Dearg

Niall MacMhuirich (1636x39–1726), son of Domhnall Gearr, was an important member of a dynasty of literate poet-historians who served the MacDonald kings of the Isles and their Clanranald successors for nearly six hundred years – the length of time between the arrival in Scotland c. 1216 of their progenitor Muireadhach Albannach Ó Dálaigh, and a statement by Lachlann MacMhuirich in 1800 that he could not write.

Niall’s work is described in two papers by Derick S. Thomson, ‘The Poetry of Niall MacMhuirich’, TGSI 46 (1969–70), pp. 281–307, and ‘Three Seventeenth-Century Bardic Poets: Niall Mór, Cathal and Niall MacMhuirich’, in A. J. Aitken, M. P. McDiarmid and D. S. Thomson (eds), Bards and Makars (Glasgow, 1977), pp. 221–46. A loyal ‘civil servant’ to the Clanranald court, he appears to have inherited a tack of Stilligarry and the four pennylands of Drimisdale in South Uist. His confident and distinctive handwriting, using the traditional corra-litir or ‘quarter-uncial’ Gaelic script, is almost ubiquitous in the ‘Highland Society of London Collection’, the manuscripts obtained by James Macpherson in South Uist in 1760 and now in the National Library of Scotland (see notes on poem 59). He is the writer of much of the Little Book of Clanranald, now MCR 39 in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, which contains (among much else) a Gaelic history of the MacDonalds of Clanranald of which he may safely be regarded as the author.

According to Professor Thomson, the corpus of surviving poems which can be ascribed with certainty to Niall amounts to ten items, of which eight are in classical Gaelic and two in the vernacular. Three of these ten are to Allan of Clanranald, who was chief from 1686: the present poem, composed on hearing that he had been wounded at Sheriffmuir; a classical elegy beginning Do thúirlinn seasuimh Síol Cuinn, ‘The MacDonalds’ standing has declined’; and a vernacular elegy beginning Och a Mhuire, mo dhunaidh, ‘O Mary Mother, my misfortune’. The reason that Allan stimulated such a high level of creativity

[TD 386]

(see also poems 11 and 13) appears to be that he presided over a revival of cultural and social life in his island territories following the misfortunes which overtook his family earlier in the seventeenth century, and which were well catalogued by Niall. Clearly the cultural revival embraced tradition and innovation in equal measure, thus encouraging Niall to make songs in the vernacular, such as the present one, as well as continuing to compose learned poems in strict metre. We know of no mixing of modes, however: that is, we have no evidence whatever that Niall put down his songs in writing, or that his classical poems entered the oral tradition of the people.

I take the poem from the Inverness collection of 1806 (pp. 42–44), MacFarlane’s collection of 1813 (pp. 180–82), and SO 65–66, where it is entitled ‘Òran. Do Mhac-Mhic-Ailein’ (‘A Song. To Clanranald’), with two or three preferred readings from the Eigg collection of 1776, pp. 73–75. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 22.

10 Allan’s maternal grandfather was John MacLeod of Dunvegan (Iain Breac), for whom see poem 8, line 38. Presumably the poet calls him an earl because of his Norse descent.

11 Allan’s father was Donald, chief of Clanranald 1670–86. In his Clanranald history Niall calls him ‘this good man’, but he suffered a change of character which brought a darker side to the fore and caused him to be nicknamed Dòmhnall Dubh na Cuthaige after his gun. See Alexander Cameron, Reliquiæ Celticæ, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1894), p. 209, and the chapter ‘“Black Donald of the Cuckoo” and Canna’ in J. L. Campbell, Canna: The Story of a Hebridean Island (Oxford, 1984), pp. 74–85. Donald was born about 1615, and if he gave Niall ‘shelter when young’ it must have been because his father had sent him to Uist.

17 The asseveration Nàile (sometimes air Nàile) is ubiquitous in Gaelic verse even down to Sorley MacLean (1911–96). Being well aware of its use in poetry, Martin Martin says of the Arran people that ‘their ordinary asseveration is by Nale, for I did not hear any oath in the island’ (DWI 260). Pennant in 1772 is closer to the mark: “There was another species of honour paid to the chieftains, that I believe is still retained in this island [Arran], but the reason is quite lost; that of swearing by his name, and paying as great a respect to that as to the most sacred oath: a familiar one in Arran is, by Nail: it is at present unintelligible, yet is suspected to have been the name of some ancient hero.” See Thomas Pennant, A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides 1772 (1998 edn, Edinburgh), pp. 174–75.

For the Nàile of hagiography see Charles Plummer, ‘Life of Naile’, in Miscellanea Hagiographica Hibernica (Brussels, 1925),

[TD 387]

pp. 97–155. If Loch Mo Nàire in Strathnaver takes its name from him, the popularity of the expression is explained, because this loch was regarded as the most sacred and efficacious place of healing in the north of Scotland. See Mrs Mary MacLeod Banks, British Calendar Customs: Scotland, vol. 1 (The Folk-Lore Society, London, 1937), pp. 130–31, and my articles ‘By God and St Nàile?’ (WHFP, 26 January 1990) and ‘The Patron Saint of Yuppies?’ (WHFP, 9 February 1990).

23 Orally, MacDhòmhnaill is ambiguous: it could be mac Dhòmhnaill, ‘the son of Donald’, in which case the ‘earlier Donald’ of line 25 becomes a reference to Dòmhnall mac Ailein, 11th of Clanranald, who died in 1618.

26 The sources have Iain, but I prefer the older spelling Eathain here as it better reflects rhyme with roimhe, aighir, flatha, caitheamh. The reference is to Allan’s grandfather John of Moidart, chief of Clanranald from 1618 to 1670.

34 I take the reading gan lasadh from Eigg. SO has gan losgadh ‘being burned’, thus employing the same end-word twice in the stanza. Lasadh maintains acceptable end-rhyme feasgar : losgadh : chosg leibh : lasadh : brosnachadh, see poem 4, note on line 24.

41 A crios-cùil is literally a ‘back-belt’. I take it that the game in question is iomlaid bhiodag as described in the notes to poem 4. The term crios-cùil is otherwise unknown to me. It implies a belt hidden from the front. Iomlaid bhiodag may thus be seen as no ordinary game, but a device to relieve guests permanently of concealed weapons and so to discourage the practice of carrying them. Presumably the weapon in question is of the type referred to in English dictionaries as ‘skene-occle’ or the like – sgian achlais, ‘an oxter knife’, worn under the plaid.

44 SO has aoigheil ‘hospitable’, but I prefer the Eigg reading iùlmhor ‘sensible’ as it provides more satisfying rhyme fìuran : iùlmhor : mùinte : ùiseil : chùirt.

53 Literally ‘If I don’t, Gaelic will take more out of me’, referring to the difficulty of articulating thoughts in speech at such a time.


13. Marbhrann do dh’Ailean Dearg

For the poet see poem 10. Allan of Clanranald (for whom see poem 12) was wounded in the battle of Sheriffmuir and taken to Drummond Castle, where he died next day, 14 November 1715. He was buried at Innerpeffray near Crieff. For the battle and the events leading to it, see notes on poem 22.

This is a very fine elegy by any standards, but its concluding structure is highly traditional, ending as it does with stanzas addressed

[TD 388]

to the heir, to the widow and to God, see p. 527, section 8. It appears not to have been made, or at least completed, until the autumn or winter of 1716, given that we are told at line 71 that Ronald, Allan’s brother and heir (for whom see poem 15), had departed in the summer. He went to join the Jacobite exiles in France, where he died in 1725. The heir’s departure in such circumstances is particularly destabilising: as MacInnes says of poems such as these (TGSI 50 (1976–78), p. 436), ‘the diction is codified in sets of conventional images, most densely concentrated in the heroic elegy composed at the point of crisis brought about by the death of a leader – in other words, when it was most necessary to reaffirm the traditional values of the community’.

As there is an up-to-date edition of the text in Colm Ó Baoill (ed.), Iain Dubh (Aberdeen, 1994), pp. 33–35, I take it from there. Ó Baoill lists his sources at pp. 59–60. See also Ó Baoill and MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 11.

1 1716 was a leap year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars.

47 Roinn gaoithe, literally ‘dividing wind’, appears to mean determining the direction and speed of wind in relation to terrain. Gaoth and talamh are mentioned in an almost identical context in ‘Còmhradh eadar an Sealgair agus a Ghunna’ (‘A Conversation between the Hunter and his Gun’) by Lachlan MacPherson of Strathmashie, for whom see poem 40. The gun says to the hunter concerning the deer:

<gai>
Theirig-sa mun cuairt gu h-eòlach
’S na bi deònach air am fuadach,
Roinn a’ ghaoth is fiar am’ thalamh
’S na tig aineolach mun cuairt dhaibh.
<eng>

I take this to mean: “Circle around in command of the facts / And don’t be willing to drive them away, / Check the wind as there’s grass in my ground / And don’t come unknowing about them.” The bending of the grass allows the direction and speed of the wind to be determined before the trigger is squeezed. See Thomas Sinton, ‘Gaelic Poetry from the MSS of the late Mr James Macpherson, Edinburgh’, TGSI 24 (1899–1901), pp. 394–412: 410–11.

53 There is a play on words here: cuileinean cuaine are ‘pups of a litter’ but cuileinean cuain would be ‘pups of an ocean’, young sea-dogs as it were.


14. Gaoir nam Ban Muileach

Mairearad nighean Lachlainn is believed to have lived from c. 1660 to after 1751. There has been much debate as to whether she was a MacLean or a MacDonald, but according to the most detailed study of

[TD 389]

the matter, the Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair’s ‘Who Was Mairearad Nigh’n Lachainn?’, The Celtic Review, vol. 7 (1911), pp. 193–203, she was nighean Lachainn mhic Iain mhic Lachainn, a MacLean on both her father’s and her mother’s side. Probably born in Mull, she lived for a long time either there or in Morvern. Sinclair thinks she must have been a daughter of Lachlan, son of Iain Diùrach (a brother of Eachann Òg of Torloisk), son of Lachlann Òg of Torloisk, son of Lachlann Mór MacLean of Duart (1557–98). Her mother may have been a daughter of Lachlan, son of Iain Dubh of Morvern; of Allan of Ardtornish (b. c. 1574); or of Charles of Ardnacross, for whom see notes on poem 21. She may have married a MacDonald and gone to live with him in Moidart or Ardnamurchan – she had relatives in those places, as well as in Mull, Morvern, Ardgour and Kingairloch. However, Sinclair says that she had a large family, that all her children died before herself, and that she nursed sixteen MacLeans of the best families in Mull; this suggests to me that when she was in milk she was not in Moidart or in Ardnamurchan but in MacLean territory.

According to Sinclair, like her own children, all sixteen MacLeans whom Mairearad had nursed predeceased her. “She used to go very frequently to the grave of the last of them and sit there. She was a very old woman, and much bent by old age.” In his ‘Notes on Mary MacLeod’ in TGSI 41 (1951–52), pp. 11–25: 15–16, 24, the Rev. William Matheson commented that Mairearad nighean Lachlainn was said in Mull to have been ‘buried’ by being placed face down on the surface of the ground and stones piled on top of her. He compared this to the fate of Màiri nighean Alastair Ruaidh in Harris, another woman who composed big songs of praise, said to have been buried in Rodel face downwards; and to the Norse practice of burying a witch under a heap of stones, as mentioned in the ‘Laxdæla Saga’. The implication is that the making of songs like this was regarded as unnatural and improper for a woman.

Printing just seven stanzas of this poem in SO 400, Mackenzie comments:

Like all local poets, Ni’ Lachuinn has been applauded by her countrymen in general, though we must confess that we are blind to any poetic grandeur in her compositions. We have seen twenty-five pieces of composing, but the above seven stanzas is her chef d’œuvre.


This is a remarkable statement. In his essay ‘Mairearad Nighean Lachlainn’, in William Gillies (ed.), Ris a’ Bhruthaich: The Criticism and Prose Writings of Sorley MacLean (Stornoway, 1985), pp. 162–76 (translated as ‘Margaret Daughter of Lachlan’, pp. 177–90), Sorley MacLean found only eleven extant poems that can be ascribed to her, so if Mackenzie’s twenty-five is a correct figure, the loss is great. (All eleven extant poems are to MacLeans; of these, no less than four, including the ‘Gaoir’, are to Sir John.) Even more surprising is Mackenzie’s low opinion of Mairearad’s ability. Sorley MacLean felt that the most

[TD 390]

frequent note in her poems was what he called cumhachd thiamhaidh – ‘an eerie power’, and he also notes a ‘cutting restraint’ which puts her ‘nearer Voltaire than Iain Lom’. She was, he says, ‘weighed down and wearied all the time with the great distresses that Clan Gillean suffered because of their loyalty to the Stewart family’, and it may be this elegiac tone that was disliked by Mackenzie.

There is a demotic touch to the ‘Gaoir’ which is particularly appealing today. “There is no elegy for a chief in Gaelic poetry in which the real voice of the whole clan is so poignant and certain as it is in ‘The Cry of the Mull Women’,” wrote Sorley MacLean. “It could be compared with the best of them in a noble perfection of language.” The Rev. Archibald Farquharson, Tiree, said: “When two or three sing it together, and the whole join in chorus at the sixth line, I have seldom heard singing like it.” See ‘The Songs and Melodies of the Gael’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 1 (1875–76), pp. 179–85: 182.

Sir John MacLean of Duart (1670–1716), only son of Sir Allan, was a staunch Jacobite, seeing support for the Stuarts as the only way to prise his territories free from the grip of the Campbells. At the age of 18 or 19 he commanded the MacLeans at Killiecrankie. He was one of a number of Jacobite leaders whom the governor of Fort William attempted to arrest in 1714. He escaped, but caught a cold from which he never recovered. A year later he joined Mar with 400 men shortly before Sheriffmuir, and after the battle he became unwell at Perth. He took leave of his men at Keith and went to Gordon Castle near Fochabers in Moray, where he died of consumption on 12 March 1716, aged 46. He was buried in the Church of Raffin in Banffshire, in the family vault of the Gordons of Buckie (see line 29). Pointing out that he was the last of the powerful lords of Duart, Maclean Sinclair says in The Clan Gillean (Charlottetown, 1899), p. 236:

Sir John of Duart was a man of good ability, and was thoroughly honest and honourable in his ways. He was well educated, and spoke Gaelic, English, and French fluently. He was generous by nature, affable in his manners, brave and cool in battle, and fitted in every way to command the respect and love of his clan.


I take the poem from BGh 133–39. Watson omitted three stanzas, however (the 15th, 16th and 24th); these I have taken from Turner’s collection, pp. 1–8. I give other readings from Turner in my notes. A very different version was published in MacCallum’s collection of 1821 (referred to by Sorley MacLean from the name of its printer as James Fraser’s collection). It has eleven stanzas, of which the first and last are the same; as compared to our other sources, all are broadly recognisable, while one (MacCallum’s sixth) is a conflation of lines from three different stanzas. It will perhaps convey some of the performance-derived flavour of MacCallum’s version if I cite his reading of our lines 17 and 73–81. Line 17 is Gur h-e turas horo ’n earraich sa leòn mi – ‘How this spring horo journey has wounded me’, in which horo is a meaning-

[TD 391]

less pair of vocables and leòn mi fails to rhyme with blàraibh, bàs uait, etc. Lines 73–81 are:

<gai>
Mhoire, ’s mise th’ air mo sgaradh
O Fhéill Brìghde sa chaïdh,
O Fhéill Mìcheil ’s o Shamhain —
Chaidh a-sìos sliochd ar taighe,
Thàinig dìle tha athbhuailt’;
S mis’ an truaghan bochd mnatha
A tha faondrach, gun fharraid
Thaobh nàmhaid no caraid,

(“Blessed Virgin, I’m bereft / Since last St Brigid’s Day, / Since St Michael’s and All Hallows — / Our household has gone down, / The flood has struck again; / I’m the poor wretch of womanhood / Who’s wandering, unasked for / By enemy or kin, / With no chief on side of father or mother, / With no chief on side of father or mother.”) A. Maclean Sinclair provided a 22-stanza version with some further interesting readings in The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), pp. 89–96, and reprinted it in The Maclean Bards, vol. 1 (Charlottetown, 1898), pp. 192–99. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 18.

33 Turner has Gar an d’fhuair iad a dh’ùine (‘Though they had not enough time’).

39–44 Turner’s version of these lines is different:

<gai>
’S MacLeòid on taoibh elle;
Se mo chreach (cuim’ an ceileam?)
Earra-Ghaidheal seo theirear
Gu là bhàis seo mu dheireadh,
Nach biodh t’ àit’ aig fear eile
Ach cur le chéile gu teiridneach bàidheil.
<eng>

I think this means: “And MacLeod from the other side; / My great regret is (why hide it?) / This Argyll as he’s called / Till this last day of death, / No other replacing you / To pull together with care and respect.” It is interesting that this apparent attack on John, 2nd Duke of Argyll, was dropped from all subsequent editions.

51–53 The sæva indignatio of Turner’s version continues in these lines:

<gai>
Chuidich Eachann cath Ghairbheach
Le cruadal a lanntaibh
Gar nach fuilngear san àm seo a ràdhainn.
<eng>

[TD 392]

(“Hector helped the battle of Harlaw / With the heroism of his swordblades / Though one cannot bear at this time to say it.”) Eachann Ruadh of Duart was killed at Harlaw (1411), cf. the very similar line Chuidich fear dhiubh Cath Gairbheach (‘One of them assisted at the Battle of Harlaw’) in the much earlier poem ‘A’ Chnò Shamhna’, see Colm Ó Baoill (ed.), Eachann Bacach and Other MacLean Poets (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1979), p. 14. A poem to Sir Hector MacLean (d. 1750) in Turner’s collection, p. 110, says of Eachann Ruadh:

<gai>
Bu sheanalair buadhach uasal ainmeil
Eachann ruaineach ruadh nan garbh-chath;
Air son a ghluasaid bha fuath nan Gall ris —
’S gun tug e àr orra ’m blàr Chath Gairbheach!
<eng>

(“Fierce red Hector of the hard-fought battles / Was a noble victorious celebrated general; / For his manoeuvre the Lowlanders loathed him — / How he slaughtered them at the Battle of Harlaw!”)

58 Sir Lachlan MacLean, d. 1649.

60 This line is in Turner only.

62 For Allan of Clanranald see notes on poems 12 and 13.

80 Turner’s and Maclean Sinclair’s reading is athar no màthar ‘on side of father or mother’, see Maclean Sinclair, ‘Who Was Mairearad Nigh’n Lachainn?’, The Celtic Review, vol. 7 (1911), pp. 193–203: 202.

88 The authority for sùil nach robh ceart meaning ‘an evil eye’ (literally ‘an eye that was not right’) is BGh 298.

91 This will be the warrior Ailean nan Sop (c. 1498–1551).

103 Maol Ciarain was a Scottish poet who composed a lament in syllabic metre for his son, Fearchar, who had gone on a bardic circuit to Ireland and was killed there, see BGh 298–99 and Ó Baoill, Eachann Bacach and Other MacLean Poets, p. 239.

159 A line almost identical to this one occurs at OIL 10.

163 Or Gar an ann, as Turner has it – same meaning.

167–72 Turner’s version seems closer to the intimacy of the poet’s world:

<gai>
On là ghabh sibh cead buan
De dh’oighre Dhubhaird nan stuadhan;
Ged tha siud ’na chàs cruaidh oirnn
Os cionn tuigs’ agus smuaintean,
Cha cheist air Dia fhuasgladh
’S e a’ faicinn san uair seo mar thà sinn.
<eng>

(“Since the day you took leave forever / Of the heir of Duart of the billows; / Although that puts us in crisis / Beyond comprehension and thought, / God can easily solve it / As He sees at this time how we are.”) Stuadhan is a play on words: it means ‘gables’ as well as ‘billows’.

[TD 393]

175 Turner here has Gun òl, gun phoit fìona – ‘Without drink, without wine-pot’, or perhaps we should read gun phòit fìona ‘without wine-binge’. The reference is to the lavish funeral which Sir John never received, and it leads the poet seamlessly on, without irony, to speak of his children’s nourishment.

194–99 Turner here gives these lines, in which the MacLeans are addressed in the plural:

<gai>
Gach neach a tha ’g innseadh
Nach robh agaibh d’ur muinntir
’S nach tug sibh ur n-ionndrainn,
Oil air mhath do luchd-diomba,
Do dh’Ì mar ri mhuinntir
’S gum biodh san Innis m’a thimcheall na càirdean.
<eng>

(“Every person who’s saying /You did not have your followers / And did not bring your deceased, / No matter what foes think, / To Iona with his followers / To have his kin in the Island around him.”)

203 The Ealadh is the spot in Iona on which the dead were placed on landing. The same line occurs in another song by Mairearad nighean Lachlainn (Turner’s collection, p. 16, cited with comments in BGh 299).

206–07 Turner here has Far ’m bheil do chàirdean ’nan laighe / Mar ri d’ athair ’s ri d’ sheanair (‘Where your kinsfolk are lying / With your father and grandfather’).

210–18 This stanza, omitted by Watson, is of great interest for its depiction of women’s roles. At line 212 the poet appears to suggest that a widow’s grief cannot be taken for granted unless she is of her husband’s kin-group, i.e. a cousin (’d fhuil dhìreach, literally ‘in your direct blood’).

219–24 Turner has:

<gai>
S mairg a dh’fheuchta ’na fhulang
Mar a dh’éirich e dhuinne:
Gura mithich dhomh sgur dhibh
’S gun bhith tòiseachadh tuille;

(“Pity anyone sentenced / To suffer it as we did: / It’s time I released you / Without starting all over; / It’s around this time last year / I was reaping and harvesting …”)


15. Òran do Raghnall Mac Mhic Ailein

For the poet see poem 10. Although the subject of the song is not specifically named, and it has hitherto been entitled simply ‘Òran do

[TD 394]

Mhac Mhic Ailein’ (‘A Song to Clanranald’), Ó Baoill argues convincingly (Iain Dubh, pp. 57–58) that it is addressed to Ronald, chief of Clanranald, following his departure for France in the summer of 1716 (see poem 13, line 71). The first four lines refer to the splendid court of Ronald’s elder brother and predecessor, Ailean Dearg, at Ormiclate Castle in South Uist, which that ‘nimble-footed lion’ had built for himself c. 1697. All this came to an abrupt end when the Jacobite standard was raised on 6 September 1715 (see notes to poem 22); it may thus be conjectured that the first line refers to August 1715, and that our poem was composed in August 1716. Line 9 states that it is already some time since Ronald’s departure, so this may have taken place as early as May, the first month of summer.

The song is clearly an oral message for transmission to Ronald in France, assuring him of the kindred’s loyalty, reminding him of its strength, and encouraging him to have full regard to his chiefly duties. I take it from Iain Dubh, pp. 30–32. Ó Baoill lists his sources at p. 57 of that book, but see also Ó Baoill and MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 11.

22 See poem 10, note on line 40.

45–48 This presumably refers to the title of ‘Captain’ traditionally borne by Clanranald chiefs. The implication appears to be that the king’s written commission to this effect was given to Ronald by his mother. According to the Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Clan Donald, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1900), p. 253, the first chief on record to describe himself as Captain of Clanranald was Alexander son of Allan (in a bond of manrent dated 20 February 1519). Their view was that the title appeared at this point because Alexander was elected to the chiefship rather than succeeding to it by primogeniture, but that thereafter it meant simply ‘chief’.


16. Dòmhnallan Dubh

This poem is clearly of eighteenth-century origin, judging from the mention of merks (line 19). It appears to relate to South Uist, since Kilaulay (line 39), one of the churches of the medieval parish of Howmore, is at Iochdar in the north-west corner of that island. As it is partly a satire on the wealth and immorality of the Roman Catholic clergy, however, it may well be that its origin lies elsewhere, such as in North Uist; as I have tried to demonstrate at pp. xxxv–xxxix above, the Protestant clergy of the period were not above sanctioning the use of scurrilous verse in the interests of social control.

The poem is equally a satire on that other favourite target of the Protestant establishment, the forces of superstition as represented by healing-women who peddled charms as well as cures – cailleachan,

[TD 395]

sometimes called ‘witches’. The narrator goes to such a woman for advice on male potency – an abiding concern in the history of general practice, as is well demonstrated by the Gaelic medical manuscripts in the National Library of Scotland – and is given a litir or ‘letter’. This is easily explained, since a consecrated charm in writing was known to unofficial medicine as a soisgeal or ‘gospel’ and recalled in recent times in Uist as taking the form of a sealed letter. According to J. L. Campbell, in A Collection of Highland Rites and Customes (The Folklore Society, Cambridge, 1975), p. 68, a young priest in Glencoe, Fr Archibald Chisholm, was baffled by being applied to by about a dozen Protestants during January 1840 for ‘gospels’ to cure various illnesses, and sought the advice of his bishop. In Badenoch in the same period the ‘gospel’ was written on paper which was folded before being given to the sufferer, who must not open it up and look at it or it would lose its effect; ‘it was then sewn up in a part of one’s under-garments, and worn till it crumbled away’. See William Mackenzie, ‘Gaelic Incantations, Charms, and Blessings of the Hebrides’, TGSI 18 (1891-92), pp. 97–182: 152; John Higgitt, The Murthly Hours (London, 2000), p. 344.

A line in a traditional song, ’S i ’g iarraidh léigh am beul gach litreach (‘And she seeking a physician in the mouth of each letter’, i.e. ‘at the beginning of’, or, more likely, ‘inside’ or ‘enclosed with’ each letter), was thought by Campbell to refer to “a custom of persons dispensing charms to cure illnesses to give a letter to sick people. This letter was not to be opened, but was to be put away in a secret place. If it were found and opened, the sick person was liable to get worse.” (Margaret Fay Shaw (ed.), Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist (2nd edn, Oxford, 1977), pp. 247–48. According to Shaw, Campbell was informed about the custom by Miss Annie Campbell, Iochdar, South Uist.) Two examples of such ‘gospels’, both written in English and both for the cure of toothache, are preserved in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, one ‘written and sold in 1855 by a professional witch named Kate McAulay, residing at Kishorn, Lochcarron, Ross-shire’, the other ‘given in 1869 to a domestic servant in Dingwall, by the wife of a gamekeeper at Garve, Ross-shire’, see George F. Black, ‘Scottish Charms and Amulets’, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 27 (1892–93), pp. 433–526: 492.

The conclusion of the poem is that a sensibly varied diet, rather than any regime imposed by a cailleach, is the key to male fertility. I take it from pp. 5–7 of An Leobhar Liath, for which see notes on poem 5.

19 For bogadh see notes on poem 5. By the Treaty of Union in 1707 the value of the merk (13s 4d Scots) was fixed at 13 1/3d sterling. Twenty merks was thus £13 6s 8d Scots, £1 2s 2 2/3d sterling – a substantial amount of money at a time when a mutchkin of ale might be had for twopence, the annual rent on an acre or two of land would be £1, and the annual salary of a Highland schoolmaster could be as little as £12. See poem 44,

[TD 396]

line 55. Twenty merks was precisely the amount borrowed on one occasion in 1739 by the poet Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, see my ‘Mac Mhaighstir Alastair in Rannoch’, TGSI 59 (1994–96), pp. 341–419: 374.

35 This helps underline the status of pepper as a vital commodity which had to be imported to the Highlands. The Pepper Market at Dingwall, for example, dates from at least 1752. Held on the Tuesday before Christmas, it may be seen as a spice market aimed principally at the Christmas dinner-plate. In my ‘Scottish Fairs and Fair-Names’ in Scottish Studies, vol. 33 (1999), pp. 1–75, I pointed out (p. 30) that a ‘pepper fair’ should perhaps be seen as a type rather than merely an individual fair, in the same way as ‘groset fair’, ‘rascal fair’, ‘gingerbread fair’, etc.


17. Laoidh an Tàilleir

Donald MacNicol appears to have been a tailor in Arivean, Glen Lochay, in the parish of Killin, Perthshire. For the role of the tailor in Highland communities see notes on poems 46 and 60. A slightly shorter version of the poem (96 lines) appears under the title ‘An Tailfhear do na Fiannaibh’ in NLS MS 14882 (Rev. Alexander Irvine), ff. 154–157, with this note at f. 156v:

This poem was composed about the year 1715, by a MacNicol, tailor in Arimane, Glenlocha, the same on whom McIntyre made the satirical song. Taken from Angus Stewart, tailor, Bunrannoch’s recitation, who had it from Donald Dewar, tailor, now dead. At Dalchosnie 25th Feby. 1801.


This is a clear, circumstantial but controversial statement. The satirical song referred to is Duncan Ban Macintyre’s splendid ‘Òran don Tàillear’, for which see Angus MacLeod (ed.), The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 90–101. The song is a notorious one. In 1765 or 1766 Donnchadh Bàn (for whom see poems 41 and 49) brought his wife to Lismore and they lived there for months while the Rev. Donald MacNicol wrote down his poems for him, but the two men quarrelled over ‘Òran don Tàillear’, which Donnchadh Bàn wanted to publish with the rest against the minister’s wishes; this delayed publication by over a year, and the first edition of Donnchadh Ban’s songs did not appear until 1768 (Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre, pp. 455–56). The identity of the song is not therefore in doubt; what is uncertain is whether the tailor satirised by Donnchadh Bàn is the author of poem 17, given that the sources for poem 17 describe its author as ‘An Tàillear MacNeacail’ (‘The Tailor MacNicol’), while Donnchadh Bàn addresses his target in his very first line as A Dhòmhnaill Bhàin Mhic O Neachdain (‘Fair-haired Donald Mac

[TD 397]

O’Naughton’), and refers to him later on as an tàillear MacNeachdain (‘the tailor MacNaughton’).

In view of its date and place of origin, Irvine’s information is likely to be reliable. If so, the relevant phrases in Donnchadh Bàn’s satire were originally A Dhòmhnaill Bhàin Mhic O Neacail (‘Fair-haired Donald Mac O’Nicol’) and an tàillear MacNeacail (‘the tailor MacNicol’). The Rev. Donald MacNicol’s objection to the poem would certainly not have been to its composition – the episode that gave rise to it had involved Donnchadh Bàn doing the work of the church by exposing the tailor MacNicol and two of his friends as fornicators and reminding them of the ecclesiastical penalties that awaited them:

<gai>
Sann a thoill e chur air an t-seisean
Mun chleasachd, on chaidh i os n-àird,
’S am brangas a theannadh mu pheirclibh
’S gùn odhar na h-eaglais thoirt dhà.
<eng>

(“He ought to be brought to the session / For transgressing, since word of it’s out, /To have the branks clamped over his jaws / And to wear the dun gown of the church.”) No, the Rev. Donald’s objection would have been to the publication of a poem about a fornicator who bore the same name as himself. The compromise arrived at appears to have been the alteration of MacNeacail to MacNeachdain, after ascertaining (one hopes) that there were no tailors of good repute called Donald MacNaughton.

A lesser difficulty is the fact that whereas ‘Laoidh an Tàilleir’ appears – judging by the mention of Henry at line 100 – to have been composed in 1716, Duncan Ban Macintyre was not even born until 1724, and made the satire on the tailor in 1752. See Henry Mackenzie (ed.), Report … into the Nature and Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian (Edinburgh, 1805), p. 312, where our poem in Adv. MS 72.2.12 was thought to be Macintyre’s.

The scenario which this implies – of a man over 60 being accused of fornication by one of 28 – is neither unlikely nor unfamiliar in this period. The church was getting a grip on the minds of the young; bardic satire was more likely to have an effect on the old. When published in 1751, Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s remarkable ‘Òran nam Bodach’ (‘The Song of the Old Men’) was headed ‘Oran a rinneadh do dha bhodach árraid a bha ann an Ardnomorchuan, a chotharraich iad fein le bhi cur ri striopachas ann an aois an ceithir-fichid bliadhna’ – ‘A song made for two particular old men in Ardnamurchan, who had distinguished themselves by indulging in whoring at the age of eighty’, see Alastair Mac-Dhonuill, Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich (Edinburgh, 1751), p. 123. It was composed c. 1733, when the poet was about 35. Similarly perhaps, at p. 154 of the Ais-Eiridh Alastair accuses a notorious prostitute, the ‘Aigeannach’, of having plied her trade Da fhichid bliaghn’ man heist – ‘For forty years around Heist’, presumably referring to the anchorage at the head of Loch Eishort in Strath, Skye.

[TD 398]

This woman may have been of the sort ‘whom a kirk session considered to be beyond redemption’ (Rosalind Mitchison and Leah Leneman, Girls in Trouble (Edinburgh, 1998), p. 116) and could thus be thrown upon the mercy of the poets.

For these reasons, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the name of the author of our poem was Dòmhnall Bàn MacNeacail.

I take the text from BGh 115–19. Watson’s sources were: NLS Adv. MS 72.2.12, pp. 24–26, written by William MacMurchy; GUL MacLagan MS 60; the transcripts of these two manuscripts in Alexander Cameron, Reliquiæ Celticæ, vol. 1 (Inverness, 1892), pp. 162–63 and 342–44; and John F. Campbell, Leabhar na Féinne (London, 1872, repr. Shannon, 1972), pp. 201–02. Campbell describes the song as:

A tailor’s parody on the Fians, of the Ballads and their domestic and family broils. Composed, as appears from the costume, about 1715 to 1745, when the dress of the Highlanders was to be changed by Act of Parliament, and men wore velvet breeches and cassocks of silk. This is very good. The metre is not the metre of the Ballads, but it is near about it.


Campbell does not of course mean that the average Highlander of the period could afford velvet breeches and silk cassocks! The song is in the humorously hyperbolic spirit of advertising at its best, cf. Angus Y MacLellan’s ‘Am Bùth aig Maitiu’, An Tuil, pp. 86–89. Campbell is right in saying that the poem is a very good parody of Ossianic ballads —songs about the exploits of Fionn, Oscar, Diarmad, Goll mac Morna and so on which were much enjoyed in every eighteenth-century ceilidh-house. As Watson points out (BGh 291–92), the poem’s anachronisms are doubtless intentional, and it is also of historic interest with regard to the Ossianic controversy.

One of the arguments against the authenticity of Macpherson’s “Ossianic” poems was that in them the two great cycles of heroic tales are mixed up, so that Cuchullin of the Craobhruadh cycle appears alongside of Fionn (Macpherson’s Fingal), who lived 250 years later. Here we find this very confusion before Macpherson’s time. It does not, however, occur in the older literature.

2 Fionn belonged to the Clanna Baoisgne, and his chief seat was in Almu, Almhu, now the Hill of Allen in Leinster.

6 Goll, for whom see also lines 53–56 and poem 20, note on lines 25–32, was the leading warrior of the Clann Morna of Connacht, and was frequently in opposition to Fionn, see for example Neil Ross, Heroic Poetry from the Book of the Dean of Lismore (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1939), pp. 60–69.

[TD 399]

7 Irvine here has Cha lugha leam na gìni e, which means effectively the same but is more rhythmical.

17 Presumably a reference to Cù Chulainn’s mansion at Dùn Dealgan (Dundalk).

54 Bricin is probably a reminiscence of Bricriu ‘of the poisoned tongue’, a mischief-making poet of the Cù Chulainn sagas. Brian Boru, King of Ireland, was killed at Clontarf, 1014.

62 Conan, of the Clann Morna, is often represented as an impetuous brawler as well as a good warrior, see poem 4, note on line 65.

81–84 The MacDiarmids of Glen Lochay. John MacDiarmid, who lived in Glen Lyon about the end of the eighteenth century, was known as the Baron MacDiarmid. See John Macdiarmid, ‘Folklore of Breadalbane’, TGSI 26 (1904–07), pp. 136–56: 156; BGh 292.

85 The first edition of BGh (p. 118) gives this line as No a bheil iad anns na cathaibh . . ? ‘Or are they in the battles . . ?’ This, as Watson suggests (2nd edn, p. 294; 3rd edn, p. 296), is a way of referring to death in battle. See poem 20, note on line 12.

93 ‘O companions of the Devil’, literally – an Donas, the Devil.

99–100 BGh has Cuiridh litir Mhàrr g’ar sireadh / Is gu Diùc o Bearrag is Eanruig (‘Send Mar’s letter to seek us / And to the Duke of Berwick and Henry’). I have made use of MacMurchy’s reading in NLS Adv. MS 72.2.12, which (except for his final words seacht senruic) makes more sense. The Duke of Berwick was the natural son of James II and half-brother to the ‘Old Pretender’, whose cause he supported for a time. A celebrated general, he was killed in 1734 while besieging Philipsburg on the Rhine. ‘Henry’ will be Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke (1678–1751), the Pretender’s Secretary of State 1714–16. Perhaps seacht senruic is for seach Eanraig ‘rather than Henry’, an emendation reflecting Bolingbroke’s dismissal.


18. An Tánaiste Tais

The subject of this elegy is James, second son of Donald MacDonald of Benbecula. His father became 16th chief of Clanranald in 1725. His mother (whom his father had married after the death of his first wife, Janet, a daughter of Dòmhnall Dubh na Cuthaige, 13th chief of Clanranald, for whom see poem 12, note on line 11) was Margaret, daughter of George MacKenzie, 1st of Kildun. James was educated in France and died unmarried in 1719, see Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Clan Donald, vol. 3 (Inverness, 1904), p. 234. The date of his death is stated very clearly in lines 97–98.

The language of the poem is not basically vernacular Scottish Gaelic at all but Classical Gaelic, otherwise known as Early Modern Irish, an

[TD 400]

artificial dialect coined in Ireland c. AD 1200 and used down to our period in Scotland by hereditary learned poets and physicians. The poem’s entire style and atmosphere is classical, and it is surely no accident that its subject is a scholarly young man. We do not know whether the poet, whoever he was, expected a reward for it from the dead man’s father, or whether he was simply fulfilling the terms of his tack of Stilligarry and/or Drimisdale (see notes on poem 12).

The metre may be described as brúilingeacht of rannaigheacht dialtach mhór, that is to say a ‘loose form’ of ‘great one-syllabled versification’, see BGh xxxix. In other words, both language and metre are heavily influenced by the vernacular. It is not a song but a poem, and was not sung but chanted. In strict rannaigheacht dialtach mhór each line has seven syllables and ends in a monosyllable, the last word of the second line of each verse rhymes with the last word in the fourth, there are two additional rhymes linking each couplet, there is alliteration between two stressed words in each line (in the case of the fourth line, the last two stressed words), and, in contrast with poems in the vernacular, rhyme is based on consonants as well as on vowels. All of these features are to be found in the present poem, but none of them consistently – as far as it is represented here, the classical tradition is clearly in decline. In addition, the mutational system is haywire, and the particle do is indiscriminately dropped, e.g. in lines 7, 8 and 24.

I take the poem from pp. 254–60 of the Little Book of Clanranald (MCR 39 in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh), where the hand is one which I have tentatively suggested may be that of Lachlann, son of Niall MacMhuirich (see notes on poem 38), and from NLS Adv. MS 72.2.2, f. 32, where the hand is that of Lachlann’s elder brother Domhnall. The date ‘Septbr: ye 8th 1727’ is written very clearly by the scribe at the end of the poem in MCR 39. Lines 1–12, 45–76 and 85–92 are in MCR 39 only, the rest are in both. The Rev. Dr Alexander Cameron’s draft transcript and translation of the poem from MCR 39 are in his Reliquiæ Celticæ, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1894), pp. 274–81. There is a translation of lines 81–104 by the Irish scholar Owen Connellan (1800–69) in NLS Adv. MS 73.1.16, f. 123r.

Rather than attempt to restore the text to classical norms (as I have done in the case of the much shorter poem 38), I have chosen to leave the spelling exactly as in the manuscripts. I have, however, supplied punctuation, capitalisation and word-spacing as appropriate. In the small number of instances where there is a clear difference in spelling between the two sources, I have given that of Adv. MS 72.2.2. However, some MCR 39 readings shed extra light on the meaning of the text – ttrialluig for trialladh at line 15, cainnt for cceinn at line 22, liomhadh for liamadh (which sounds like South Uist dialect to me) at line 24, and sed for sedh at line 42. Both cainnt and colaisde (coláiste, line 17), which is a late Romance loanword, are unusual in classical verse. An edition of the Little Book (and its companion, the so-called ‘Black Book’, MCR 40) is being prepared by Professor William Gillies and is eagerly awaited.

[TD 401]

Since the MCR 39 text provides most (though not all) of the better and more classical readings, whoever wrote it is likely to be the author of our poem. Unfortunately my identification of its scribe as Lachlann son of Niall MacMhuirich is mere guesswork. The identification of the scribe of the Adv. MS 72.2.2 text as Lachlann’s brother Domhnall is, I think, beyond doubt. Two words in the text, chlos (line 8) and aobhacht (line 34), are highly characteristic of the writings of Domhnall MacMhuirich, however, and I think therefore that the safest speculation regarding the authorship of our poem is that it may be by either of the brothers. It could of course be by both – or neither!

I take the title from line 27. ‘Tanist’ is usually defined in English as a chief’s heir elect (Tánaiste today is the title of the deputy prime minister of Ireland), but I use the word here in its alternative Scottish Gaelic sense of a second son or heir presumptive. I am grateful to the trustees of the National Museums of Scotland and of the National Library of Scotland for their kind permission to reproduce the text.

37 The word noch will be for nochan, vernacular chan.

38 MCR 39 here has ’S nach leir ach(?) ionadh da fhios, which means the same but is metrically a little better (fhéad : léir).

40 Keening was traditionally accompanied by the clapping and rubbing of palms until blood flowed. The custom was becoming obsolete by our period, but even in 1747 Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat (1675x76–1747), predicted that it would be seen at his funeral: “There will be crying and clapping of hands for I am one of the greatest chiefs in the Highlands.” See Moray McLaren, Lord Lovat of the ’45 (London, 1957), p. 223.

51 These ancestors (Colla Uais and Conn Ceudchathach) recall the MacDonalds’ Irish origins (see Niall MacMhuirich’s Clanranald history in Reliquiæ Celticæ 2, pp. 150–53).

53 Ronald of Benbecula, who died in 1679, see The Clan Donald 3, p. 279.

54 Metre and rhyme dictate that we should read da chur a ccomnuigh a n-uaigh (úir ‘soil, ground’, uaigh ‘grave’).

60 This could be a reference to the ‘Old Pretender’, or to James’s uncle Ronald (chief of Clanranald 1715–25, also in exile at St Germains), or indeed to both.

69–72 Unusually for classical verse, the sense in this stanza continues unbroken from start to finish. The word which I have chosen to translate as ‘patrician’ is geal – ‘a white one’, referring to his skin.

74 The spelling raime must be for réime, cf. rhyme with méinne.

81–82 Cladh Mhoire, St Mary’s Churchyard, is at Nunton in Benbecula. James’s grandfather, Ronald, had been buried there in 1679, and his father, Donald, was to be buried there in 1730, see The Clan Donald 2, p. 350, and 3, p. 234. The reading in MCR 39 is the classically correct A gCladh Muire, as in Irish. Our Cladh Mhoire is a Scottish vernacularism, and is exactly

[TD 402]

what St Mary’s is called in Benbecula today. Both sources have Muire at line 99, however.

93 The MCR 39 reading of this line is Od-chi n-eiseirigh an luain. For Od-chi read ód-chiú, ‘I see’. A process of gradual vernacularisation is evident here. The MCR 39 version is close to the classical Ód-chiú a n-aiséirghe an luain (literally ‘I see in the resurrection of the judgement’), whereas it would be easier to regularise the Adv. MS 72.2.2 version into the vernacular Chì san aiseirigh là luain (‘[I] see in the resurrection on judgement day’).

97–98 Cf. poem 13, lines 2–3, and poem 59, lines 145–46.

104 In the tradition of classical verse, the poem ends on the syllable with which it began.


19. Trodan ris an Fheòil

John MacLean (Iain mac Ailein, c. 1660 – 1741), from Mull, was a great-grandson of the sixth chief of the MacLeans of Ardgour. Johnson and Boswell, who visited Mull in October 1773, both give short accounts of him (cited below). Although both say that he was illiterate, there is every sign in his work that he was well acquainted with the more learned aspects of Gaelic tradition. He bore the title Aos-Dàna, which appears to have been reserved for family poets of high status, and may well have indicated the ability to read and write; it was also held by Iain Dubh and Murdoch Matheson (see poems 10, 22).

In the Eigg collection of 1776 our poem is headed ‘Oran a roinn Eon Mc Gilleon do dhios Inghin Dhoniùl mhic Doniùl duibh’ (‘A Song made by John MacLean for two daughters of Donald son of Mac Dhòmhnaill Dhuibh’), while the heading in SO is ‘Còmhradh, mar gu’m b’ann eadar dithis nighean Mhic-Dhòmhnuill Duibh’ (‘A Dialogue, supposed to be between two daughters of Mac Dhòmhnaill Dhuibh’). Line 1 confirms that the name of the girls’ father was Donald. As Mac Dhòmhnaill Dhuibh is the by-name of Cameron of Lochiel, and there was no Cameron of Lochiel called Donald during the poet’s lifetime, it is clear that the song is addressed to two girls whose father’s name was Donald and whose paternal grandfather was the Cameron chief. The only candidate during the poet’s floruit appears to be Donald (c. 1665-1748), second son of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel by his first wife, Isobel, daughter of Sir Lachlan MacLean of Duart. A professional soldier, Donald fought for General Mackay against his father at Killiecrankie in 1689, appears as a captain in the Scots Brigade in Holland in 1693, and is described in his testament as a major of General Murray’s Regiment, see John Stewart of Ardvorlich, The Camerons (Glasgow, 1971), pp. 54, 81, 86, 88. With regard to his offspring, Stewart speaks only (p. 83) of ‘Major Donald, whose lawful daughter Robina married Robert MacGregor alias Murray of Glencarnock’. We may perhaps conclude that Margaret and Marjory are a product of the kind of relationship

[TD 403]

described in poem 3 – that they are illegitimate daughters, being brought up by their MacLean mother in or near Mull – and that the song was composed between 1710 and 1730.

On 15 October 1773, in the house of Dr Alexander MacLean at Tobermory in Mull, James Boswell recorded:

Miss McLean produced some Erse poems by John McLean, who was a famous bard in Mull, and had died only a few years ago. He could neither read nor write. She read and translated two of them; one, a kind of elegy on Sir John McLean’s being obliged to fly his country in 1715; another, a dialogue between two Roman Catholick young ladies, sisters, whether it was better to be a nun or to marry. I could not perceive much poetical imagery in the translation. Yet all of our company who understood Erse, seemed charmed with the original. There may, perhaps, be some choice of expression, and some excellence of arrangement, that cannot be shewn in translation. After we had exhausted the Erse poems, of which Dr Johnson said nothing, Miss McLean gave us several tunes on a spinnet. (Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), pp. 352–53)


Dr Johnson may have said nothing, but he wrote this (pp. 117, 132):

There has lately been in the Islands one of these illiterate poets, who hearing the Bible read at church, is said to have turned the sacred history into verse. I heard part of a dialogue, composed by him, translated by a young lady in Mull, and thought it had more meaning than I expected from a man totally uneducated; but he had some opportunities of knowledge; he lived among a learned people … Miss Maclean, who was born, and had been bred at Glasgow, having removed with her father to Mull, added to other qualifications, a great knowledge of the Earse language, which she had not learned in her childhood, but gained by study, and was the only interpreter of Earse poetry that I could ever find.


Whatever the merits or demerits of my own translation, the dilemma of the girls in the song (and their elegant resolution of it) is very much a topic for the present day, particularly in view of the evidence that their mother is likely to have been a single parent. They also epitomise for us two abiding themes in the Gaelic poetry of their time – the rural idyll which is invariably conjured up in women’s love-songs (lines 23–24) and the ‘bride of Christ’ visualised in religious verse (lines 87–88).

I take the poem from SO 393–94, but have incorporated one or two better readings from the Eigg collection of 1776, pp. 175–78. The Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair offers a substantially different version in Na Baird Leathanach: The Maclean Bards, vol. 1 (Charlottetown, 1898), pp. 85–89. My text is far from definitive, as the poem contains a number of interesting cruxes which can only be resolved by careful study of all available sources, for which see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p.

[TD 404]

17. John Mackenzie says (SO 393) that it is sung to the tune of ‘Tha ’n Oidhche Nochd ro Aonarach’; I take the title from line 54.

14 The Eigg reading Ris a mhac sin Echin òig and the SO reading Ri mhac sin Eachuinn òig both seem ungrammatical to me. Maclean Sinclair resolved the difficulty as Ri mac mhic Eachainn Oig (‘With the grandson of Eachann Òg’). I believe however that the Eigg and SO readings resulted from an assumption that mac here meant ‘son’ rather than ‘boy’ (cf. poem 34, line 56), and I have emended accordingly.

27 Eigg reads Gur truagh an appre hension duit (‘Sad is your apprehension’), breaking the English word to show stress and rhyme with àrach.

29–32 At line 29 SO has sgeòil (‘stories’), probably because Eigg has sgela, which could be interpreted as plural. Maclean Sinclair gives:

<gai>
Gabh fhéin sgeul an easbaig
Th’ air ar creideamh-ne mar cheann
Dh’fheuch an sine ’n t-òrdagh seo
Na ’m pòsadh a bhith ann.
<eng>

(“Just take the story of the bishop / Who’s the head of our religion / To see if this institution / Isn’t older than marriage.”) The overall meaning is quite clear, but I have no idea what bishop is meant or to what story of episcopal incontinence Marjory is referring. If we are to assume with Boswell that the sisters were Roman Catholics, the bishop in question may be St Peter. Possibly then the story or stories have to do with St Peter expressing liberal views in debate with St Paul. At line 78 Marjory expresses distaste for spending time in prayer to either of these saints, preferring good works instead.

33 Or ga chleachdadh (‘practised’), as Maclean Sinclair has it.

35–36 Maclean Sinclair gives:

<gai>
Nach faigh thu anns a’ Bhìoball
Ged se friamh gach fìrinn’ à.
<eng>

(“Which you won’t find in the Bible / Though it’s the root of all that’s true.”)

46 The word pasmann is from Lowland Scots passment, ‘stripes of gold or silver lace or silk braid used as decorative trimming’, see Colm Ó Baoill (ed.), Eachann Bacach and Other Maclean Poets (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1979), p. 185.

81–82 Eigg and SO give An t-àite taisge diamhair (same meaning), but I have reversed the order of the adjectives to provide aicill rhyme taisge : ulaidh. As usual, Maclean Sinclair rationalises differently – he gives:

[TD 405]

<gai>
Is àite-gléidhte dìomhain
San do chuir thu t’ uile stòr.
<eng>

(“It’s in a vain place of keeping / That you have put all your store.”) There may be an element of bowdlerisation in his version.

89–96 Once again Maclean Sinclair gives an interesting version which is skewed in a more spiritual direction:

<gai>
Bha gach neach on tàinig sinn
Glé stàthail ’nan àm fhéin,
Cha bu luchd thoirt dàlach iad
A bhàrd no dhàimh no dh’éisg;
Bu mheasail ri àm nàistinn iad,
An nàire riamh do ghléidh —
Chan iarrainn fhéin a dh’àilgheas
Ach bhith san àit’ ’sam bi iad fhéin.
<eng>

(“All the people we’re descended from / Gave great service in their time, / No poet, poet-band or satirist / Was ever made by them to wait; / They got respect in time of caring, / Their honour they always kept — / I would seek no privilege / But to be where they will be.”)

99 I prefer the SO reading. For once, Eigg and Maclean Sinclair agree: they both have Far am bi na càirdean (‘Where the kinsfolk will be’). I do not think, however, that this materially alters the poem’s interesting conclusion.


20. Alastair á Gleanna Garadh

For the poet see poem 6. Mackenzie says (SO 58): “The song Alasdair a Glinne-Garadh is truly beautiful, and has served as a model for many Gaelic songs.” He is right. It represents the conventions of the ‘panegyric code’ at their most lyrical, and is especially remarkable for its deployment of kennings, see pp. xxiii–xxiv and 527.

Alastair Dubh, 11th of Glengarry, first appears on historical record as his father’s heir when he leads his kindred to battle at Killiecrankie in 1689. He appears to have succeeded to the chiefship in 1705. He fought at Sheriffmuir on the victorious right wing of the Jacobite army, and it has been said that when the beloved Ailean Dearg of Clanranald (for whom see poems 11, 12 and 13) fell mortally wounded (see line 12), Alastair Dubh encouraged the faltering MacDonalds by raising his bonnet and crying out: Buillean an-diugh, tuiream a-màireach! (“Blows today, mourning tomorrow!”)

Alastair’s remaining years after the failure of the ’15 were troubled. He surrendered and received a pardon, Duncan Forbes of Culloden commenting that ‘this instance of the Court being imposed on … to

[TD 406]

grant a remission to the worthlessest rogue living, is no small mortification to the lovers of the Constitution’. Despite this, his lands were plundered and his castle at Invergarry, which had been occupied by the authorities in any case for most of the years since 1689, was burnt down. General Wade decided to build a replacement barracks a few miles away at Kilcumin, and this was duly erected as Fort Augustus. He played a difficult role during the rising of 1719, remaining outwardly loyal to the Hanoverian government while covertly supporting the Jacobites – 150 of his Glengarry men fought for King James in the disastrous battle of Glenshiel under the command of his nephew Dòmhnall Gorm and John MacDonell of Shian, following which he was subjected to much official harassment.

There is considerable discussion in BSC 163–64 as to whether the death of Alastair Dubh took place in 1721 or 1724, but it is noticeable that more recent scholarship on the subject comes down in favour of 28 October 1721. Our lines 9–10 are also highly suggestive of the earlier date (see note on these lines below). Our poem may therefore be safely regarded as dating from the last two months of 1721.

In view of the extraordinary praise lavished upon him by Sìleas na Ceapaich, it is of particular interest to note what others have had to say about Alastair Dubh. The authors of The Clan Donald describe him as “one of the most picturesque and striking personalities in the whole history of his race. Of towering stature and undaunted courage, he was one of the most celebrated warriors of his age, while his high talents and generous disposition commended him to the respect and affection of his clan.” They also quote the more interesting and impartial judgement of MacGregor of Balhaldie. “He was loyal and wonderfully sagacious and long-sighted, and was possessed of a great many shining qualities, stained with a few vices, which, like patches on a beautiful face, seemed to give more eclat to his character.” More curious still are the views that “it’s hard to say whither he has more of the bear, the lyon, or the fox in him, for he is at least as ruff and cunning as he is bold … more of a politician than an open frank, and sincere neighbour; with his superiors and equals he lived in constant emulation and jealousy …” See Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Clan Donald, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1900), pp. 450–60, and Norman H. MacDonald, The Clan Ranald of Knoydart and Glengarry (Edinburgh, 1979), pp. 63–76.

I take the song from BGh 128–30. Watson’s sources were the Eigg collection of 1776 (pp. 286–88), SO 59–60, and NLS Adv. MS 72.2.15 (end A), p. 8, written c. 1750 by William MacMurchy from Kintyre (c. 1700 – c. 1778). For his second edition (Glasgow, 1932) Watson took our lines 65–68 (missing in those sources) from a version recovered in ‘the gloomy woods of America’, see Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair, ‘Old Gaelic Songs’, TGSI 20 (1894–96), pp. 9–28: 19. A somewhat different version of the poem, based mainly on four more eighteenth-century manuscripts, is published (with translation) in BSC 70–75, with notes at pp. 163–65. For a complete source-list see BSC

[TD 407]

201–05, for some of the poem’s previous titles see BSC 202, and for the tune see BSC 240–41.

9–10 Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat (Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh) died in 1718, and Sir Donald, his son and successor, in September 1719. He was succeeded by his father’s brother, Sir James, who died in December 1720.

12 A way of saying that a man was killed in battle, see poem 17, note on line 85.

13–16 In Ó Baoill’s opinion (BSC 165) these lines probably refer to Ailean Dearg rather than to Alastair Dubh.

25–32 This difficult and deliberately ambiguous stanza is likely to be the key to the poem. It has been discussed by Watson in BGh 296, by Sorley MacLean in Ris a’ Bhruthaich: The Criticism and Prose Writings of Sorley MacLean (ed. William Gillies, Stornoway, 1985), pp. 246–47, and by Ó Baoill in BSC 165. Ó Baoill confuses the picture slightly by using in his definitive text the reading Dhòmhnall for Gholl. Dhòmhnall occurs in only one source, Adv. MS 72.2.15, and may safely be rejected on grounds of rhyme. Sìleas was in a position to make a political statement with little fear of reprisal, and it sounds to me as if she is replying to some other poet who had likened the leaders of the ’15 to the troublesome warrior Goll mac Morna, for whom see poem 17, lines 6, 53–56. I have examined the other poems to Alastair Dubh listed in BSC 164 and have regrettably failed to find any mention of Goll. I think it is unhelpful to see the ship as the literal one which carried the Old Pretender away in February 1716 – it is much more likely to be the Jacobite ‘ship of state’, although the metaphor may well have been suggested by the Pretender’s ships. I would ‘read’ the stanza like this: “Had Jacobite leaders such as Seaforth (see poem 22) been as self-serving as you say (line 25) in 1715 (line 26), they would not have made a second attempt in 1719 (line 27) despite the extraordinary collapse (line 28) which left you in 1716 (line 29) at the enemy’s mercy (lines 30), so disillusioned (line 31) that you sickened and died five years later (line 32).” Having said her piece, as it were, Sìleas, with great good taste, then sweeps controversy aside with a sustained rhetorical flourish (lines 33–56) as dramatic as any in Gaelic literature.

55 Watson claims (BGh 297) that leamhan here is the lime tree, whose wood is soft, rather than the elm.

60 The reference is to the untimely death of the poet’s husband in 1720 (BSC xlix–l) and her own widowhood.

[TD 408]

21. Crosanachd Fhir nan Druimnean

For the poet see poem 19. Dating apparently from 1731 (see note on lines 86–90), our poem is a crosanachd, that is, a satire consisting of verse in snéadhbhairdne (‘swift metre’) alternating with prose. The crosanachd mode (Irish crosántacht) is medieval in origin. The first role of a crosán was to carry the cross in religious processions, but the term was later applied to strolling minstrels (the cliar chrosán or ‘troupe of cross-carriers’) whose performances seem to have involved elements of praise in snéadhbhairdne, interspersed with satire in prose and accompanied by raucous music on the bagpipe, no doubt with dancing, miming and improvisation thrown in. The mode achieved great popularity in Ireland and Scotland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see Introduction, p. xxx), and was practised very elegantly in Classical Gaelic by Cathal MacMhuirich (c. 1600 – c. 1650).

In terms of classical verse, snéadhbhairdne consisted of alternating lines of eight and four (or three) syllables with fairly minimal rhyme and alliteration. In vernacular terms it settled down roughly into four-line stanzas of alternating long and short lines. With two long lines added at the beginning, it is the so-called ‘Standard Habbie’ of Lowland Scotland, named after the town piper of Kilbarchan and much used by Ramsay, Fergusson and Burns, see my paper ‘The Genius of Cathal MacMhuirich’, TGSI 50 (1976–78) 327–66: 335, 363.

He was convoyer of the bride,
With Kittock hinging at his side:
About the kirk he thought a pride
The ring to lead.
But now we may gae but a guide,
For Habbie’s dead.

In vernacular Scottish Gaelic, just as in Lowland Scots, the mode became subject to reinterpretation – snéadhbhairdne might appear without prose or without satirical associations, for example, or the verse mingled with the prose might be in some other metre, or the term crosanachd might be applied to other types of verse or music – but crosanachd survived as defined above until late in the eighteenth century. See also poems 37 and 39. This is not the place for a complete list of Scottish examples, but references will be found in ‘The Genius of Cathal MacMhuirich’, pp. 335–37 and 362–63, and in Alan Harrison, An Chrosántacht (Dublin, 1979), pp. 98–101. For other poems in snéadhbhairdne see BGh xlii. ‘Marbhrann Bhaltair’, a crosanachd ascribed to Murdoch Matheson (for whom see poem 22), will be found in John Mackenzie (ed.), An t-Aosdàna (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 80–86, and in William Matheson, ‘Further Gleanings from the Dornie Manuscripts’, TGSI 45 (1967–68), pp. 148–95: 172–77. Possibly the last crosanachd to be composed in the full traditional style is ‘Baran Supair’, an uproariously comical satire by John Bethune which dates

[TD 409]

from the 1770s. It tells how the young James Maxwell (d. 1829), a Campbeltown lawyer who was to become the Duke of Argyll’s factor for Mull and Morvern in 1787 (and father-in-law to the celebrated Victorian writer Caraid nan Gaidheal, the Rev. Norman MacLeod) defecated catastrophically in his breeches when sitting in a boat next to the Duchess of Argyll. It was published in John Gillies, The History of the Feuds and Conflicts among the Clans … to which is added, A Collection of Curious Songs in the Gallic Language (Glasgow, 1780), pp. 101–06, and has been edited by Michael Ranauro, ‘Baran Supair’, MA dissertation, Dept of Celtic, University of Edinburgh, 1994.

Our poem is equally characteristic of the mode at its best. Its subject is Charles MacLean, laird of Drimnin in Morvern. Shortly after the Earl of Argyll seized the MacLean lands in Mull and Morvern in the 1680s, the barony of Drimnin was bought from him by Charles MacLean’s forebear, also Charles, who was tacksman of Ardnacross in Mull. When a young man our Charles spent some time on a warship. On one occasion he punched no less a person than MacLeod of Dunvegan on the street in Edinburgh. He was married, with four sons and some daughters, and employed a tutor to educate them. One day he sent this man to fetch a pair of shoes from the shoemaker. The shoemaker said he had not been paid for the last pair of shoes he had made him This the tutor reported back to the laird. Charles dragged him back to the shoemaker, who swore that he had never said such a thing. This suited Charles very well. Seizing the tutor, he lifted up his kilt and assaulted him with the shoemaker’s belt.

This caused considerable scandal. Iain mac Ailein made no less than three other poems on the same theme: ‘Cléirsinneachd Fhir nan Druimnean’ (‘The Schoolmastering of the Laird of Drimnin’), ‘Turragan Fhir nan Druimnean’ (‘The Misadventures of the Laird of Drimnin’), and a single ‘Rann’ (‘Verse’) which pithily sums it all up. The poet appeared to see his task – a task which gives us some insight into his role of Aos-Dàna – as finding a balance between expressing public outrage and safeguarding the dignity of Drimnin’s status, and at line 81 he issues a threat. It is not exactly a physical one, but a warning to Drimnin that if he does not modify his behaviour he will have to suffer the full ridicule of bardic satire.

The ultimate fate of Charles MacLean was violent but curiously honourable. He died in 1746 fighting for Prince Charles at Culloden. John Mackenzie tells us in Eachdraidh a’ Phrionnsa (2nd edn, Paisley, 1906), pp. 131–32:

<gai>
’Nuair a bha Mac ’Illeain nan Drumainnean air tì teicheadh le bheath as an àraich, chunnaic e dìthis dheth a chuid mac air an leòn, agus chaidh, innse dha gun robh an treas fear na laidhe marbh air a bhlàr. “Cha bhi sin gun dioladh” ars a fear nan Drumainnean, agus ged a bha’n t-uasal so cho aosda is nach robh ròine fuilt air a cheann, ruith e air ais thun na h-àraich, mharbh e aon trùpair agus leòn e fear eile, ach ann an tiotadh a’n deighe sin thuit e-féin gu’n eiridh tuilleadh le lainn thrì trùpairean sàite na Chorp.

(“When MacLean of Drimnin was about to flee the slaughter with his life, he saw two of his sons wounded, and was told that the third was lying dead on the field. ‘That won’t go unrevenged,’ said the laird of Drimnin, and although this noble man was so old that he had not one hair on his head, he ran back to the slaughter, killed one trooper and wounded another, but fell for the last time a moment later with three troopers’ blades thrust into his body.”)


I take the poem from pp. 430–32 of the Stewart collection of 1804 and from SO 74–75, where it is wrongly ascribed to Iain Dubh mac Iain mhic Ailein (see poem 10). Lines 1–51 are also in two of the Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair’s collections, Comhchruinneachadh Ghlinn-a-Bhaird: The Glenbard Collection of Gaelic Poetry (Charlottetown, 1890), pp. 89–93, and Na Baird Leathanach: The Maclean Bards, vol. 1 (Charlottetown, 1898), pp. 152–55. These provide one or two better readings. Sinclair presumably left out lines 52–90 because they offended his sensibilities; in both collections, however, he also prints the other three poems on the same theme. My biographical information is taken from Sinclair’s The Clan Gillean (Charlottetown, 1899), pp. 437–38, and from the notes accompanying the poem in his two collections. See also my article ‘There’s a New Fad in MacLean Lands’, WHFP, 25 August 2000.

In addition, Alan Harrison discusses our poem in two studies of the crosanachd mode. In An Chrosántacht (Dublin, 1979), pp. 97–98 and 120–23, he presents a full edition. In The Irish Trickster (The Folklore Society, Sheffield, 1989), pp. 68–70, he offers an English translation, describing the poem (p. 68) as ‘overflowing with ironic satire, a sense of fun and a kind of sexual double entendre that are also often part and parcel of … popular customs’. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 17.

1 For a discussion of the name an Dreòllainn see Colm Ó Baoill, Eachann Bacach and Other Maclean Poets (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1979), pp. 233–34. Since Drimnin is not in Mull but in Morvern, it seems clear to me that the term was a convenient one to denote the MacLean lands in general rather than the isle of Mull in particular. See also poem 10, line 65.

4 Large numbers of schools were being established in the Highlands and Islands at this period, not only parish schools as legislated for by Act of Parliament but also charity schools set up by the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (founded 1709), see notes on poems 24 and 45. Such schools made considerable use of corporal punishment. Dr Johnson remarked when told of the pious Lady Errol, who did not use force or fear in educating her children:

Sir, she is wrong; I would rather have the rod to be the general terror to all, to make them learn, than tell a child, if you do thus

[TD 411]

or thus, you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters. The rod produces an effect which terminates itself. A child is afraid of being whipped, and gets his task, and there’s an end on’t; whereas, by exciting emulation, and comparisons of superiority, you lay the foundation of lasting mischief; you make brothers and sisters hate each other. (Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), p. 211)


Corporal punishment was by no means unknown in the Highlands and Islands before the arrival of formal education, see e.g. Alexander Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 154, 192, 289. What was likely to be new to many ordinary Highland people at this period was the idea that a complete stranger could enter the community and brutalise their children in the interests of teaching them English, arithmetic and the Catechism. A little later in the century, Lachlan MacPherson of Strathmashie (for whom see poem 40) placed some damning words in the mouth of a schoolmaster in the middle of an otherwise cheerful song about how the poet had turned up uninvited at a wedding (SO 263).

<gai>
Thuirt am maighistir sgoile liath,
“Mas e gleus-air-mhàs a mhiann,
Mo roghainn-s’ e thar seachd ciad —
Si ’cheàird bha riamh cur ann domh.”
<eng>

(“Said the grey-haired dominie, / ‘If he wants his buttocks spanked, / I’d choose him over seven hundred — / It’s the job I’ve always loved.’”)

22, 25 The word sanntach, which I have translated ‘lusty’, can mean anything from ‘ambitious’ through ‘greedy’ to ‘lustful’. The poet uses it in a double context – that of his jest about Charles’s ambition to take over the role of schoolmaster, and that of his evident concerns about sexual deviance.

32 According to legend, when the people of Cill Mo Cheallaig found a man leading a horse and cart carrying a stolen cow, they hanged the horse for stealing the cow. See SO 38; J. F. Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, vol. 2 (2nd edn, Paisley, 1890, repr. Hounslow, 1983), pp. 388–403; OIL 283–84; and my articles ‘The Law of Kilmachellaig’ (WHFP, 16 and 30 August 1996).

42–43 This is the Stewarts’ reading. The SO reading is Le crios féilidh (‘With a kilt belt’). Sinclair’s two collections give le stràcaibh / De chrios léiridh (‘with strokes / Of a punishment belt’).

44–51 This prose section is of great interest. The sentence with which it begins shows that the crosanachd was performed as a duet. It goes on to convey reflections on the new educational methods

[TD 412]

by a major poet who, thanks to the efforts of people like him, could see ancient tradition, new songs, real knowledge and sound principles being passed on effortlessly to old and young alike every winter’s night in the ceilidh-house without the slightest recourse to corporal punishment.

82 James Campbell of Stonefield, Sheriff Depute of Argyll, the principal legal officer and man of business in the county.

86–90 In the spirit of crosanachd this sounds racy, but, as Dr Dòmhnall Uilleam Stiùbhart has pointed out to me, it refers to a serious business matter. The ‘Spanish lady’ is the galleon which sank in Tobermory harbour, opposite Drimnin, in 1588. All salvage rights – assumed to be extremely valuable – were the property of James Campbell’s superior, the Duke of Argyll. During 1729–31 the wreck was explored with a diving bell by an English engineer, Capt. Jacob Rowe, his operations being financed by the Duke of Argyll and Alexander MacKenzie of Delvine. Despite causing considerable damage to the wreck, Rowe found no treasure whatever. His investors lost their money, and Delvine was sued. See Alison McLeay, The Tobermory Treasure: The True Story of a Fabulous Armada Galleon (London, 1986), pp. 48–65. James Campbell seems to have died in 1731, see Ian G. Lindsay and Mary Cosh, Inveraray and the Dukes of Argyll (Edinburgh, 1973), p. 373.


22. Moladh Chabair Féidh

This poem has a complex history which may be summarised as follows. Originally conceived in 1716, it consists of a very fine tune and three elements: praise of William MacKenzie (Uilleam Dubh), 5th Earl and Marquis of Seaforth; a ‘gathering of the clans’ of the type suggested by poem 10 above; and a satirical account of the ‘Alness affair’ of October 1715, in which a Whig force of 1,500 men under the Earl of Sutherland was dispersed without shedding of blood by a 3,000-strong Jacobite force under Uilleam Dubh. In a very different but incomplete version of the song preserved in the MacLagan collection and published by Professor Angus Matheson in Gairm 10, pp. 128–29 (the ‘short version’), serious political critique takes the place of satire and the ‘Alness affair’ is not mentioned. In neither surviving version is the ‘gathering of the clans’ strongly to the fore, but its previous existence is strongly suggested by the song ‘Dìomoladh Chabair Féidh’ (‘The Dispraise of Cabar Féidh’) by Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, for whom see notes on poem 24.

Sources for the authorship of the poem are very evenly split between the advocates of Murdoch Matheson from Kintail (c. 1670 – c. 1757), Seaforth’s family poet, and Norman MacLeod (Tormod Bàn) from Lochbroom (fl. 1716–44), a maker of popular songs. Matheson, for

[TD 413]

whom see SO 75–77, is well known as the author of at least three surviving songs – to Lovat about 1717, to Seaforth in 1719 (see pp. 471–72), and to Alastair Dubh of Glengarry in 1721. As for MacLeod, Dr Malcolm Bangor-Jones has speculated (personal communication) that he may perhaps be identified with Norman MacLeod, tacksman, man of business, and chamberlain of Coigach for MacKenzie of Cromartie. This fits well with the fact that two of his sons were ministers.

In chronological order, the sources which back Matheson’s claim to authorship are: ‘Dìomoladh Chabair Féidh’ (c. 1720), first published in Turner’s collection (1813), pp. 28–37; Turner’s collection, p. 22; MacDonald’s collection (1821), p. 92; Benjamin Urquhart (1823), who says (EUL MS Mackinnon 10C, f. 381r) that the poem is Leis a Bhard Mhacmhathan uramach (‘By the honourable Matheson Poet’); Lochalsh tradition, described by Alexander Macbain in ‘The Matheson Bard’, The Celtic Monthly, vol. 15 (1907), pp. 173–75, and by Angus Matheson in ‘Gleanings from the Dornie Manuscripts’, TGSI 41 (1951–52), pp. 310–81: 329–37, and in ‘Aos Dàna II. An t-Aosdana MacMhathain’, Gairm 9 (Am Foghar 1954), pp. 33–36, and ‘Aos Dàna III. An t-Aosdana MacMhathain’, Gairm 10 (An Geamhradh 1954), pp. 124–29; and the Earl of Cromartie, A Highland History (Berkhamsted, 1979), p. 225. Those which back MacLeod’s claim are: Rev. Dr Thomas Ross, ‘Lochbroom’ (written 1835), The New Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. 14 (1845), part 2, pp. 72–90: 78; SO 361; Rev. Donald Sage, Memorabilia Domestica (Wick, 1889), p. 5; Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair, The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), p. 31; and Prof. William J. Watson, ‘Cabar Feidh’, An Gaidheal, vol. 25 (1929–30), pp. 82–85: 85.

In a series of six articles under the title ‘Moladh Chabar Féidh’, published in The West Highland Free Press between 22 September and 1 December 2000, I attempted to review the evidence in detail. In the fifth article (17 November) I distilled my conclusions into what I chose to call a ‘conspiracy’ theory and a ‘cock-up’ theory. My ‘conspiracy’ theory was that Murdoch Matheson (who was clearly capable of making comic satires, but was now involved in the clandestine administration of the Seaforth estate on behalf of the exiled chief) was responsible for everything, and regretted it. His ‘gathering of the clans’ fell foul of Mac Mhaighstir Alastair; his ‘Alness’ material fell foul of the Munros and others who, having come out on top in 1716, must not be further offended. Tormod Bàn, conveniently far away in Lochbroom, was paid to claim responsibility, his payment being land in neighbouring Assynt, which the MacKenzies (finding it hard to control) had been wadsetting back to MacLeods ever since they obtained it in 1690. Tormod Bàn appears to have moved from Lochbroom to Assynt at some point.

My less far-fetched ‘cock-up’ theory was as follows. Murdoch Matheson composes a song in praise of Seaforth which offers political advice and lists his potential allies (the ‘gathering of the clans’). It has

[TD 414]

an excellent tune and is a ‘hit’. The ‘gathering of the clans’ falls foul of the MacDonalds, and has been quietly forgotten by the time the ‘short version’ is written down. The tune is too good to waste, however, and Tormod Bàn uses it (along with quite a few of Murdoch’s words) in a hilarious song about the Alness affair which he composes to annoy his business rival William Munro of Achany. Not surprisingly, Tormod Bàn’s first three verses creep into the version heard by Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair.

Tormod Bàn must have had good reason to wish to remind Munro of the Alness affair. John Mackenzie refers (SO 361) to an incident in which the pro-Hanoverian Earl of Sutherland authorised William Munro of Achany (near Lairg) to raid Assynt. He carried off a great many cattle as well as much butter and cheese from the shielings, especially those of the poet’s friend and neighbour Alexander MacKenzie of Ardloch. However, Dr Bangor-Jones has pointed out to me that Ardloch did not move to Assynt from Coigach until the late 1720s at the earliest. One of Ardloch’s sons fought for Prince Charles as an officer in Cromartie’s regiment in the ’45, and there is indeed some evidence that the Munros played a part in reprisals against the MacKenzies of Ardloch after the ’45. This, then, is why John Mackenzie felt obliged to say (SO 361) that the Munros had ‘antecedently’ made themselves obnoxious to Tormod Bàn ‘by their adherence to the Hanoverian cause in 1745’ – thus appearing to date our poem post 1745.

However, there is no trace whatever of Prince Charles or the ’45 in our poem, and it is probably safer to see Achany’s raid following the ’45 as the continuation of a feud which had begun in the late 1720s or early 1730s. Dr Bangor-Jones points out that Aeneas MacLeod, who belonged to that branch of the MacLeods which had supported the MacKenzie takeover of Assynt in the 1670s, received a wadset (mortgage) of Ledmore and other lands in 1690 in satisfaction of an outstanding claim upon the estate. It is this wadset which was assigned to Ardloch, and his tenure can thus be seen as controversial. In my note on lines 145–60 I point to the years 1726–37 as the likely period in which Tormod Bàn’s version of the poem was composed; I would therefore suggest that William Munro first carried out a raid upon Ardloch’s shielings in this period, and that this was the raid that provoked our song.

In fact, I find the poem’s three references to Assynt (lines 92, 102, 171) a little contrived. Watson pointed out (An Gaidheal, vol. 25, p. 85) that Assynt of line 102 is the district at the mouth of Glen Glass in Ferindonald, the Munro territory, but in terms of rhetoric it is not quite as simple as that. Dr Bangor-Jones tells me that Assynt in Ferindonald had passed to the MacKenzies in the seventeenth century, forming part of the Inchcoulter estate. In the manner of classic satire, then, these references are signals to the audience that the song has a local significance in Assynt (Sutherland) which the author has chosen not to make explicit. Tormod Bàn’s ceilidh-house audience would have known

[TD 415]

very well that implicit reference was being made to Achany’s depredations. It would have brought the house down.

‘Moladh Chabair Féidh’ is very much a Ross-shire song, and the version best known in Ross-shire – Tormod Bàn’s – is the one remembered today. This version, basically John Mackenzie’s, cannot be understood without reference to the ‘Alness affair’. The most detailed account of this is in the Earl of Cromartie’s A Highland History, pp. 222–24, and I paraphrase it here.

Following the raising of the Jacobite standard at Braemar on 6 September 1715, the MacDonalds of Skye under Sir Donald MacDonald joined Seaforth at Brahan with 800 men. The MacKenzie rally of between 3,000 and 4,000 men, including 200 from Lewis, took place at Inchrory (Milnain), from where a detachment was sent under Sir John MacKenzie of Coul and George MacKenzie of Gruinard (for whom see poem 5) to take over the Castle of Inverness in the name of the Chevalier.

Meanwhile Sir Robert Munro, leader of the Hanoverian interest in Ross-shire, was politely requested to hand over his arms. He replied by garrisoning his own castle of Foulis and sending his second son, Captain George Munro of Culcairn, to join the Earl of Sutherland at his strongly entrenched camp of Alness, which had been further strengthened by artillery borrowed from a warship in Cromarty Roads. Sutherland had been appointed supreme commander in the north for the Hanoverian regime. The forces at his disposal in the Alness camp consisted of 300 of his own men. The remainder were blocking the passes north of the Oykel, as an invasion of Sutherland by 2,000 fighting men from Ross was expected. Other forces brought the total in the camp at Alness to 1,200 – MacKays under Lord Reay and Scourie, Munros under Lemlair and Newmore, and some Rosses under Braelangwell.

The Hanoverians held a council of war. It was attended in addition by Ross of Pitcalnie, Ross of Easter Fearn and Ross of Tolly, who agreed that their supporters from the six eastern parishes of Ross-shire should rendezvous at Muldearg and march on Inverness, while those from Strathoykel and Strathcarron were to concentrate at Braelangwell and Kindeace. The total strength of the Ross-shire supporters of the House of Hanover amounted to only 700 men.

On 8 October Seaforth moved – not southwards to join the Earl of Mar’s Jacobite army at Perth as was intended, but eastwards to deal with the enemy strongpoint at Alness, which otherwise would have been a standing menace in his rear. The MacKenzies and their allies ascended the heights of Fodderty and Brae, descended into Strath Skiach, and crossed the Burn, spending the night of 9 October in the township of Clare, which at that time was part of Foulis. Next day they traversed Swordale, crossed the Allt Grànd’ and ascended Glenglass, going through the defile between Cnoc a’ Ghille Bhrònaich and Caishlan down to the township of Boath. Here, by fording the Alness

[TD 416]

River and marching five miles via Strathrusdale and Ardross, Seaforth was in a position to attack the enemy from an unexpected quarter and also to cut off Sutherland’s retreat to Bonar.

On 13 October Sutherland evacuated his fortified camp, beating a hasty retreat while the road remained open. He had decided that to face an attack from flank and rear with a not over-zealous force would be very unwise. Foulis capitulated on terms, handing over 200 stands of arms and a substantial levy for the Jacobite war-chest, having already lost some cattle. Sir William Gordon of Invergordon also suffered some depredations. Meanwhile the burgh of Tain was occupied by a mixed force of 400 or 500 MacKenzies, Chisholms and MacDonalds under Lord Duffus, who proclaimed James VIII at the mercat cross.

Mar now summoned Seaforth to join him at Perth as quickly as possible. Some delays followed, for which Seaforth has been blamed (cf. poem 20, note on lines 25–32) although, as the Earl of Cromartie points out on his behalf, a large Hanoverian force remained intact north of the Oykel. Vital time had indeed been lost to the Jacobite cause, however. What was needed to bring over the waverers was a swift and decisive victory, but when the battle came it was late and humiliating. At Sheriffmuir on 13 November, Argyll held off a much larger Jacobite army under Mar, including Seaforth’s forces. James VIII, the ‘Old Pretender’, did not arrive from France until 22 December (at Peterhead). He was crowned at Scone, but by 4 February 1716 he was safely back aboard ship at Montrose and heading home for France. The ’15 was over. Its natural course had been seriously disrupted by the Alness affair; it was a mistake avoided by the better-led Jacobites of 1745, by which time, however, the Seaforth family was already well on its way to ruin.

I take the poem mainly from SO 359–61, adding lines 81–96 from Gairm 10, p. 127. Benjamin Urquhart’s version in EUL MS Mackinnon 10C, ff. 381r–385v (pp. 68–75), lacks lines 33–40 and 81–88 but provides some excellent alternative readings. Turner’s slightly muddled 184-line version of 1813 (pp. 22–28 of his collection) was the first to be published. The version given by Ronald MacDonald, Ardnish, Arisaig, in his Orain, maille ri Co-Chruinneachadh Dain, Orain, &c. (Inverness, 1821), pp. 92–100, also lacks lines 81–96 and was clearly another important source for John Mackenzie. Editions published after 1841 were taken from SO; in The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), pp. 31–37, the Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair attempted a little further editing. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 21.

6 “Gu’m meal ’s gu’n caith thu e! may you enjoy and wear it! – said to a person who wears any new garment for the first time, and considered unlucky if first said to the wearer by a female; na ’n na mheal thu e! may you never enjoy it! – never live to wear

[TD 417]

it” (Dwelly, s.v. meal). The basic expression remains common nowadays. Meal is caith do bhrògan ùra! “Enjoy and wear your new shoes!”

14 Urquhart has cac for neart – ‘Their shit deserted them’!

19–24 It is a little surprising that the poet should choose to mention Roses (Ròsaich) rather than Rosses (Rosaich), but Ròsaich is required for aicill rhyme with ghòrach. There again, no doubt some Roses of Kilravock were in the camp at Alness, along with Munros, Sutherlands, MacKays, Rosses, and some Frasers, Grants, and Forbeses of Culloden. See note on line 45. The Roses’ chief claim to fame in the ’15 was the dramatic capture of Inverness from the MacKenzies of Coul and Gruinard on 13 November, for which see Cosmo Innes (ed.), A Genealogical Deduction of the Family of Rose of Kilravock (Spalding Club, Edinburgh, 1848), p. 381. See also poem 10, note on line 33.

38 Maclean Sinclair has air am malaichean (‘on their brows’), but I suspect this is his attempt to repair a rhyme which was not in fact broken. In eighteenth-century terms bhealaichean : cheannéideadh : h-uile fear : cladaichean is acceptable.

41 This may refer to attempts to flee across the Cromarty Firth, or the Kyle of Sutherland at Bonar.

44 Urquhart on the one hand, and Turner and Ronald MacDonald on the other, are more rhythmic. They give nach freagradh iad and nach freagaireadh respectively, both in effect meaning ‘When their guns would not respond’. Maclean Sinclair makes it nach freagradh dhaibh (‘would not respond to them’). The comic effect of srad should not be overlooked, however.

45 Urquhart gives ’S a liuthad saighdear ’n chinneadh Rosach (‘And so many soldiers of the Ross clan’); Turner and MacDonald give ’S a liuthad toirtear ’n chinne Rosach (‘And so many grandees of the Ross clan’). This solves the problem that the Rosses are otherwise unmentioned in the poem.

49 Turner has Cha cheil mi fhéin mo dhùrachd (‘I will not hide my wishes’), and Ronald MacDonald has (in his own spelling) Cha ’n eil mi fhein am dhùrachd, which I do not understand.

55–56 The Forfeited Estates commissioners. For their unsuccessful attempts to take possession of the Seaforth estate or its rental see Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Clan Mackenzie (Inverness, 1879), pp. 224, 230–40, and note on lines 145–60 below. It is possible that here, as at line 159 of poem 10, Dùbhghaill (literally ‘Black Lowlanders’) is to be understood as ‘Englishmen’. According to Michael Lynch, Scotland: A New History (1992 edn, London), p. 331, the Commission was a largely English body.

62 While the Jacobite occupation of the Munro estate appears to have been bloodless, there was clearly much looting and also some destruction of property. In the above-mentioned article

[TD 418]

in An Gaidheal (p. 84), Watson cites a reference in the records of the Presbytery of Dingwall to ‘two parochial Libraries which were destroyed in the Manse of Alness’ and to ‘damages which Mr Daniel McGilligan sustained at that time’. He also refers to am Baile Nodha, which he says was frequently styled am Baile Ùr.

Am Baile Nodha must have been a very insignificant place in 1715; in 1791 the minister of Kiltearn, describing his parish for the Old Statistical Account, makes no mention of it, though he mentions the ‘small village of Drummond, situated in a level field contiguous to the river Skiach. This village is yet in its infancy’. Drummond is a little to the west of Evanton; the Skiach flows between the two places. The New Statistical Account of 1841 states that Evanton had no existence as a village thirty years before the time of writing, i.e., in 1810. In English form Am Baile Nodha appears as Newton, the name of a farm on the left side of the Allt Grannda, near Novar Station.

70 Urquhart has nach dùraicheadh fallan thu ‘who didn’t wish you well’, which makes better sense, perhaps.

71–72 Urquhart has Ga chrochadh no ga sgiùrsadh / Gu dùthaich nach b’ aithne dhaibh ‘Being hanged or being scourged / To a land they didn’t know’ – another better reading. In the heritable jurisdictions of the time, scourging and banishment was a popular alternative to hanging. For the crime of consorting with a known outlaw, for example, one Margaret Bayn was condemned c. 1700 by the Regality Court of Grant ‘to be brought to the Regality Cross at Grantown to-morrow, 14th inst., and bound thereto, and her bodie maid bear from the belt upward, and scourged by the hangman with thratie strypes, and ane of her ears cutt off, and she to be then banished out of Strathspey for ever’, see W. Forsyth, In the Shadow of Cairngorm (Inverness, 1900), p. 146.

75 Turner and MacDonald have chorca druimfhionn (‘black-backed knives’).

77 Seaforth and Lovat (Mac Shimidh, the chief of the Frasers) were arch rivals.

83–84 This is in the stanza restored by Angus Matheson (Gairm 10, p. 127) from MacLagan and Turner, and may be corrupt. However, the tone matches the intelligent, probing one of the political satire which I believe to be part of Matheson’s original ‘Moladh Chabair Féidh’ (Gairm 10, pp. 128–29). It shows a clear-headed view of how, through lack of professionalism, defeat in the ’15 was snatched from the jaws of victory.

92 Primarily Assynt (Ferindonald), secondarily Assynt (Sutherland). Thus also line 102. Urquhart gives Nall bho Asainn, ‘Over from Assynt’.

104 The reference is to rents paid in kind in the form of hens. This

was a widespread practice at the time, see Henry Grey Graham, The Social Life of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century (2nd edn, London, 1906), pp. 162–63. There was little dignity in it. In ‘Cumha Coire a’ Cheathaich’ (‘The Lament for Misty Corrie’), Duncan Ban Macintyre, for whom see poems 41 and 49, satirises a man called MacEwen who was a maor chearc or ‘hen bailiff’, his job being to go around the townships raising the càin chearc or ‘hen tax’.

“It had always been his custom / To collect the fattened chickens — / It’s often they were squawking / At the torture of your hands; / They being tied in brindled bundles / Round your neck and in your oxters, / There’d be fluttering and squirming / Round your teeth as a result.” See Angus MacLeod, The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952, repr. 1978), p. 176, and also notes on poem 51.

107–12 At lines 109–10 Turner and MacDonald have Chaoidh chan fhaicear aca mhartfheòil / Mur bi cearc am poit aca (‘Never are they seen with beef / Unless they’ve chicken in a pot’) and at line 112 they have Nuair thréigeas gach cosnadh iad (‘When all employment fails them’). At lines 107–12 Urquhart gives:

(“They have no pot on the fire there / Unless there’s a drop of porridge there [innt ‘in it’ scored out]; / They never have a roast on spit / Without a chicken to make gruel, / They’re gathered in by begging / When their cost runs out on them.”) Following this, Urquhart gives the following ironic half-stanza about the Laird of Foulis’s womenfolk:

(“Ritzy and randy was the state of your baggages, / Far did they stray from your bonking: / You got a slaughtering by the seashore / That sped you speedily to glory; / Before she got a husband he got a woman / And he’ll not make the old girl pregnant — / She was all of fifty years old / Before our Beelzebub took her.”) For Crom an Donais (literally ‘Hunchback of the Devil’) see poem 33, note on line 40. Turner (p. 25) has the same, with no major differences. For collainn see poem 36, note on line 2.

132 “And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray.” Lev. 11: 13.

139 I have preferred Turner’s and Urquhart’s reading here. MacDonald and SO have Nì guidhe bhuan do bhuntainn bhuaith’ (‘Prays all the time you’ll be taken away’), which sounds very weak.

145–60 I agree with Maclean Sinclair (The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765, p. 37) that the individual satirised in this stanza is likely to be the redoubtable Lt.-Col. Donald Murchison, Seaforth’s factor, who fought at Sheriffmuir in 1715, retook Brahan from the Munros in 1716, defended Kintail and Lochalsh against military incursions at Àth nam Muileach in 1721 and Attadale in 1722, collected Seaforth’s rents, and transmitted them regularly to him in France and Spain until his return in 1726. Murchison received little thanks from Seaforth for his trouble, and had died broken-hearted by 1737. If this stanza is indeed about him, it suggests that Tormod Bàn’s version of the poem may have been composed as late as 1726–37, and it is possible that it reflects a view of him which was in line with Seaforth’s: that he had been bought by the Munros, that he enriched himself at the expense of the estate, and that his ultimate poverty was his own fault. Robert Chambers (followed by Alexander Mackenzie) stresses that ‘as every generous person can now well understand, he was a high-minded gentleman’, but it is clear that his contemporaries were in two minds about his character. To the Lowland public, he was a notorious cateran to be linked with Colla nam Bó (for whom see BSC 134) and Rob Roy MacGregor (for whom see poem 27).

[TD 421]

Keppoch, Rob Roy, and Daniel Murchison,
Cadets or servants to some chief of clan,
From theft and robberies scarce did ever cease,
Yet ’scaped the halter each, and died in peace.

The key to the attitude to Murchison expressed in this stanza (if it is indeed about him) may lie in his chivalrous behaviour following the battle at Àth nam Muileach, 2 October 1721. According to Chambers, it was alleged afterwards that he was much blamed by his own people for allowing the defeated enemy – and particularly their leaders, William Ross of Easter Fearn and his brother Bailie Robert Ross of Tain, whom the Forfeited Estates Commissioners had appointed as factors to the Seaforth estate – to escape with their lives and baggage. Indeed, according to a traditional account (communicated to Chambers by F. Macdonald, Druidag Lodge, Lochalsh), Murchison lent “Captain Monro of Fearn” a few of his men to help him convey his mortally wounded son Walter free of molestation as far as Knockfin on the heights of Strathglass. This act, along with the mistaken assumption that the factors were Munros (the only Munro involved appears in fact to have been a sergeant in the Royal Regiment of North British Fusiliers), may explain the reference to an ‘errand’ at line 157. The Rosses reached home safely, but not before Walter Ross had died in his litter. As they passed through Beauly a MacLennan woman made a satire containing this vicious sarcasm:

<gai>
Gun deach Fear Feàrn a mhaslachadh
’S gun deach a mhac a mharbhadh,
’S gun tug sibh màl a’ Mharcais leibh
Air chupall each ’s air carbad.
<eng>

(“Easter Fearn’s been humbled / And his son’s been killed, / And you’ve brought the Marquis’s rent / On a bier between two horses.”) As if this were not bad enough, a crosanachd, of all things, was made on the event – apparently by Murdoch Matheson himself – called ‘Marbhrann Bhaltair’ (‘Walter’s Elegy’), see p. 408 above. See also: Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 3 (3rd edn, Edinburgh, 1874), pp. 458–64, 468–71; Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Clan Mackenzie (Inverness, 1879), p. 240; William Mackay, ‘Donald Murchison and the Factors on the Forfeited Estates’, TGSI 19 (1893–94), pp. 1–12: 11–12; William Mackay, Urquhart and Glenmoriston (2nd edn, Inverness, 1914), pp. 236–37; Angus Matheson, ‘Gleanings from the Dornie Manuscripts’, TGSI 41 (1951–52), pp. 310–81: 320–23; Gairm 9, p. 35.

145 There is a play of words here on cabar. The term cabar feàrna is

[TD 422]

given in Dwelly’s dictionary: ‘a rung or rafter of alder’. It implies a weak rung in a ladder or a weak rafter in a house, hence an Achilles heel. Given the rest of the stanza, however, which appears to describe a homeless person, we may also take it literally. This fits with what we know of the last years of Donald Murchison. “He was offered only a small farm called Bundalloch, which pays at this day to Mr Matheson, the proprietor, no more than £60 a year; or another place opposite to Inverinate House, of about the same value. It is no wonder he refused these paltry offers. He shortly afterwards left this country [Kintail], and died in the prime of life near Conon” (F. Macdonald’s communication in Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 3, p. 471, also cited in History of the Clan Mackenzie, pp. 240–41). Turner and Urquhart have cabar feara(i)nn Dòmhnaill, which may be regarded as another pun – ‘the pole of Donald’s land’ or ‘Ferindonald’s pole’, ‘Ferindonald’s antlers’. Ferindonald is the Munro country.

150 I do not know who George can be. One candidate is George MacKenzie of Gruinard, author of poem 5. Turner, MacDonald and Urquhart all have an garaidh(e)ach, presumably ‘from Glengarry’, referring no doubt to a MacKenzie fostered in Glengarry. Maclean Sinclair emends an caraideach to as caraid dha (‘who’s related to him’), and suggests that he is George MacKenzie of Kildun, who assisted Murchison at Àth nam Muileach in 1721. Kildun, who lived at Aignish near Stornoway, was a cousin of Seaforth’s, and had brought a levy of Lewismen to the encounter, see Chambers’s Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 3, p. 462, and notes on poem 2. His widow entertained Prince Charles at Aignish in 1746 (SO 392).

151 Kenneth MacKenzie of Dundonnell. Urquhart and Maclean Sinclair have Coinneach Acha Dòmhnaill, ‘Kenneth of Acha Dòmhnaill’, which must I think be Dundonnell; the same goes for Turner’s and MacDonald’s Coinneach Acha-da-donuill, literally ‘Kenneth of the Field-of-Two-Donalds’.

166 This appears to be the line replied to by Mac Mhaighstir Alastair in the following terms (A. and A. Macdonald, The Poems of Alexander MacDonald (Inverness, 1924), p. 300):

<gai>
Ach ar leam fhéin gur gòrach

(“But in my view it’s stupid /That Mac Cailein was warned off by you, / When it’s beyond all dispute / That he’s a hero abroad.”) Mac Cailein is the Duke of Argyll.

171 Primarily Assynt (Sutherland), secondarily Assynt (Ferindonald).

[TD 423]

172 This is Scalpay (Skye), for which see poem 4, line 5, not Scalpay (Harris).

181 Maclean Sinclair gives Na Garranaich ’s Clann Fhionghain here, presumably because he believes, rightly no doubt, that Mac Mhic Alastair (MacDonald of Glengarry) is meant rather than MacAllister of Loup, and because Glengarry had tenants in Lochcarron until 1607.


23. Beannachadh Bàird

The name of the blind piper John MacKay (Am Pìobaire Dall, 1656–1754) and his music are well known to pipers to this day. He was born at Talladale in Gairloch, only son of Roderick MacKay (c. 1592 – c. 1689), a native of Sutherland who had become family piper to the MacKenzies of Gairloch. He was not born blind, but lost his sight through smallpox when about seven years old. He studied under the MacCrimmons in Skye, and it is of him that it was said, Chaidh am foghlam os cionn MhicCruimein (‘The learning has surpassed MacCrimmon’), see Donald E. Meek (ed.), The Campbell Collection of Gaelic Proverbs (Inverness, 1978), p. 55.

In due course, by about 1689, Iain Dall succeeded his father, and served the Gairloch MacKenzies for over half a century as both piper and poet. He was a frequent visitor to both Sutherland and Skye. Around the 1690s he was a member of the so-called Talisker circle, for which see notes on poem 4. According to John Mackenzie, whose account of him in SO 94–95 consists, as always, of a series of illuminating anecdotes, he composed 24 pieces of pìobaireachd and numberless strathspeys, reels and jigs. Many of his tunes are listed by John Maclean in ‘Am Pìobaire Dall’, TGSI 41 (1951–52), pp. 283–306: 303–04. They include ‘Crosanachd an Doill’, which is known in English as ‘The Blind Piper’s Obstinacy’, but cf. notes on poem 21. Only three of his poems appear to be extant, the most important being ‘Cumha Choire an Easa’ (‘Corrienessan’s Lament’), which was made in or after 1696, see Colm Ó Baoill and Meg Bateman, Gàir nan Clàrsach: The Harps’ Cry (Edinburgh, 1994), pp. 206–13. Says Maclean (p. 302): “John was primarily a piper and composer of music; he is never the bàrd dall, but always the pìobaire dall.”

Like his father, Iain Dall married late in life. He had two children, his son Angus who succeeded him, and a daughter, who was to become the mother of a still greater poet, William Ross (see poems 55 and 57). Echoes of his work appear in some of Ross’s poems. There is, of course, much about him in the very considerable literature on piping, see for example ‘Notices of Pipers’, Piping Times, March 1972, p. 13. See also J. H. Dixon, Gairloch (Edinburgh, 1886, repr. Gairloch, 1974), pp. 177–79.

Our poem was composed upon the marriage in 1730 of Sir Alex-

[TD 424]

ander MacKenzie (1700–66), 9th laird of Gairloch, to his cousin Janet. Janet was a daughter of Sir Roderick MacKenzie, 5th of Scatwell, by his wife (also Janet), daughter of Ludovic Grant of Grant. Sir Alexander’s wife bore him nine children, but they separated in 1758 on grounds of ‘incompatibility of temper’, after which she went to live alone at Kinkell Castle. Sir Alexander also had three natural children. In 1738 he pulled down the old family residence of Stankhouse or Taigh Dìge, and built a new one in a much better situation. He vastly improved his property and kept out of the ’45, with which he had no sympathy; he was ‘in all respects a careful and good man of business’, see Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Clan Mackenzie (Inverness, 1879), pp. 337–42.

A twelve-stanza version of our poem was published in the Stewart collection of 1804, pp. 225–27. In his Òrain Ghàëlach, le Uilleam Ros (2nd edn, Glasgow, 1834), pp. 181–84, John Mackenzie included eleven stanzas of it in a supplement consisting of MacKay’s three extant poems. He reprinted these eleven stanzas in SO 96. This was the version presented by Watson in BGh 123–25 (he says that the metre is syllabic, a statement which we must treat with caution). In ‘The Blind Piper’s Salute’, TGSI 3/4 (1873–75), pp. 191–95, the historian Alexander Mackenzie published a 15-stanza version taken from a document which, he says, was written before 1745 and believed by Sir Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch to be the presentation copy given by the poet to Sir Alexander on the occasion of the wedding. A rather different version of the full text was published by A. Maclean Sinclair, The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), pp. 39–42. The four stanzas not in SO or BGh are our lines 17–24 and 53–60. My text takes some account of all these sources. For a complete source-list see Colm Ó Baoill and Donald MacAulay, Scottish Gaelic Vernacular Verse to 1730: A Checklist (Aberdeen, 1988), p. 5.

7–8 Janet’s two grandfathers were Sir Kenneth MacKenzie of Scatwell and Ludovic, 17th Baron of Grant. For the court of the Regality of Grant see poem 22, note on lines 71–72, poem 53, note on line 94, and poem 56, note on lines 53–56.

11 An Taoitear Sàileach, usually An Taoitear Tàileach, Sir Roderick MacKenzie of Coigach (Ruairidh Mór, d. 1626), was son of Colin Cam MacKenzie of Kintail and brother of Kenneth, 1st Lord MacKenzie of Kintail. He was tutor (guardian) of Lord Kenneth’s son Colin (later 1st Earl of Seaforth) during his minority, and had a great reputation for severity. He founded the family of Cromartie, and his second son was the first MacKenzie of Scatwell.

12 This may have been suggested by the legend which tells how Kenneth, ancestor of the MacKenzies, rescued King Alexander II from the attack of a furious stag, the origin of the Cabar Féidh crest. Cuidich an Rìgh (‘Help the King’) became the motto of the Seaforth Highlanders.

[TD 425]

17–20 Maclean Sinclair has:

<gai>
Spé anns am faighteadh gu pailt
Am bradan bu sgairteil leum
’S e dìreadh bho chuan nan tonn
’S ag iarraidh nam poll glan réidh.
<eng>

(“Spey where plentifully found /Would be salmon of strenuous leap / Climbing from ocean of waves / And seeking the pure smooth pools.”)

21 I have followed Maclean Sinclair here, as Alexander Mackenzie’s version is hypermetric: Gheibhte siud aig Clann Ailpein nam fiadh dearg … (‘The following could be had from Clan Alpin of red deer …’) Like the MacGregors and MacKinnons, the Grants believed themselves to be descended from the father of Kenneth mac Alpin, see poem 8, note on lines 97–98.

29 This may reflect the bridal fashion of the day, although we should remind ourselves at this point that the poet was blind.

36 Watson points out (BGh 294) that we may compare this to do dhearc mar néimh óir ar oighridh (‘your eye like the sheen of gold upon ice’) in a sixteenth-century poem to Angus MacDonald of Islay.

38 SO, Maclean Sinclair and BGh give ’S bu bhuachaille i air do-bheus. If the stress were on do, this would mean ‘And she was a cowherd to bad behaviour’; unfortunately it is on bheus (for rhyme with fheum). Thus it appears to refer to the husband’s morals – ‘And she was a cowherd to your behaviour’! This would be a little mischievous, and may be a retrospective view of Sir Alexander’s character, rather than what the poet actually sang at the wedding, so I have preferred Alexander Mackenzie’s reading. Note that in terms of the eighteenth-century Highlands, ‘cowherd’ is a word of much higher status than ‘shepherd’, and in no way pejorative.

52 Maclean Sinclair gives Dh’ainneoin ceist le’m fiachteadh ris, which I do not understand.

57 Maclean Sinclair gives Ged nach robh mis’ air a’ bhanais (‘Though I was not at the wedding’)!


24. from Moladh Mòraig

Alexander MacDonald (Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, c. 1698 – c. 1770) is the greatest Gaelic poet of the eighteenth century, and arguably of all time. His greatness lies in his originality. It was he above all who pulled Gaelic verse dramatically forward from the panegyric code, consciously rejecting the poets’ traditional function of praising great men – at least until the Highland Jacobites enrolled him as their principal propagandist.

[TD 426]

It is quite easy to list his innovations. He was the first Gaelic poet to publish his own work (in 1751), to adapt to verse the ground and variations of pìobaireachd (as in ‘Moladh Mòraig’), to put praise of kindred in the beak of a smeòrach or thrush (see poem 37, note on lines 109–12), to make songs about the seasons, and to create an epic (see poem 39). He also compiled a substantial Gaelic vocabulary, developed an orthographic system appropriate to the vernacular, began work on the first anthology of Gaelic verse, learned to use the old Gaelic hand, collected at least one traditional tale, and wrote English prose that was racy, elegant or witty as required. He had a vision of an inclusive, religiously tolerant, bilingual Scotland which was over two hundred years ahead of its time. Even so, none of this quite prepares us for the dynamic experimentation which is constantly to be found, for example, in the last area of his work to be studied in depth, his scatological satires, where he might compare a woman’s body to a rotten tree, or blend traditional images of sex and death in order to see how explosive the mixture might be.

A clergyman’s son from Dalilea in Moidart, Mac Mhaighstir Alastair was born an Episcopalian, conformed to Presbyterianism, and ultimately converted to Catholicism. He attended Glasgow University in the heady days of political and literary debate following the Union of 1707, and may have fought at Sheriffmuir. Trained to the law, he spent the years around 1720 in the service of Lady Penelope MacDonald (widow of Ailean Dearg of Clanranald, for whom see poems 11, 12 and 13), travelling between Uist, Moidart, Edinburgh and (probably) London in an effort to reverse the forfeiture of his estate. See Dòmhnull Uilleam Stiùbhart, ‘Trì Pìosan Bàrdachd á Dùthaich Chlann Raghnaill’, in Iris a’ Chomainn Cheiltich / The Highland Society Journal (Edinburgh, 1995), pp. 26–30: 28.

In 1727 the poet settled down in Ardnamurchan as a schoolmaster for the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, and shortly afterwards he married Jane MacDonald of the Clann Reubhair in Glen Etive, for whom see poem 10, note on line 39. Fhuair mi fhìn ’nad phàist’ thu, he declares in his marriage song, ‘I got you as a schoolgirl’. They had five children (Ronald and four daughters). In ‘Moladh Mòraig’, however, he lists and describes four previous girlfriends, complains of the ‘pettinesses’ or ‘trifles’ (line 8), ‘tight bonds’ (lines 65–66) and ‘detestable spancel’ (line 119) of wedlock, and wishes he were ‘free / Of these shackles’ (lines 97–98). “It will be very damaging,” he adds, “if this is not hidden from Jane.” Too true. The poem describes the pleasures of making love to ‘Morag’, who is eventually revealed (in a brief return to consciousness) as Sìne an òr-fhuilt chuachaich (‘Jane of the curly golden hair’). He makes love to Jane, then tells us, ’S gun shaoil mi gum b’i Mòrag i (‘And I thought she was Morag’). Morag may symbolise Jacobitism, as did the more demure spéirbhean (‘sky woman’) of the popular aisling or vision poetry of contemporary Ireland. Indeed, according to one commentator –

[TD 427]

Benjamin Urquhart, in EUL MS Mackinnon 10C, f. 413r – even Rob Donn’s ‘Iseabal NicAoidh aig a’ Chrodh Laoigh’ (‘Isabel MacKay with the Calving Cows’) represented Prince Charles when in hiding after Culloden ‘as his own name durst not be mentioned’. Alastair may have claimed something of the sort to his wife, but Jane clearly did not believe a word of it, and his next act suggests that, whatever the arguments, he was the loser. All that he had said of Morag he now reversed in the equally brilliant ‘Mìomholadh Mòraig’ (‘Dispraise of Morag’), for which see p. xxiii above.

Clearly Alastair lived mainly to perform, and his huge strengths were balanced by huge flaws. But Jane had had poets in her family too, and she can probably be seen as the great and largely tolerant wife of a great and largely intolerant man. After these two poems the name and figure of Morag do not disappear, but persist in Alastair’s work as an ever-changing allegory. Now she is Jane, now she is Jacobitism, now she is Prince Charles, but always when described she is unambiguously female – rather as if he were stubbornly trying to prove to his wife, to his critics and admirers, or even to himself, that the voluptuous Morag of the original poem was an allegory all along. See my Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: The Ardnamurchan Years (Coll, 1986), pp. 8, 15, 18–19; for more on Alastair’s life see also notes on poems 30, 36 and 39.

I take my text from the only scholarly edition of the poem, Derick S. Thomson, Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: Selected Poems (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1996), pp. 56–74. Thomson provides a complete source-list at p. 56. In making my translation I have had the advantage of being able to consult a draft translation in the papers of Angus MacLeod (the editor of The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre), who was preparing an edition of Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s work when he died in 1960. These papers were kindly gifted to the University of Edinburgh’s Department of Celtic by my then colleague Dr (now Professor) Donald Meek.


25. Laoidh MhicEalair

David MacKellar, known as Dàibhidh nan Laoidh (‘David of the Hymns’), who was said by Duncan Kennedy (Laoidheadair, p. 129) to have been a native either of Glassary or of Strachur, lived in Glendaruel, Argyll, during the first half of the century. His dates of birth and death are unknown. Like Dugald Buchanan (poem 45), he made secular songs in his youth. Mackenzie says (SO 181), “He was blind, and the people in that country still preserve some traditionary accounts of him and of the manner in which his hymn was composed, the most striking of which is that after having composed it his sight was restored.” He adds that ‘Laoidh MhicEalair’ was so popular in the Highlands that ‘many persons got it by heart that had never seen the Printed copy’. The Rev. Dr John MacInnes, in The Evangelical Movement in the Highlands of Scotland (Aberdeen, 1951), p. 276, explains why.

[TD 428]

With a verbal economy uncommon in Gaelic poetry, and with an unerring sense of proportion, he describes the Creation, the Fall, the Incarnation, the Passion, the Resurrection and Ascension of our Lord, concluding with the Last Judgement and the condition of the redeemed and the lost. Didactically, and also devotionally, it is the perfect ‘dan spioradail’ [spiritual poem].


It is said to have been published by John Orr, a native of Bute, in Glasgow in 1752. No copies of this first edition survive. John Reid, in Bibliotheca Scoto-Celtica (Glasgow, 1832), pp. lxvii and 109, says that “McKellar’s Hymns” [sic] was printed in duodecimo at Glasgow about 1750, but marks it as ‘having been heard of, not seen’. If the date 1752 is correct and MacKellar was then still alive, it makes him (following hard on the heels of Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, see notes on poem 24) only the second Gaelic poet to have had his work published in his lifetime.

I take the poem basically from Duncan Kennedy’s collection of 1786, pp. 125–31; the Gillies collection of the same year gives (pp. 14–18) a slightly shorter version of 30 stanzas containing many good variant readings. I have also made use of a version in Deasbaireachd eadar am Papa agus an t-Athleasacha le Donnacha Loudinn maille ri Laoidh Mholaidh do Chruith-fhear ’n t-Shaoghail, le Daibhidh Macaileir (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1833), pp. 25–29. Kennedy republished the poem in An Laoidheadair Gaelic (Glasgow, 1834), pp. 123–29, and this appears to be the version followed by Mackenzie in SO 181–83. A work entitled Laoidh le Daibhadh Mac Ealair; agus dà dhàn eile, le Iain Carsuel, Easbuig Innse Gall was published in Glasgow in 1835. Finally, in EUL Carmichael-Watson MS 61, pp. 29–31, is a version in 67 lines headed ‘Laoidh an Doill, no Laoidh Mhic Ealair, na ghabh Domhnull Mac Leoid ’s an Oban dhith’ (‘The Blind Man’s Hymn, or MacKellar’s Hymn, as much of it as was performed by Donald MacLeod in Oban’).

1 In Deasbaireachd the first line is Molamaid Tighearna na glòir (‘Let us praise the Lord of glory’).

16 Màrt (the month of March) is used in the plural to denote the three most opportune times for the spring sowing, see my article ‘Month of Multicoloured Weather’ (WHFP, 26 February 1988).

18 An t-Àbharsair, ‘the Adversary’, is one of many by-names for the Devil.

43 The word airc ‘distress’ normally has a short vowel. Here it is long, as in àirc (‘an ark’), seemingly rhyming with gràs. None of our sources resolve the issue.

51–52 Only one source provides even a partial resolution of this unsatisfactory couplet – Deasbaireachd, which offers: Crùn geur na péin’ a bha m’a cheann / Fhuair mac Dé le nàimh d’a lot (‘The sharp crown of pain that was round His head / Is what God’s Son got from enemies wounding him’).

[TD 429]

55–56 I take this reading from Kennedy’s collection. Other sources have Domblas agus fìon geur / ’N deoch a thug iad dha ri h-òl (‘Gall and vinegar were the drink / That they offered Him for His thirst’), which lacks aicill rhyme.

94 Deasbaireachd gives: ’S tearmann do nas ionmhainn leat (‘And sanctuary to those who are dear toYou’), which provides better aicill rhyme with neach.

99–100 This is Gillies’s reading. Kennedy and Deasbaireachd have not Flath-Innis (‘Princely Meadow’) but flaitheanas (‘principality’).

107–08 This couplet lacks aicill rhyme.

123 In Celtic tradition Hell was a cold place. Mackenzie (SO 182) cites two verses in support of this, of which only the first (‘from an old poem’) actually specifies cold.

<gai>
S mairg a roghnaicheas Ifrinn fhuar
’S gur i uamh nan droigheann geur;
Is beag orm Ifrinn fhuar fhliuch —
Àite biothbhuan as searbh deoch.
<eng>

(“I’m sorry for those who choose cold Hell / As it’s a cave full of piercing thorns; / Loathsome to me is cold wet Hell — / An eternal place of bitter drink.”) The second is, he says, from ‘Dàn an Fhir Chlaoin’ (‘The Perverse Man’s Poem’):

<gai>
Ì sin allaidh na freòine
Le d’ thiugh-cheò is le t’ uabh-bhéistean,
A thìr nam pian gun bhiadh gun bhàidh,

<eng>

(“O wild isle yonder full of fury /With your thick mist and your dreadful beasts, / O land of pains without food or love, / Going to you I would find repellent.”)

131 For this line Gillies and Deasbaireachd give Thoir fuasgladh saor dhomh anns gach cùis (‘Give a free release to me in all things’). Kennedy’s collection has ’S thoir disearsa dhomh ’s gach cùis (‘And give a discharge to me in all things’), using the English legal term ‘discharge’ in Gaelic spelling.


26. Is Trom Leam an Àirigh

Rob Donn (1714–78) was born at Allt na Caillich, Strathmore, in the Reay Country in the county of Sutherland. His father, Dòmhnall Donn, was a small tenant. There is some doubt as to whether his surname was MacKay, Calder or even Donn itself; the matter is academic, however, because in terms of social organisation and allegiance everyone in the Reay Country was a MacKay. Rob Donn had no experience of education outside the ceilidh-house. He was employed by

[TD 430]

the local tacksman, John MacKay of Musal (Iain mac Eachainn), from the age of 6, first in the usual way as herd-boy, then as cattleman, finally as drover.

Rob Donn’s first love was Ann Morrison, the subject of our poem, but about 1740 he married Janet, daughter of Thomas MacKay, a small tenant in Islandreir, and they went to live at Bad na h-Achlais at the south end of Loch Hope. Rob Donn became the father of thirteen children while enjoying a roving life of droving and hunting, participating to the full in the life of the community, and gaining a towering reputation as a poet. In Morrison’s words (Songs and Poems, p. xlix), “By his satires he ruled the whole country round.”

It is hard to think of any other Gaelic poet in our period who has achieved the same degree of respect. Partly this has to do with the relatively settled nature of the Reay community throughout his lifetime: Rob Donn represents a golden age which was brought abruptly to a close by the brutal Sutherland clearances of the early nineteenth century. His work is a powerful blend of the rhetorical strengths and moral values of traditional Gaelic verse and of the newer down-to-earth social realism of presbyterianism, with perhaps just a touch of Alexander Pope thrown in – mediated to him orally by his friend the Rev. Murdoch MacDonald of Durness. Much of it is not great poetry but important poetry, and requires the kind of anecdotal treatment which is so characteristic of the ceilidh-house. ‘The Factor’s New Suit’ (Morrison’s edition, p. 445, taken from Mackintosh MacKay’s, p. 260) provides a good example. Lord Reay’s factor, MacKay of Bighouse, who had the reputation of being harsh to the tenantry, had a new suit made, but deferred trying it on until Rob Donn could be present to bestow a poet’s blessing. When the moment arrived Rob said:

<gai>
S math a tha i air do chùlaibh
’S tha i nas ro-ùrraichd air t’ uchd;
Bu chaomh leam i bhith leathann trom
Mur dèanadh i call no lochd —
Ach chan eil putan innt’ no toll
Nach do chost bonn do dhuine bochd.
<eng>

(“It is excellent behind you / And even finer on your chest; / I’d like it to be broad and heavy / If it caused no loss or harm — / But there’s not a button or a hole in it /That didn’t cost some poor man a coin.”)

Bighouse, it is said, never forgave Rob those last two lines.

Following a further move, to Allt Coire Fhreasgail on the west side of the Kyle of Durness, Rob joined the Sutherland Highlanders in 1759 – mainly, one assumes, because it allowed him the freedom to wear the Highland dress and to carry and use a gun, but also because he received from officers and men alike the respect due to a poet and entertainer.

On his return home in 1763 he became Lord Reay’s cattleman at Balnacille for a time, but found the work beneath his dignity and left. The family moved to Achumore, then to Saingo, and from 1770 to

[TD 431]

1776 he was employed by Iain mac Eachainn’s son Col. Hugh MacKay at Balnacille. Finally they moved to Nuybig, where he died in 1778.

Every place Rob Donn had ever lived, except during military service, was in the single parish of Durness at the north-western tip of Scotland. There in his home district, despite the ravages of the Clearances and the virtual extinction of the Gaelic language, he remains as well regarded now for his brilliance, his fearlessness and his honesty as he was in his lifetime. Fifty years after his death, in 1829, a monument to him was erected at the west end of Durness church, and 207 of his poems – more than three times as many as survive of the work of any other eighteenth-century Gaelic poet – were published in Inverness by the Rev. Dr Mackintosh MacKay (a splendid editor) as Songs and Poems, in the Gaelic Language, by Robert MacKay, the Celebrated Bard of Lord Reay’s Country, Sutherlandshire. This, with its succinct introductory notes to the poems, laid a firm basis for subsequent editions, notably Hew Morrison’s Songs and Poems in the Gaelic Language by Rob Donn (Edinburgh, 1899), which contains 19 elegies and 200 other poems and songs, and the more selective Òrain agus Dàin le Rob Donn Mac-Aoidh by the Rev. Adam Gunn and Malcolm MacFarlane (Glasgow, 1899), which includes music in sol-fa notation and some translations. Rob Donn studies took a less textual and more analytical direction in the twentieth century, with Ian Grimble’s unique The World of Rob Donn (Edinburgh, 1979) and Donald John MacLeod’s ‘The Poetry of Rob Donn Mackay’, in Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 12, part 1 (1971), pp. 3–21.

Rob Donn’s poetry is an acquired taste. His language is difficult, because he uses his Sutherland dialect with great freedom. Perhaps his subject-matter lacks instant appeal. He has much to say about obscure individuals. One extreme view is that of the ever-forthright John Mackenzie (SO 187):

As a poet he cannot be placed in the highest rank. He is deficient in pathos and invention. There is little depth of feeling, and very slender powers of description to be found in his works; and, when the temporary and local interest wears away, he can never be a popular poet.


On the other hand, a Marxist critic, Donald John MacLeod, declared in ‘The Poetry of Rob Donn Mackay’, p. 3, that in his opinion Rob Donn was ‘the greatest pre-20th century Gaelic writer’.

It is possible, however, that Mackenzie’s comment tells us more about Mackenzie than about Rob Donn. Rob Donn’s poetry had been so comprehensively edited by Mackintosh MacKay that Mackenzie was left very little to do. MacKay’s introduction to the present poem, for example, tells us all we will ever know about it.

(“A LOVE SONG, Which the poet made to his beloved, Ann Morrison, a much admired young girl, and the poet’s first love: He had long been courting her, she being somewhat ambivalent, neither rejecting nor refusing him; but once when he went to the shieling where she was at the time, he saw her in the company of the fair-haired Carpenter, whose name was John Murray, and took it very badly that she should reject him. She subsequently married the fair-haired Carpenter, and if what the people say is to be believed – she was never glad that she had rejected Rob Donn; nor did the fair-haired Carpenter prove himself to be a particularly agreeable husband.”)


Vanquished in the story-telling contest, the irrepressible Mackenzie fell back upon editorial meddling, reorganising our poem into peculiar 12-line stanzas which were never seen before or since, and adding a little repetition like ‘Heich! &c.’ at the end of each to show that he knew the tune.

I take our song from pp. 210–11 of Mackintosh MacKay’s edition. It is also in SO 201–02, p. 8 of Gunn’s and MacFarlane’s, and pp. 148–50 of Morrison’s. Morrison offers a number of variant readings, some of which I note below, and presents the verses in a different order. Grimble, in The World of Rob Donn, pp. 16–18 and 210–11, reprints it with a translation, describing it as ‘the earliest poem that exhibits the range of Rob Donn’s talent in its full originality and intricacy’; he refers in particular to the poet’s ‘unromantic modernity, his life-like range of moods, his candid phallic imagery, the bantering tone of his farewell’.

12 Morrison gives: A dh’fhàg air bheag tàth mi, ge nàr e ri sheinn (‘That’s robbed me of strength, though it’s shameful to sing it’).

17–18 In Morrison’s version these lines are transposed with 23–24.

24 Morrison’s reading is mus fàg thu an tìr (‘before you leave this land’).

34–35 All sources except SO have ràth in line 35, but I do not understand it. Morrison has ’S saoilidh mi gur gaol sin nach caochail a-chaoidh, / ’S théid air a ràth, gun dh’fhàs e as ùr (‘And I believe that’s a love that will never change, / And it is declared(?), that it’s grown once again’).


27. Marbhrann do Rob Ruadh MacGriogair

The celebrated Rob Roy MacGregor (1671–1734) was third son of Dòmhnall Glas, chief of the Clann Dùghaill Chéir MacGregors of Glengyle on the Perthshire–Stirlingshire border. The MacGregors’ name had been proscribed by crown and parliament since 1603, and

[TD 433]

they had effectively become a confederation of tribes, of which the Glengyle family were one. Rob Roy was of a type which has come in some ways to epitomise the Highlander of his period, and his status is close in the public mind to that of Robin Hood. Well educated in the modern sense while adhering to all the traditional values inculcated by the ceilidh-house through the sort of poetry presented above, he was a master of the martial arts of his day. He lived his life in difficult terrain by lifting and resetting cattle, and by protecting the cattle of those individuals with whom he had a contract for the payment of màl dubh (‘black rent’, ‘black mail’) The latter activity, also referred to in poem 47, line 78, was dignified by the title of freiceadan (‘watch’), and has been described by one of his biographers (W. H. Murray, in Rob Roy MacGregor: His Life and Times (1995 edn, Edinburgh), p. 60) as ‘irregular in law rather than illegal, for it was sanctioned by government’.

Rob Roy’s terrain was the square of mountainous land between Loch Lomond to the west, Loch Ard in the Trossachs to the south, Dugald Buchanan’s Strathyre to the east, and Glen Dochart in Breadalbane to the north, but his activities brought him all over the Highlands and Lowlands. His principal interest was a highly profitable Lowland watch, but this inevitably put him into conflict with his neighbour and feudal superior, the Duke of Montrose. His biographers have catalogued an astonishing series of daring escapes from the custody of the dukes of Montrose and Atholl. With Argyll and Breadalbane, on the other hand, he lived on good terms, and for legal purposes he took their name of Campbell. He lived variously in Glengyle, at Craigrostan on Loch Lomondside, under Breadalbane’s protection at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart, under Argyll’s protection in Glen Shira, and finally at Inverlochlarig in Balquhidder.

Rob Roy was a lifelong Jacobite. He fought at Killiecrankie in 1689 with his father and brothers, led a mixed band of 250 MacGregors and MacPhersons at Sheriffmuir in 1715, and distinguished himself by bringing forty MacGregors north to fight with Seaforth at Glenshiel in 1719. He is described like this in an anonymous song at pp. 96–103 of MacCallum’s collection (1821), set to the air of ‘Gaoir nam Ban Muileach’ and entitled ‘Òran nam Fineachan Gaidhealach, air sheòl ùr, sam bheil an t-ùghdar a’ cumhadh àrmainn a thréig’ (‘A Song of the Highland Clans, in a new style, in which the author laments the heroes of the past’):

(“There would join you MacGregor / Called Rob Roy with his war-band, / To men of steel a fine leader /Who would raid the nobility, / Get the better of dukes, / And lift the rents of the tenants / Without oppressing the poor — / He it is who would win on the field, / He it is who would win on the field.”)

After converting to Catholicism, Rob Roy MacGregor died at Inverlochlarig on 28 December 1734. He was buried at the parish church of Balquhidder on New Year’s Day, 1735. His monuments in stone and bronze are there and at Stirling Castle, while his literary monuments are Sir Walter Scott’s rather strange novel Rob Roy and our poem – I cannot call it a song because its tune is unknown to me. There is also a raft of biographies and films, many of them wildly inaccurate, beginning with Daniel Defoe’s The Highland Rogue, which was published during its subject’s lifetime in 1723.

I take the poem mainly from the Stewart collection of 1804, pp. 301–04, but have also entered minor improvements from EUL MS Mackinnon 10C (Benjamin Urquhart), ff. 353r–354v (pp. 15–18). There is a version of 24 stanzas in GUL MacLagan MS 73, and one of 10 stanzas in GUL MacLagan MS 129B. The latter is printed by Ruaraidh MacThòmais, ‘Bho Làmh-Sgrìobhainnean MhicLathagain (VI)’, Gairm 118 (An t-Earrach 1982), pp. 150–54: 153. It provides a number of variant readings and one extra stanza, which I print as lines 16–18. A version in the Menzies collection of 1870, pp. 255–58, was taken from Stewart.

15 MacLagan MS 129B has: S math thig breacan an cuaich is claidheamh dhuit (‘A plaid in folds and a sword look well on you’).

24 At his death in 1734 Rob Roy left an estate worth £284 3s 4d Scots, of which his ‘saddle and arms and bridle’ were valued at £24. See Murray’s Rob Roy MacGregor, p. 264.

27 Mary MacGregor, Comer, whom he married in 1693.

37 Griogar Glùndubh (1689–1777) was son of Rob Roy’s eldest brother John. He was chief of the MacGregors of Glengyle from 1702. Rob Roy served as Tutor of Glengyle until he came of age c. 1707. His epithet is said to refer to a black mark on his knee. For a poem about his exploits as a Jacobite officer in 1746 see EUL MS Mackinnon 10C (Benjamin Urquhart), ff. 418r–419r.

43–44 Rob Roy had five sons, James (1695–1754), Coll (1698–1745), Duncan (1704 – post 1753), Ronald (1706–86) and Robert (Roban Òg, ‘Young Robbie’, 1716–54). Coll is probably put first because James and Ronald had been, in W. H. Murray’s words (Rob Roy MacGregor, p. 258), ‘following a career of black mail with violence that their father would never have tolerated’. The poet refers wryly to ‘towers’ because James and Ronald used as one of their bases a ruined castle on a peninsula at the

[TD 435]

east end of Loch Voil in Balquhidder. Here, in 1731, they had sheltered a Jacobite party from Edinburgh bringing the abducted Lady Grange to the Western Isles. James went on to serve as a major in the Jacobite army in 1745–46. He fought with conspicuous gallantry at Prestonpans. Coll prospered as a farmer in Balquhidder, and died at home in 1745.

43–46 MacLagan MS 129B names the sons wrongly as Colla, Seumas glan ùr (‘fine noble James’), Iain and Raibeard.

45 Robert was indeed in his ancestors’ mould. In 1736, the year after our poem, he murdered John MacLaren of Invernenty. In 1745 he fought under Cumberland at Fontenoy. In 1750, led by his brother James and accompanied by his brother Duncan, he kidnapped a young heiress, Jean Key, from her home near Balfron and married her by force at Rowardennan. For this crime he was hanged, while Duncan was found not guilty, and James escaped from Edinburgh Castle as his verdict was being considered, only to die soon after in poverty in Paris. See Sir Walter Scott’s Rob Roy (1893 edn, London), pp. lxxxiv–xcix, or his Manners, Customs, and History of the Highlanders of Scotland & Historical Account of the Clan MacGregor (1993 edn, New York), pp. 182–209.

46 There is a touch of ‘prodigal son’ about this line. In 1732 Ronald settled down with a tack of a farm at the Kirkton of Balquhidder obtained for him by his father. Next year he married a daughter of Griogar Glùndubh. He justified the trust placed in him. Says Murray (Rob Roy MacGregor, p. 259): “He limed the land, built a two-storey house, and held the tack for the next 54 years.”

47–48 The MacGregor badge (worn on the bonnet) was pine.

49–51 A rather different version of this stanza concludes the poem in MacLagan MS 129B:

<gai>
Nuair théid meur air an t-sùil,
Nuair théid an teanga o lùth,
Gum bi caib’ agus ùir gar feitheamh-ne.
<eng>

(“When finger touches the eye, / When strength leaves the tongue, / Spade and soil will be waiting for all of us.”)

64 John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1678–1743), the victor of Sheriffmuir and (despite this) Rob Roy’s friend and protector. Duniquoich is the prominent hill behind his castle at Inveraray.

69 I cannot imagine what this refers to.


28. Litir Iain Ruaidh

There is something of the warrior poet John Roy Stewart (1700–49), I think, in the swashbuckling Allan Breck Stewart of R. L. Stevenson’s

[TD 436]

novel Kidnapped. John Roy was born at Knock, Kincardine, Strathspey (near the modern village of Aviemore), into a well-to-do family which had traditionally held the Barony of Kincardine. He received a good education, and was long remembered for his youthful escapades. As shown in the notes on poem 33, his boisterous sense of humour never deserted him all his life.

In the 1720s he joined the Royal Scots Greys, a dragoon regiment, and rose to the rank of quartermaster. He failed to hide his Jacobite sympathies, however. This appears to have come to a head early in 1737 when the regiment was stationed at Fort George near Inverness. He was sent with a detachment to arrest Munro of Novar, who was suspected of being a Jacobite, but allowed him to escape. On returning to Fort George without his prisoner he could give no satisfactory account of his conduct. He was arrested and imprisoned on a charge of treason, but obtained his release through the connivance of Simon, Lord Lovat. He subsequently went to France, but before doing so, according to Peter Rose (NLS MS 14898, f. 67v), he lived for a while at Faskally in Atholl, and carried on a correspondence with Lovat in French, and with ‘Mrs Fraser Bruach or Downie’ in Gaelic.

John Roy had a reputation as a ladies’ man. While at Fort George he helped arrange a ‘mesalliance’ between the Earl of Moray’s brother and a Miss Barber, see W. Drummond-Norie, ‘Famous Highland Bards. No. V. – John “Roy” Stuart’, The Celtic Monthly, vol. 3 (1895), pp. 114–16: 115. And his cousin bailie John Steuart of Inverness tells of an incident in Flanders which appears to have taken place early in 1745.

There was a letter came here last post from Liutenant Menzies, of the Highland Regiment abroad, to his Broyr. Niel, who is a doctor here, in which he advises that his Lady, being in Gehent [Ghent] when it was taken by the French laitly, and being attacked in her Lodging by some ffrench soldiers who wanted to plunder her, had the good fortune to light by accident on our acquaintance John Roy St … who got her immediatly rid of the Plumderers, showed her great civilities, and procured her letters of safe conduct to go to England, or where she pleased. John was in Highland Dress when this happened. (William Mackay (ed.), The Letter-Book of Bailie John Steuart of Inverness 1715-1752 (Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1915), p. 454)


Mrs Barbara Fraser is the author of two poems published in Turner’s collection (1813). The first (pp. 276–78) speaks of how, after the death of her husband and eldest son, she was forced to move from Dounie to Achanaclaidhe in the braes of the Aird. The second is a dialogue about drink between a man and his wife, to the tune “’S mise th’air mo bhodh’radh / Le solas na h-obair nogha, &c.” [sic]. We may translate this as: ‘I’m completely deafened / By the pleasure of sex’, see pp. 22, 374.

1 The Aird is the Fraser territory west of Inverness.

29. An Teàrnadh Mìorbhaileach

John MacKay, tacksman of Mudale in Strathnaver (c. 1690 – c. 1750), was of the Halmadary branch of the Abrach MacKays. We know little of his life except that on 10 February 1736 he received a tack of ‘the third part of the town and lands of Mudale’, and that he took part on the Hanoverian side in the ’45 as an ensign in the Sutherland militia.

In the weeks before Culloden, a 300-strong Jacobite detachment under Lord Cromartie and his son Lord Macleod had been gathering recruits to the cause in Caithness. On their way back south on 15 April 1746, the little force – minus its leaders – was surrounded and taken prisoner by our poet and his men as it attempted to cross the Little Ferry between Golspie and Dornoch. Discovering that Cromartie and Macleod had been detained at Dunrobin, Mudale marched north to the castle. “It was said that after the men had been taken prisoner, the poet entered Dunrobin castle, pistol in hand, and searched for the Earl of Cromartie until he found him hiding under a bed.” It seems that the Countess of Sutherland had entertained her unwelcome guests so well that Mudale was able to capture them with fifteen other officers while drinking and carousing (Ian Grimble, The World of Rob Donn (Edinburgh, 1979), pp. 25, 68–69).

According to John Rose’s Metrical Reliques of ‘The Men’ in the Highlands (Inverness, 1851), pp. 109–10, later that year a party of Sutherland militia were stationed in Rannoch, where they got to know Dugald Buchanan (for whom see poem 45) and sang Mudale’s poems to him. “He often sang them cheerfully and with great glee; and it is said that it was these poems that moved Dugald to compose the excellent hymns of which he was the author.” Mudale’s surviving work consists mainly of four substantial religious poems, which are discussed by the Rev. Dr John MacInnes in The Evangelical Movement in the Highlands of Scotland (Aberdeen, 1951), pp. 283–84. Given the cultural and religious climate of Sutherland in his day, we may guess that a man of Mudale’s status saw it as his social duty to use his gifts to educate his people in the mysteries of the faith.

Donald Johnston says at p. 3 of his Dain Spioradail that Mudale was Iain mac Iain mhic Raibeirt, and Rose gives him as Iain mac Iain mhic Raibeirt mhic Mhurchaidh, whereas in an elegy taken by Ian Grimble to be addressed to him, ‘Marbhrann do Iain MacAoidh’ (‘An Elegy on John MacKay’), Rob Donn refers to his subject as Iain fàilteach mac Raibeirt mhic Nèill – ‘Hospitable John son of Robert son of Neil’. Rob Donn lists a series of exclusively secular virtues and refers to John MacKay not as a poet but as a patron of poets (ceanna cliar), then concludes with the words:

<gai>
’S mur fìor domh na thubhairt
Mun a’ Chrìostaidh bu mhutha,
Leigeam ’fhianais air Muthadail fhéin.
<eng>

[TD 438]

(“And if what I’ve said is untrue / About the greatest Christian, / I refer to Mudale himself as his witness.”) It seems to me, then, that Grimble was wrong in believing that the subject of the elegy was John MacKay of Mudale. See Adam Gunn’s and Malcolm MacFarlane’s Songs and Poems by Rob Donn Mackay (Glasgow, 1899), p. 19, and Grimble’s The World of Rob Donn, p. 88, where six of the ten stanzas are translated.

According to Rose, Mudale composed our song ‘on a fine moonlight night in harvest, while he happened to be out in the fields, lying on his back, contemplating the glory and majesty of the heavenly luminaries’. MacInnes describes it as a narration of the story of redemption against the background of creation and history, following a pattern whose perfect exemplar is ‘Laoidh MhicEalair’ (poem 25). I take it from pp. 9–14 of Donald Johnston’s Dain Spioradail, le Ùghdairibh Eug-Samhuil; maille ri geàrrchunntas mu Iain Mac Aoidh, a bh’ann an Dùthaich MhicAoidh, agus mu Dhùghall Buchanan, a bh’ann an Raineach (Inverness, 1835), and from Rose’s Metrical Reliques, pp. 110–15. Linguistically speaking, its most distinctive feature is the repeated non-relative use of the preverbal particle a (earlier do). Rose says that it is sung to the tune of ‘Se fulangas mo shlànaigheir / A bhios mo dhàn a’ luaidh’.

30 For suidheachadh Johnston has element: ‘As an element to last’?

73–74 Johnston gives: Tha gach creutair ’tàmh ’nan element / Mar rinneadh iad an tòs (‘All creatures stay in their element / As they were first created’).

30. An Litir gun Chéir Oirr’

For the poet see poem 24. In An Laoidheadair Gaelic (Glasgow, 1834), pp. 65–82, Duncan Kennedy published six hymns by a Christian lady, Mrs Campbell of Barr in Morvern, afterwards of Barr in Craignish, where she died aged about 70. He says (pp. 64–65):

She was daughter of Mr Duncan Campbell, a respected Notary and Conveyancer, commonly known by the name of Donnacha dubh Notair. He and his partner, Mr Campbell of Rudle, commanded as conveyancers, almost the whole business of Argyleshire to themselves. Our Authoress, when young, was a zealous friend to the Hanoverian Family, and in the year 1745, composed a masterly Song against Prince Charles’ pretensions to the crown. This Song provoked Alexander McDonald, the celebrated Hebridian bard, to reply, and he composed a Song in a severe and most abusive style, which silenced her poetical muse forever. Had she not met with this severe and offensive check, she might have been induced to persevere in composing Songs, and

[TD 439]

have been considered equal, if not superior to Mairi Nic Leoid in Skye, commonly known by the name of Mairi Nighin Alastair Ruadh, and encomiastically Mairi Seud. She was possessed of a store of similies, imageries, and metaphors that Mairi Seud or Mairearad Nighin Ailein (Margaret McLean), in Mull, had no access to for want of education. Bean a Bharra turned her whole thoughts to futurity and sacred subjects.


Regrettably, Mrs Campbell’s song against Prince Charles has failed to survive, although we can deduce from Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s more studied responses to it that she questioned his legitimacy, called his followers prasgan nan Garbh-Chrìoch (‘the rabble of the Highlands’), and even spoke disparagingly of the Gentle Lochiel. However, the second of her six ‘angelic meditations’ (as Kennedy calls them) could well be aimed at Mac Mhaighstir Alastair. It begins: Ciod as t’ uaill, a dhuine bhorb! (‘What is your pride, O wild man!’) and contains the following:

<gai>
A-nis, a ghaisgich, caisg do mhiann
’S fuadaich gaoth fhiar ás do sheòl:
Tilg t’ acair air carraig bhuan
Nach fheudar fhuasgladh le h-òr.
<eng>

(“Now, O warrior, staunch your desire / And banish ill wind from your sail: / Drop your anchor on a steadfast rock / That cannot be made loose by gold.”) The reference to gold may be relevant to the present case. Mac Mhaighstir Alastair had begun a career in the law, but turned to schoolmastering – poorly paid work by comparison. It seems clear that at some point in the 1730s he became a Jacobite agent, his task being to place his enormous literary gifts at the service of the cause, just as he had previously placed them at the service of the church in the interests of social control. When he slandered Mrs Campbell into silence, then, he was simply doing his duty in the accepted way of the time, and the Hanoverians of Argyll were quite entitled to assume that he was being paid for it; indeed, it is possible that her own father had discreetly handled payments to him for his literary services in the days when he was performing for the church (see p. xxxvi). The present poem is a mere sample of his fusillade, for pace Kennedy we have not one song by him against Bean a’ Bharra but three or four, see my Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: The Ardnamurchan Years (Coll, 1986), p. 39.

There is a tradition – naturally not referred to by Kennedy – that Mrs Campbell kept an inn or dram-shop in Oban called Taigh Clach a’ Gheòidh (‘Goose-Stone House’). This is why Alastair calls her in one poem òstag mhì-nàrach an Òbain (‘the shameless innkeeper of Oban’), while in another he deals like this with the tricky problem of how Prince Charles could at one and the same time be the legitimate heir to the throne and the ‘bastard from out of the west’ prophesied by Thomas Rhymer to be the saviour of the Gael (Revs A. and A. Macdonald (eds), The Poems of Alexander MacDonald (Inverness, 1924), pp. xx, 250, 330):

(“Of the secret coming of Prince Charles, / Meaningful’s the comet’s warning / That some unblemished aristocrat / Was fast approaching our shore; / There’s many a valid word of weight / In Thomas’s precise prophecy / From which it’s seen to be no deserved subject / For a poetess from a tavern.”) See also poem 33, lines 27–28.

I take the poem from Alexander MacDonald, Aiseiridh na Sean Chanoin Albannaich (5th edn, ed. John Mackenzie, Glasgow, 1839), p. 204. It provides a simple example of the poet’s favourite technique: each stanza contains a fresh image, be it (as here) tanning, pigs or the harp, whose potential he explores against the requirements of the task in hand.

10 Céir, ‘wax’, is a term much used in traditional verse for the white buttocks of the deer, cf. poem 49, lines 13, 66; also for the buttocks more generally, poem 53, line 84.

29–32 The boar of the Campbell arms provided Mac Mhaighstir Alastair with a rich seam of imagery. It tied in neatly with porcine portrayals of the Hanoverian royal family, cf. poem 31, note on line 12. Never afraid to go over the top, he piles lesbianism upon bestialism.

31. Clann Chatain an t-Sròil

Following his arrival in France c. 1737, John Roy Stewart (for whom see poem 28) appears to have joined a regiment of Jacobite exiles called the Écossais Royales, and on 11 May 1745 he fought against a British force led by the Duke of Cumberland at Fontenoy in Flanders. On hearing later that summer that Prince Charles had landed in Scotland, he travelled home immediately to offer his services. He was asked to raise an ‘Edinburgh Regiment’, which in fact consisted mainly of men from Perthshire and Strathspey, and he took part with it in all the actions of the rising. He had a prominent role in the council-of-war on the morning of Culloden (16 April 1746), recommending a day’s truce, and agreeing to lead a detachment to attack the enemy in the rear – a

[TD 441]

sensible plan which was ultimately not put into effect. He fought heroically, however, and one of many excellent anecdotes about him (SO 264) has the Duke of Cumberland pointing him out and enquiring who he was. “Ah!” replies an aide-de-camp. “That is John Roy Stewart.”

“Good God!” says the Duke. “The man I left in Flanders doing the butcheries of ten heroes. Is it possible that he could have dogged me here?”

As one of the Jacobites’ best military strategists, he had apparently hoped to be given the leadership of the army on the day, but was disappointed in this as in much else, and his bitterness is reflected in his remarks about Lord George Murray at lines 34–42. According to John Mackenzie (SO 265) he was so convinced of Lord George’s treachery that he rushed from rank to rank meaning to ‘hew the traitor to pieces’. Prince Charles, who had taken personal command following Murray’s abortive ‘night march to Nairn’, delayed the attack until his troops, shivering on open ground in wind and sleet and tormented by enemy cannon, could wait no longer. The Clan Chattan led the charge in the centre, with the Camerons on the right and the MacDonalds on the left. They had little chance. The Clan Chattan suffered the most horrendous casualties of all, losing fourteen officers. John Mackenzie wrote in Eachdraidh a’ Phrionnsa (2nd edn, Paisley, 1906), p. 124:

<gai>
Bu cho mòr an t-àr a rinneadh a measg nan Gàël man am sin is gun d’fhuaradh ann an iomadach àite dheth an àraich truir a’s ceathrar dhiu na laidhe marbh air muin a cheile. Dheth na phrasgan threun de Chlann-Chatain a chuir bain-Tighearna Mhic-an-tòisich fo’n armachd, cha do phill a dh-aithris an sgeoil ach ma dheich ’ar fhichead agus triùir oifigeach.
<eng>

(“The slaughter made amongst the Highlanders at that point was so great that in many parts of the battlefield three or four of them were found lying one on top of the other. Of the heroic Clan Chattan contingent that Lady Macintosh had put under arms, only thirty men and three officers returned to tell the tale.”)


Six of John Roy’s twelve surviving poems, and many of the stories about him, date from the time after Culloden when he was in hiding in his native Strathspey. Three of these are on Culloden itself. The two best known are those called by J. L. Campbell (Highland Songs of the ’45, pp. 168–85) ‘Latha Chùil Lodair’ (‘Culloden Day’) and ‘Òran Eile air Latha Chùil Lodair’ (‘Another Song on Culloden Day’). I have chosen to print the second of these, for several reasons: it is an excellent song, traditionally the most popular of all his works; it offers a good eye-witness description of this most pivotal battle of Highland history and of its impact on a specific community; and it is now available in a much fuller version than that published by Campbell. Watson, when printing both Culloden songs in BGh 87–94, had entitled them respectively ‘Latha Chùil-Lodair agus Cor nan Gaidheal’ (‘The Battle of Culloden and the Plight of the Gael’) and ‘Latha Chùil-Lodair’

[TD 442]

(‘The Battle of Culloden’); to try to end this confusion, I have chosen to emphasise the societal perspective of this longer version of the second song by calling it ‘Clann Chatain an t-Sròil’ (see line 75).

The song was published in Turner’s collection of 1813, pp. 304–08 (31 verses), which provided the basis for several subsequent editions: SO 266–67; Thomas Sinton, The Poetry of Badenoch (Inverness, 1906), pp. 194–99 and 467–70; BGh 91–94; and Campbell’s Highland Songs of the ’45, pp. 176–85. For The Poems of John Roy Stewart (Edinburgh, 1947), pp. 24–33, Elizabeth Mackechnie used a version in the MacLagan MSS to establish a text of 44 verses. EUL MS Mackinnon 10C (Benjamin Urquhart), ff. 347v–350r (pp. 6–11), gives 32 verses, including one which does not appear in any other source (our lines 82–84). I have used it to establish a text of 45 verses, with a number of improved or alternative readings. NLS MS 14898 (Peter Rose), f. 65, offers a version of our lines 1–12 and 22–42, but is difficult to read. I owe some of the biographical information printed above to Neil Macgregor’s unpublished MA dissertation, ‘Contributions towards an Edition of the Works of John Roy Stewart’ (Department of Celtic, University of Edinburgh, 1983).

12 Urquhart has mac na muice, ‘the pig’s son’. The use of porcine imagery for the Hanoverian royal family was a standard element of Jacobite discourse in Gaelic verse, cf. poem 30, note on lines 29–32.

13 Sinton (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 196) footnotes this line by telling of a popular tradition that king George had a pig’s snout and ate from a silver trough.

25–28 See notes on poem 29. Lord Cromartie had with him in Sutherland, in addition to his own MacKenzies, the MacKinnons, the MacGregors of Glengyle, and some of the Clanranald MacDonalds under young Barrisdale.

31 The MacPhersons, hurrying north from Badenoch, were still six miles away when the battle was fought.

34–42 See Joshua 7: 18–26. The accusation that Lord George Murray was a traitor is entirely unfounded. Sinton explains (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 198):

Lord George Murray – now generally acknowledged to have been the strongest man in the Jacobite army – was distrusted by a section of the Prince’s followers who favoured the Duke of Perth. Chiefly in consequence of the intrigues of Mr Secretary [John] Murray, even Charles, for a time, believed him capable of treachery. These suspicions were wholly groundless, but did incalculable injury to the common cause. The jealousy and bickerings of the chiefs occasioned a spirit of discord and insubordination throughout the entire army. After Culloden, not a few of the discomfited Jacobites endeavoured to preserve their amour propre by attributing their defeat to treachery. And

[TD 443]

so with Colonel Stewart, who was, besides, a partisan of the Duke of Perth.

75 The Clan Chattan comprised mainly Macintoshes, MacGillivrays and MacBeans.

76–81 Lt.-Col. Alexander MacGillivray of Dunmaglass, head of the MacGillivrays, who led the Clan Chattan at Culloden, was an exceptionally handsome man and a gallant soldier (BGh 286). His fate was reported thus to the Rev. Robert Forbes, The Lyon in Mourning, vol. 3 (ed. Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1896), pp. 55–56:

The gentleman whose body was taken up twenty days after it was coverd with a litle earth was James Dallas of Cantray, a loyall, kind, brave young man, who rais’d his company at a great expence to serve his royall master … The other was Alexander McGillevry of Dumnaglass who was more than six weeks unburied, and without smell. He was collonell of the Clan Chatton, the Mackintoshes, in this country. I may add many have not produced a finer youth. Had all acted the part that these two gallent young gentlemen did with Gallish McBain, major, Angus McIntosh of Far, Alexander McGillevry and Robert McGillevry, all three captains (who fell upon the field) and the rest of the clan with some others, that day would have brought forth other things than it did.

82–84 Capt. Angus Macintosh of Farr in Strathnairn, see note on lines 76–81. Line 84 refers to his conviviality.

85–86 See Rev. Robert Forbes, The Lyon in Mourning, vol. 2 (ed. Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1895), p. 305:

McGillavry of Delcrombie, who was not ingag’d with the Prince, being at two miles distance from the field of battle without any arms, was attacked by dragoons, who oblidged him to cast of all his cloaths and give them to them to prevent their dismounting, his cloaths being too good for them to part with; and then they shot him dead. If they had had but swords and he one, he would have given 2 or 3 of them enough of it.

97–102 Major Gillies MacBean, see note on lines 76–81.

111 This line is missing in all sources. I have tentatively supplied it on the basis of rhyme.

121–32 Campbell points out in Highland Songs of the ’45, p. 185: “The Duke of Cumberland died unmarried in 1765, all his brothers having predeceased him. His military career subsequent to Culloden was very unsuccessful, and for the last ten years of his life he was extremely unpopular.”

128 Urquhart’s Ach dòlas dona mu d’ cheann (‘But evil grief round your head’) gives improved rhyme seanns : cheann : Chlann.


32. Mo Rùn Geal Òg

This very fine song was first printed at pp. 440–44 of the Stewart collection of 1804, which, as J. L. Campbell has pointed out (Gaelic Folksongs from the Isle of Barra, p. 49), ‘was the first book in which genuine Gaelic Jacobite poetry was printed after the suppression of the book of songs printed by Alexander MacDonald in 1751’. The Stewarts headed it: ‘Oran cumhaidh le mnaoi uasail ann an Srath Ghlais d’a Fear fein, dha ’m b’ ainm Gilliosa Mac Bheathan, air dha tuiteam ann an Cuilodair’ (‘A lament by a lady in Strathglass for her own Husband, whose name was Gillies MacBean, after his death at Culloden’). For MacBean and his heroic death see poem 31, lines 97–102, and Robert Chambers, History of the Rebellion of 1745–6 (7th edn, Edinburgh, 1869), p. 301.

The Inverness collection of 1806, pp. 163–66, repeated the heading but dropped the statement that the dead man’s name was Gillies MacBean. The song was next published in MacDonald’s collection of 1821, pp. 167–71, where it is headed: ‘Cumha do Rob Ruadh Mac Ghillebhra, Fear Srath-Ghlas, a thuit an Cuilodair. Le Bhean Fein.’ (‘A Lament for Rob Roy MacGillivray, Tacksman of Strathglass, who fell at Culloden. By his Own Wife.’) MacGillivray, like MacBean, is a name that we would associate with Strathnairn and the Clan Chattan rather than with Strathglass, where the Chisholms reigned supreme. So far it would appear that the Stewart brothers and MacDonald were in confusion between four of the greatest heroes of Culloden, all of Clan Chattan, and all mentioned in the quotation in the note on poem 31, lines 76–81 – Lt.-Col. Alexander MacGillivray of Dunmaglass, Gillies MacBean, Robert MacGillivray of Dalziel, and Alastair Ruadh

[TD 445]

MacGillivray. Strathglass will be a misunderstanding for Dunmaglass.

In reprinting the song in 1841, however (SO 373–74), John Mackenzie held firm to the Strathglass connection, thus raising the curious possibility that this was the only thing that the Stewarts and MacDonald had got right. Mackenzie ascribed it to Christiana Fergusson, wife of William Chisholm, tacksman of Innis nan Ceann in Strathglass. This version has since been accepted as genuine by J. L. Campbell (Gaelic Folksongs from the Isle of Barra, p. 49), among others, presumably on the basis of the highly circumstantial nature of Mackenzie’s information, which is as follows.

Christiana Fergusson … was a native of the Parish of Contin, Ross-shire, where her father was a blacksmith – chiefly employed in making dirks and other implements of war. She was married to a brave man of the name of William Chisholm, a native of Strathglas, and a near kinsman of the Chief of that name.

On the memorable day of Culloden, William was flag-bearer or banner-man of the clan; and most assuredly the task of preserving the “Bratach Choimheach” from the disgrace of being struck down, could not have fallen into better hands. He fought long, and manfully; and even after the retreat became general, he rallied and led his clansmen again and again to the charge, but in vain.

A body of the Chisholms ultimately sought shelter in a barn, which was soon surrounded by hundreds of the red-coats who panted for blood. At this awful conjuncture William literally cut his way through the government forces. He then stood in the barn door, and with his trusty blade, high raised, and in proud defiance, guarded the place. In vain did their spears and bayonets aim their thrusts at his fearless breast – he hewed down all who came within reach of his sword, and kept a semicircle of eight feet clear for himself in the teeth of his desperate enemies. At length he was shot by some Englishmen, who climbed up to the top of the barn from behind, where he fell as a hero would wish to fall, with seven bullets lodged in his body.


By Bratach Choimheach, Mackenzie presumably means not ‘Foreign Banner’ but ‘Fierce Banner’, in the sense in which coimheach is used in poem 22, line 61. It can probably be assumed that the Chisholm banner portrayed the boar’s head of the Chisholm arms with their motto ‘Feros ferio’ (‘I smite the fierce animal’). The Chisholm origin-legend tells of a wild boar that was terrorising the district; two men cornered it in Glenconvinth, and when it attacked one of them he thrust his hand down its throat and dragged out its tongue and stomach, whereupon the other said, Sith salach! (“A filthy grasp!”) This then is the folk etymology of Siosalach ‘a Chisholm’, see Alexander Mackenzie, History of the Chisholms (Inverness, 1891), p. 10.

On the strength of John Mackenzie’s information, a stone slab has been erected to the memory of William Chisholm and Christiana Fergusson on the east bank of the Glass near Mauld. It has to be said that there is no trace of William of Innis nan Ceann in any serious

[TD 446]

historical work on the Chisholms or on Culloden which I have seen, and that the statement that he carried the clan banner at Culloden is contradicted by Alexander Mackenzie’s information (History of the Chisholms, p. 222) that their standard-bearer at the battle was John Macdonald, Iain na Brataich, who survived long after the ’45 and eventually emigrated to Canada. All in all the ‘cult’ of William Chisholm seems suspiciously modern, and his story loses nothing in the telling. The following is from William MacKay’s Gaelic Place-Names of Upper Strathglass (Inverness, 1968), p. 5:

William Chisholm, the Clan Chisholm Standard Bearer at Culloden, lived at Mauld. The site of his house is said to be near the river below the Mauld–Eskadale road at a place called by the old people “Innis nan ceann” – the meadow of the heads – after some old Clan fight. William killed 16 men at Culloden with his broadsword, but was killed himself. His widow composed a Gaelic song in his memory, “Mo run geal og,” in which she says that he was the handsomest, bravest, kindliest man in Strathglass, the best swordsman, and had the sweetest kisses and the strongest head [sic] in the Strath. In the Beerhouse at Struy when all others were below the table he was still on his feet. A Stone at Mauld House inscribed “Mo run geal og,” erected by the Frasers of Mauld, commemorates him.


The only geographical clues offered by the poem itself point neither to Strathglass nor to Strathnairn but to Skye (line 92). This can easily be resolved, however, if we assume that the poet – whoever she was – fled to the safety of relatives in that island, as is extremely likely in the circumstances, and composed her lament there. At any rate, Mackenzie says that Christiana ‘devotes to the Prince one solitary expression of sympathetic condolence … and then, with the wings and wail of a mateless dove, flutters over the mangled carcass of her husband, and depicts his matchless person and soul in language that would melt the sternest heart to sympathy’.

As stated above, the song will be found in the Stewart, Inverness and MacDonald collections and in SO. It is also in J. L. Campbell’s booklet Gaelic Folksongs from the Isle of Barra (Linguaphone Institute, London, n.d.), pp. 16–21. Campbell had recorded it in 1938 from Roderick MacKinnon (Ruairidh Iain Bhàin, 1858–1944). This Barra version is remarkably similar to those published in the earlier collections, the main difference being that the stanzas are not in the same order. I take my text from Stewart while noting the more important variations.

5–8 The Stewarts, the Inverness collection and MacDonald have the text as given. SO, on the other hand, has:

<gai>
Cha chrodh is cha chaoirich
Tha mi caoidh, ach mo chéile,
Ged a dh’fhàgte mi ’m aonar
Gun sìon san t-saoghal ach léine.
<eng>

[TD 447]

(“It’s not cattle or sheep / That I keen, but my husband, / Were I left alone with nothing / In the world save a shirt.”) This is developed further in the Barra version:

<gai>
Cha bu chrodh ’s cha bu chaoirich
Tha mi caoidh, ach mo cheudghaol —
Sann a dh’fhàg thu mi ’m aonar
Gun sìon dhan t-saoghal ach léine.
<eng>

(“It was not cattle or sheep / That I keen, but my first love – / You have left me alone / With no world save a shirt.”) The substitution of sheep for kinsfolk presents in uncomfortable terms the change that took place in the Highlands and Islands between 1821 and 1841.

32 For donn (‘brown’) Ruairidh Iain Bhàin sings trom (‘thick’), which seems very real to me: the widow remembers how she used to run her hand through her husband’s hair.

33 Here is another little change that tells a story – although the Stewarts, the Inverness collection, MacDonald and SO have mhuineal (‘neck’), the Barra version substitutes mhullach (‘crown, top, head’). Perhaps Ruairidh Iain Bhàin could not visualise the long flowing locks favoured by well-born men in a more heroic era of Highland society.

39 While the reading in Stewart, the Inverness collection, MacDonald and SO is grammatically uncontroversial, the Barra version has No bhith sealgair a’ mhunaidh, which involves a syntactical issue identical to that in poem 57, line 27. Clearly the line was acceptable to Ruairidh Iain Bhàin.

52–53 The word mùthadh means literally ‘an alternative’, ‘a change’, ‘variety’. SO here has ’S cha d’iarr thu riamh cùis /Air té air chùl do mhnà pòsta (‘And you never sought an affair / From any woman behind your wife’s back’). I suspect this is Mackenzie’s own attempt to explain the point, but it is perfectly clear already.

56–62 The mixture of end-rhymes in é and ao in this stanza is normal in the traditional verse of the period. In this respect Ruairidh Iain Bhàin follows the Stewarts, the Inverness collection and MacDonald. In SO Mackenzie ‘fixed’ the problem by substituting éibhneas (‘rejoicing’) for faoilteachd, while for line 62 he gave simply Cha dealaich do spéis rium (‘I will always cherish you’).

71 The Barra version has: Cha tog caidreabh fir òig mi (‘No young man’s banter can lift me’). This has more piquancy, in my opinion.

[TD 448]

33. Ùrnaigh Iain Ruaidh

Following Culloden, Col. John Roy Stewart (for whom see poems 28 and 31) was on the run in his native Strathspey for five months. He had three or four caves and other hideouts, some of which were still known in the early 1980s when they were shown to Neil Macgregor. W. Drummond-Norie’s version of the story about how he sprained his ankle (‘Famous Highland Bards. No. V. – John “Roy” Stuart’, The Celtic Monthly, vol. 3 (1895), pp. 114–16: 116) has it that a boy (his son) was on his way to his hiding-place with a pitcher of milk when he encountered a party of redcoats. Feigning idiocy, the lad offered his milk to the drummer-boy if he would let him know ‘the use of the curious thing he carried on his back’. The officer gave permission, and the noise alerted John Roy.

According to the Rev. W. Forsyth (In the Shadow of Cairngorm (Inverness, 1900), p. 176), the poet had taught a boy called Peter Bell to play the drum as a code of warning. One day Peter was bringing some milk to John Roy’s cave in Glenmore when he met the redcoats. They had received a tip-off from an Irish informer. Persuading a soldier to let him play their drum, he began with an air whose words were:

<gai>
Buaidh thap leat, Iain Ruaidh,
Is tric a bhuail thu campaid.
<eng>

This will mean, I think, “Power of swiftness be yours, John Roy, / It’s often you’ve struck camp.” He followed this with a warning whose words were:

<gai>
Bi falbh ’s na fuirich,
Bi falbh, bi falbh,
Na tig a-nochd tuillidh,
Tha an tòir a’ tighinn thugad,
Na tig a-nochd tuillidh,
Bi falbh, bi falbh!
<eng>

(“Be away and don’t stay, / Be away, be away, / Don’t come back tonight, / The pursuit’s coming near you, / Don’t come back tonight, / Be away, be away!”) A more credible version has it that there was no pre-arranged signal – all that happened was that a boy who was standing guard, pretending to herd cattle, found himself face to face with the redcoats and bribed their drummer to give a rattle on his drum.

At any rate, the Colonel was warned. He leaped out of his cave at the sound, and, as Peter Rose tells us, ‘dislocated his ancle and only able to creep under the shad of a bush in the bank of a burn closs by, when all danger was over, he set to and put his ancle to rights leaning on the bank keeping his foot in the water he commenced his prayer’ (NLS MS 14898, f. 66v).

The enforced inactivity of our man of action led to two more ditties on the same subject. One, in English, was ‘John Roy Stewart’s Psalm’ in

[TD 449]

eight verses (SO 268, cf. MS 14898, f. 64r):

The Lord’s my targe, I will be stout
With dirk and trusty blade;
Though Campbells come in flocks about
I will not be afraid …

The other was, appropriately, a strathspey. It is about the eighteenth-century Highland equivalent of finding a doctor, cf. notes on poem 16. In this period more than at any time before or since, the practice of medicine in all the country districts of the Highlands and Islands was in the hands of women (NLS MS 14898, f. 67r):

<gai>
S fheudar dhomh bhith togail orm,
Gun bhith fuireach ach bhith falbh,
S fheudar dhomh bhith togail orm
’S lorg bhan ’s mi crùbach.

A mhnathan gaolach gràdhach cridheach,
Bithibh càirdeach, tha mi guidh’ oirbh,
Cuiribh plàsta ri mo luighean —
Ìm is luibheannan oirre.
<eng>

(“I really must be moving on, / Staying no more but moving on, / I really must be moving on / To find women as I’m crippled. / Loving caring cheerful women, / Be kind to me, I beg you, / Put a poultice on my ankle — / Put butter and put herbs on it.”)

In due course John Roy was contacted by his former comrades and brought to the Prince’s ‘cage’ on Ben Alder, for which see the notes to poem 47. An anecdote recorded by Neil Macgregor in Rothiemurchus in 1982 suggests that he had not lost his outrageous sense of humour. According to this, the Prince was sitting by a fire in the cage, miserable with dysentery, when John Roy arrived, went up quietly to him and said in Gaelic, “The game’s up!” The Prince nearly died of fright (Neil Macgregor, ‘Contributions towards an Edition of the Works of John Roy Stewart’, MA dissertation, Department of Celtic, University of Edinburgh, 1983, p. 17).

John Roy appears to have been in the party which sailed for France with the Prince about 20 September 1746. In the Inverness collection of 1806, pp. 162–63, there is an anonymous ‘Òran air Aiseirigh Iain Ruaidh’ (‘A Song on John Roy’s Resurrection’) in which the author says that he thought John Roy was dead; it ends:

<gai>
Nuair a bha thu ’d òganach
S lìonmhor àit’ am b’ eòlach thu —
Chunnaic mis’ an clòsaidean
Ag òl an Amsterdam thu.
<eng>

(“When you were a youth / It’s many places you knew — / I’ve seen you in closets / Drinking in Amsterdam.”) There were reported sightings of

[TD 450]

him in Scotland in 1747, as he tried to drum up support for another rising, but he was dead by September 1749, when his cousin, bailie John Steuart of Inverness, refers to John Roy’s widow at Boulogne – a Frenchwoman, perhaps. See William Mackay (ed.), The Letter-Book of Bailie John Steuart of Inverness 1715-1752 (Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1915), p. 462.

I take my text basically from: SO 268–69; Elizabeth Mackechnie, The Poems of John Roy Stewart (Edinburgh, 1947), pp. 34–37; Thomas Sinton, The Poetry of Badenoch (Inverness, 1906), pp. 203–05 and 473–74; and J. L. Campbell, Highland Songs of the ’45 (2nd edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 186–91. I have also noted one or two variants from the rather unsatisfactory version in Turner’s collection of 1813, pp. 151–52. There is a slightly different text in NLS MS 14878, pp. 209–10 (Rev. Alexander Irvine’s collection). NLS MS 14898 (Peter Rose), f. 66v, offers a very different version in 18 lines.

5 Campbells were known as Duibhnich or Guibhnich from their medieval surname Ó Duibhne. Duibhne was father of the celebrated Diarmad, for whom see poem 17. Some of our sources have Guimhnich, others Duibhnich or Duimhnich. See also poem 10, line 121.

9–11 For ubhaidh (Turner’s and Irvine’s versions have ubaidh), ‘a charm’, see notes on poem 6. Traditional charms were regularly ascribed in this way to scriptural figures, among whom Peter and Paul were a popular choice, see for example Alexander Carmichael, Carmina Gadelica, vol. 2 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1928), pp. 62, 64, 136. John Mackenzie points out in his inimitable way (SO 268) that he ‘well recollects with what self-complacency and sang froid the female Esculapii of his native glen used to repeat the “Eòlas sgiuchadh feithe,” over the hapless hobbler of sprained ankles’, and he goes on to cite charms for the cure of worms in the human body and against the evil eye. Carmichael gives two examples of eòlas sgiuchadh (or sgochadh) féithe, one of which indeed mentions seven prayers (or paters, or rosaries), although not to Peter and Paul but to the Blessed Virgin (Carmina Gadelica, vol. 2, pp. 14, 16). In the opinion of Alexander Macdonald (‘Gleannach’), the specific charm being referred to by John Roy was:

<gai>
Paidir a h-aon,
Paidir a dhà,
Paidir a trì,
Paidir a ceithir,
Paidir a cóig,
Paidir a sia,
Paidir a seachd,
’S neart nan seachd paidirean
A sgaoileadh do ghalair air na clachan glas ud thall.
<eng>

[TD 451]

(“Bead number one, / Bead number two, / Bead number three, / Bead number four, / Bead number five, / Bead number six, / Bead number seven, / And may the strength of the seven beads / Scatter your disease upon yon grey stones over there.”) Macdonald explains: “While repeating this charm, the magician counted the ‘beads’, giving a line of the charm just as each bead was passed. It must be a very old charm, and seems to have been at times used for the relief of sprained ankles and dislocated joints.” See Macdonald’s ‘Medical Spells and Charms of the Highlands. I’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 13 (1887–88), pp. 34–40: 38. William Mackenzie (‘Gaelic Incantations, Charms, and Blessings of the Hebrides’, TGSI 18 (1891–92), pp. 97–182) gives examples of this charm of the seven paternosters at pp. 141 and 158; see also [Alexander Macbain], ‘Gaelic Incantations’, The Highland Monthly, vol. 3 (1891–92), pp. 174–81, 222–31, 290–97, 341–48: 228.

10 Peter Rose here gives S’luiean ear faus s’noire, i.e. Is a luighean air fàs san uair (‘His ankle having grown at the time’). Other sources have air fàs leum bruach, which I do not understand. I think fàs leum must be for fàslom’, fàslomairt, a compound meaning an encampment or bivouac, from fas ‘a stance’, long ‘a ship’ and port ‘a harbour’, given by Dwelly as faslairt, fàs-lomairt, and discussed at length in W. J. Watson’s Celtic Place-Names of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1926), pp. 493–95. Robert Armstrong, in A Gaelic Dictionary (London, 1825), p. 242, associates the word with the practice of cooking victuals in an animal’s stomach; such an association may be the reason why the poultice brought the word to John Roy’s mind. The practice was thus described in Fr James Dalrymple’s translation of Bishop John Leslie’s De Origine, Moribus, et Rebus Scotorum of 1578:

In tyme of weir quhen to the feildes to karie pottis, panis, and vthir kitchine veshels, thay thot hauie [heavy] and molestful, in place of potis and sik seithing vesselis, the painches of ane ox or ane kow thay vset cheiflie. Gif necessitie vrge, this day thay take the hail meklewame [stomach] of ane slain ox, thay turne and dicht [prepare, dress] it, thay fill it partlie with watir partlie with flesche, thay hing it in the cruik or a sting [pole], eftir the maner of a pott, and sa thay kuik it verie commodiouslie vpon the fyre. In quhilke kynd of seithing, is another vtilitie yit fruitfuller and mair commodious: that the brue of this fleshe, the fatt remaineng stil, thay make of sik a sorte wt litle labour, bot wt gret ingine, that the best wine nor na vthir kynd of drink thay compare til it. (P. Hume Brown, Scotland before 1700 from Contemporary Documents (Edinburgh, 1893), pp. 164–65)

25 For deiseil (‘sunwise’, ‘clockwise’) Turner has seannsail (‘lucky’), from English ‘chance’. See poem 31, line 127.

[TD 452]

28 The prophecy to which John Roy refers was one which had gained scriptural status in Jacobite ideology. Its origin appears to be a fifteenth-century ballad known as ‘The Romance and Prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune’ which claimed that a bastard would come out of the west and become leader of all Britain. ‘Out of the west’ was generally understood to refer to a fleet coming from Spain to Scotland via Ireland. The ‘bastard’ issue was more problematic; though known, it was not referred to directly in propaganda. See poem 10, note on lines 1–2; notes on poem 30; and my articles ‘How did Thomas become the Messiah?’ (WHFP, 30 January 1998) and ‘A Century of Coded Messages’ (WHFP, 13 February 1998).

40 The asseveration Crom an Donais (‘Hunchback of the Devil’) takes us back to the idol Crom Cruaich (‘Hunchback of the Hill’) or Crom Dubh (‘Black Hunchback’) destroyed by St Patrick, perhaps to be equated with the god Lugh. See Máire MacNeill, The Festival of Lughnasa (Oxford, 1962), pp. 28–32, 409–17, 681; my article ‘Black Humphy of the Hill’ (WHFP, 17 April 1992); and poem 22, note on lines 107–12.

48 Turner and Irvine have ’S cuir ar naimhdean air fògradh uainn (‘And banish from us our enemies’).


34. Achadh nan Comhaichean

After c. 1600, fulling-mills or waulk-mills spread gradually north and west from the Lowlands. In Skye and the Western Isles the women’s traditional practice of milling or waulking the newly-woven cloth by hand survived to c. 1900 and later, but in Argyll and most of the Highland mainland it was eliminated during 1750–1800. Ewan MacPherson (for whom see poem 47) erected such a mill at Cluny c. 1741. Fifteen years later, in 1756, it was still ‘the only walk milln in the Breas of Badenoch or betwixt that and the western ocean’, see Alan G. Macpherson, A Day’s March to Ruin (Newtonmore, 1996), p. 3. This situation then changed so radically that by the twentieth century the coming of waulk-mills and the retreat of Gaelic were effectively synonymous, and tùcadair (‘a waulker’) entered the English language as ‘teuchter’, an insulting term for a Gaelic-speaking Highlander.

Whenever hand-waulking ceased, the creation of waulking-songs ceased, and ‘Achadh nan Comhaichean’ appears to be the type of song that took over in the second half of the eighteenth century from waulking-songs like ‘An Fhìdeag Airgid’ (poem 9). In the fashion of waulking-songs, it mixes three inter-connected themes: in this case, a poor girl’s love for a man of higher status; Prince Charles; and the traumatic aftermath of Culloden. The result of this intermingling is a sense that we are being admitted to a set of random thoughts in the mind of a traumatised young girl of the post-Culloden period.

[TD 453]

Our song is spoken of by Col. David Stewart of Garth in his Sketches of the Highlanders of Scotland, vol. 1 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1822, repr. Edinburgh, 1977), p. 109. First he refers to Stewart of Ballachulish (who had been ‘out’ in both 1715 and 1745 and who is identified by Appin tradition, I understand, as the assassin of Campbell of Glenure) as saying of his promising young son that ‘next to the happiness of seeing Charles restored to the throne of his forefathers, is the promise my son affords of being an honour to his family’. He goes on:

A song or ballad of that period, set to a melancholy and beautiful air, was exceedingly popular among the Highlanders, and sung by all classes. It is in Gaelic, and cannot be translated without injury to the spirit and effect. One verse, alluding to the conduct of the troops after the suppression of the rebellion, proceeds thus: “They ravaged and burnt my country; they murdered my father, and carried off my brothers; they ruined my kindred, and broke the heart of my mother;—but all, all could I bear without murmur, if I saw my king restored to his own.”


I take lines 1–12 and 17–28 from NLS MS 14878 (Rev. Alexander Irvine, section B), pp. 175–76. These five verses and chorus are all of the song that this manuscript contains. Irvine (1772–1824), a native of Garth in Glenlyon, was minister of Little Dunkeld from 1806 to 1824. A longer version collected by him is, or was, present in section D, pp. 105–09, described by John Mackechnie, Catalogue of Gaelic Manuscripts in Selected Libraries in Great Britain and Ireland, vol. 1 (Boston, 1973), p. 342. This is now missing, but fortunately it was copied in 1914 by the Rev. A. J. Macdonald of Killearnan into what is now NLS MS 3781, pp. 27–30. Macdonald transcribes Irvine’s heading: ‘Oran ma’s fior le Flora Macdonald ’s mòr iomradh sa Bhliadhna 1746 do Phrionnsa Tearlach ’s e air fògradh, a thuaradh o Mr. R. Macdonald, Ministeir Feairtichill 30th Augt. 1821’ (‘A song alleged to be by the Flora Macdonald so celebrated in the Year 1746 to Prince Charles upon his wanderings, which was got from Mr R. Macdonald, Minister of Fortingall 30 August 1821’). I take lines 29–56 from this manuscript. We may dismiss out of hand the attribution to Flora Macdonald, as the focus of the song is clearly the mainland districts of Rannoch and Lochaber.

Under the title ‘Oran do Phriunnsa Tearlach’, Mackenzie gives a chorus and seven verses of the song in SO 373, with the note:

The real author of this favourite ditty is not known, and though published on the ‘lips of thousand fair maidens and fond admirers’, this is the first time it has been committed to press. Various MS copies of it are in our possession, the oldest of which is by a Lady and bears the following title, ‘Miss Flora Macdonald’s Lament for Prince Charles.’


Mackenzie’s verses, and those in NLS MS 14878, contain everything in the song that relates clearly to the ’45. It appears that the song had

[TD 454]

undergone a process of editorial filleting to emphasise its Jacobite content. Only one of Mackenzie’s verses appears to be unique, and I include it in my text as lines 13–16.

1 Achadh nan Comhaichean is on the south bank of the Spean in Brae Lochaber. It appears on maps as ‘Achnacochine’. For the MacDonalds of ‘Achnancoichean’, a branch of the Keppoch family, see the Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Clan Donald, vol. 3 (Inverness, 1904), pp. 457–61. I take the name to be from cumha, comha, ‘term’, ‘condition’, plural cumhaichean, comhaichean, ‘terms’, ‘conditions’, ‘covenant’. The reading in SO is Àirigh nan Comhaichean (‘the Shieling of the Covenant’).

3–4 Glen Loy and Loch Eil are in Lochaber. Glen Doe is south of Loch Ness at Fort Augustus, while the Coireacha Bà (or Batha) are in the hills overlooking the Black Mount on the western edge of Rannoch Moor. For Gleann Dotha and Coireacha Batha, SO has Gleann’-comhan (‘Glen Coe’) and Gleann’-tadha (clearly in error for Gleann Dotha).

5–8 The refrain in SO is:

<gai>
Hillirin hò-rò ho bha hò
’S na hillirin hò-rò ho bha hì,
Na hillirin hò-rò ho bha hò,
Mo lean dubh mór on chaïdh tu dhiom.
<eng>

These are meaningless vocables, except for the fourth line which means: ‘It’s my great sorrow that you have left me.’

9–12 SO has a verse which is a mixture of these lines and lines 21–24.

27 Literally ‘they’ve stripped my mother’, a euphemism. See An Tuil, pp. 209, 746.

28 SO has ’S bu lughaid mo mhulad nan cinneadh le Teàrlach (‘And my grief would be less if things prospered with Charles’).

31 SO has Gaol nach tugainn do dhiùc no dh’iarla (‘A love I’d not give to duke nor to earl’).

33–36 SO has:

<gai>
Fhleasgaich ud am beul a’ ghlinne
Le t’ fhalt dualach sìos mu d’ shlinnean,
B’ annsa leam na ’chuach bu bhinne
Nuair dhèanadh tu rium do chòmhradh milis.
<eng>

(“O yon handsome youth in the mouth of the glen / With your locks that curl round your shoulderblade, / Sweeter to me than the cuckoo that’s sweetest / Was when you would make your sweet converse to me.”)

37 Dwelly s.v. beadagan: “Originally a tup lamb about six months old, as it was very keen at that age to cover the sheep. Lads in their teens inclined to have carnal connection with women are

[TD 455]

called beadagan in the W. Isles.” His information was from the Rev. John MacRury.

38 The poet chooses to epitomise poverty through grinding and graddaning, much as did Dòmhnall mac Fhionnlaigh nan Dàn in ‘Òran na Comhachaig’ (BGh 253): B’ annsa leam na dùrdan bodaich / Os cionn lic’ ag eararadh sìl / Bùirein an daimh … (“Dearer to me than a peasant’s mumbling / As he graddans seedcorn over a flagstone / Is the roar of the stag …”) The mumbling is of an appropriate incantation such as that collected by Alexander Carmichael, Carmina Gadelica, vol. 1 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1928), pp. 250–51. For graddaning, a notoriously wasteful method of preparing a handful of grain by burning off the ears, see Dwelly s.v. gradan and my article ‘The Fast Food of the Gael of Old’, WHFP, 26 May 1995. For the bodaich (‘peasants’) see poem 37, note on lines 121–30.

39 Beagan, ‘a small thing, trifle, mite or puckle’, is that which lies beneath the dignity of a well-born person, see p. 526, item 2.10. Here it seems to refer to an inadequate meal.

40 Leadan, a head of long hair, epitomises higher status, as does everything in the following verse. See p. 527, item 5.1.

56 More literally perhaps ‘My fair-skinned boy would be in the bosom of my shirt’. There is, I think, deliberate ambiguity as to whether the girl is referring to her imagined lover or their child. Compare the use of ‘baby’ in twentieth-century pop-songs.


35. An t-Éideadh Gàidhealach

As a consequence of the fright given by the ’45 to the Hanoverian régime, two major pieces of legislation were enacted in 1747 which revolutionised Highland life from top to bottom. Firstly, an Act anent Hereditary Jurisdictions removed the chiefs’ hold over their people in the form of their feudal entitlement to sit in courts of barony and regality in judgement upon them – the so-called ‘right of pit and gallows’ whose worst excesses are described in the notes to poem 22, lines 71–72, poem 53, line 94, and poem 56, lines 53–56. No longer was a Highland chief to exercise absolute power, no longer was he to be a rìgh or king.

Secondly, a Disarming Act was passed. It enacted, firstly, that any person in the Highlands possessing or concealing any kind of arms should be liable, in the first instance, to a severe fine, and be committed to prison without bail till payment. If the delinquent were a man, and unable to pay the fine, he was to be sent to serve as a soldier in America, or, if unfit for service, to be imprisoned for six months; if a woman, she was, besides the fine and imprisonment till payment, to be detained six months in prison. The punishment for a second offence was seven years’ transportation.

[TD 456]

There was also a section in the Disarming Act which became known as the Disclothing Act. It stated that from and after 1 August 1747 any man or boy in Scotland (except officers and soldiers in His Majesty’s service) who wore the plaid, philibeg or little kilt, trews, shoulder-belt, or any part of the Highland garb, or who used tartan or party-coloured plaid or stuff for great-coats or upper coats, should (without the alternative of a fine) on the first conviction be imprisoned for six months without bail, and on the second conviction be transported for seven years.

The Disarming Act was enforced at Fort William and other places in 1747 and 1748 by means of an oath which showed that the authorities knew exactly the customs and beliefs of the people they were trying to subdue. Those who refused to take it were treated as rebels. It survives in Gaelic also.

I, ——, do swear, and as I shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, I have not, nor shall have, in my possession any gun, sword, pistol, or arm whatsoever, and never use tartan, plaid, or any part of the Highland garb; and if I do so, may I be cursed in my undertakings, family, and property, — may I never see my wife and children, father, mother, or relations, — may I be killed in battle as a coward, and lie without Christian burial in a strange land, far from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may all this come across me if I break my oath.


Military reports and anecdotes detail the people’s efforts to evade the Disclothing Act. Tartan plaids were dyed brown, or worn under a coat until no one was looking. Tight breeches were particularly obnoxious, and as the law did not specify on which part of the body they were to be worn, some people simply carried them around, perhaps suspended over their shoulders on the long stick which they now carried in place of a gun. Others sewed up the centre of the kilt, which, as Stewart of Garth remarked, ‘gave it something of the form of the trowsers worn by Dutch skippers’. One man excused himself by saying that he wore only ‘dyed blanket’. Two men, one wearing trousers and the other a kilt, were once chased into a house; they had time to strip before their pursuers came in after them, and the soldiers could not swear afterwards as to which of them had been wearing the kilt. Others were not so lucky, and for ten years the jails were full of men wearing tartan. In Culloden (1967 edn, London), p. 313, John Prebble cites the report of a weekend’s work in 1751 by a Captain Molesworth of Guise’s Regiment.

The party at Strathglass apprehended Archibald Chisholm in Glencannick of Strathglass, wearing the phillibeg and he is, at my instance, committed to Inverness Gaol for six months. The day following a young fellow in full plaid was pursued by the said party on their patrole, and to avoid them attempted swimming a loch and was drowned.

[TD 457]

Dr Johnson described the Disarming and Disclothing acts as ‘laws, which, though they cannot be called cruel, have produced much discontent, because they operate on the surface of life, and make every eye bear witness to subjection’, see Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), p. 97.

The immediate result of such draconian legislation was to unite the Highland people more than any ‘Òran nam Fineachan’ had ever done, and to risk a second rebellion. Those who had supported the government were outraged at receiving the same treatment as those who had supported Prince Charles. I print just one song on the subject, possibly the first, but the fact that it was composed by the wife of a presbyterian minister is symptomatic. References to the breacan or tartan plaid had begun life as a very minor motif in the rhetorical code of Gaelic verse (see p. 526, item 4.7.3); before and during the ’45 Mac Mhaighstir Alastair made much of it as a symbol in his Jacobite propaganda, and he later wrote of how, on the deck of La Doutelle in Loch nan Uamh, he had instructed the newly-arrived Prince on its use (Anthony Aufrere (ed.), The Lockhart Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1817), pp. 480–81):

He asked me if I was not cold in that habite (viz. the highland garb). I answered I was so habituated to it that I should rather be so if I was to change my dress for any other. At this he laugh’d heartily and next enquired how I lay with it at night, which I explaind to him; he said that by wraping myself so closs in my plaid I would be unprepared for any sudden defence in the case of a surprise. I answered that in such times of danger or during a war we had a different method of useing the plaid, that with one spring I could start to my feet with drawn sword and cock’d pistol in my hand without being in the least incumber’d with my bedcloaths.


Now, following the Disclothing Act, there was such a torrent of Gaelic verse on the subject that a collection of it would fill a volume the size of An Lasair. The list of poets who praised the Highland dress and dispraised the Lowland one covers the entire political spectrum from Mac Mhaighstir Alastair and Lachlan MacPherson of Strathmashie through John MacCodrum and William Ross to Duncan Ban Macintyre, Rob Donn and our Margaret Campbell. With his irrepressible sense of humour, Strathmashie declared (SO 263):

<gai>
Cha chléirichean ’s chan easbaigean
Chum a bhàrr an t-Seisein mi
Ach a’ bhriogais leibideach
Nach dèanadh anns na preasan clann!
<eng>

(“It’s not ministers or bishops / That kept me off the Session / But the irritating breeches / That could make no babies in the bushes!”) The best general source for such poems is J. L. Campbell’s Highland Songs of the ’45 (2nd edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984).

[TD 458]

In 1757, a Breadalbane man called MacAlpin, or Drummond MacGregor, was acquitted after proving that his kilt had been stitched up the middle, the first indication that the courts were taking a more relaxed view. The damage had been done, however. By the time the hated law was repealed in 1782, the day-to-day clothing of the Highland people had changed forever. The process of humiliation was complete, and the kingdom was, in appearance, more united than ever before.

The above account of the so-called Disclothing Act is taken chiefly from Col. David Stewart of Garth, Sketches of the Highlanders of Scotland, vol. 1 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1822, repr. Edinburgh, 1977), pp. 115–19, but also from Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The MacDonald Collection of Gaelic Poetry (Inverness, 1911), p. lix.

Margaret Campbell was second wife of the Rev. James Stevenson, who was minister of Ardnamurchan and Islandfinnan from 1703 to 1732, and of Ardchattan and Muckairn from 1732 to 1751. They were married in 1735, three years after Stevenson ‘gladly answered a call to Ardchattan’, evading regulations against transportability by not troubling to inform his own presbytery of Mull (William Ferguson, ‘The Problems of the Established Church in the West Highlands and Islands in the Eighteenth Century’, Records of the Scottish Church History Society, vol. 17 (1972), pp. 15–31: 24). She died in 1775, surviving her husband by 24 years (Fasti). See also notes on poem 36.

I take our poem from The MacDonald Collection, pp. 348–49. There are also versions in EUL Carmichael-Watson MS 135, GUL MacLagan MS 165, NLS MS 3781, pp. 23–26, and NLS MSS 14877–81 (Rev. Alexander Irvine), section B, pp. 175–76, and section D, pp. 105–09. This last is missing, but the Rev. John Mackechnie, in his Catalogue of Gaelic Manuscripts in Selected Libraries in Great Britain and Ireland, vol. 1 (Boston, 1973), p. 328, says that it is (or was) headed ‘Le Nic Mhaistir Cailin, Mrs Stevenson, 1746’ – ‘By Mr Colin’s daughter, Mrs Stevenson, 1746’. ‘Mr Colin’ is the celebrated mathematician Colin Campbell of Achnaba (1644–1726), who was minister of Ardchattan and Muckairn from 1667 to 1726. The Fasti do not mention that he had any daughters, but he married twice and had four sons, so the statement that our poet was a daughter of her husband’s celebrated predecessor in Ardchattan is plausible.

25–28 The picture is comical and is meant to be so. Highland ponies (then as now) were small, shaggy, and not conducive to equestrian dignity.

33–36 The contrast is between the raucous commercial fairs of the burghs and the traditional hospitality of the chief sitting in state as a rìgh in his medieval-style court.

63–64 The poet appeals to public opinion to press for a change in the law.

36. Acarsaid nan Con ’s nan Gillean

For the poet see poems 24, 30 and 39. It is not clear to whom this item is addressed. At least two satires, and possibly this one also, were aimed by Mac Mhaighstir Alastair at a minister’s wife who appears to have satirised Prince Charles just as Mrs Campbell of Barr had done (poem 30). This minister’s wife may have been a daughter of the Rev. Colin Campbell of Ardchattan, in which case she is surely none other than the author of poem 35.

If our poem is indeed addressed to Mrs Stevenson, its real target was a man the poet knew well. As presbyterian minister of Ardnamurchan and Islandfinnan from 1703 to 1732, the Rev. James Stevenson had been in the front line of the struggle against ‘popery and superstition’, and William Ferguson pays him the ultimate accolade. Referring to the evangelicalism for which the Highlands are now so noted, he concludes (‘The Problems of the Established Church in the West Highlands and Islands in the Eighteenth Century’, Records of the Scottish Church History Society, vol. 17 (1972), pp. 15–31: 31):

It was the labours of parish ministers like James Stevenson, Aeneas Sage, Alexander Pope and many others, who had devoted their lives to the difficult task of planting the kirk in the face of hardship and actual danger, that had made Highland presbyterian fervour possible.


The poet’s own father, Mgr Alastair, had served as minister of Islandfinnan and Ardnamurchan from c. 1685 until his death in 1724, even though he had refused to conform to presbyterianism following the revolution of 1688, and was formally deposed in 1697. He is remembered in the area to this day for his heroic journeys to preach in Ardnamurchan. Shortly after his death, Alastair himself became a schoolmaster and catechist in the parish. His initial struggles – no doubt including the Morag episode, for which see poem 24, as well as a desperate petition of 1730 to have himself moved from Moidart to Ardnamurchan – took place during Stevenson’s ministry. Although Stevenson recommended him warmly, his petition did not bear fruit until the minister had moved to Ardchattan, see my Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: The Ardnamurchan Years (Coll, 1986), pp. 3–5, 20–21. It may be speculated, then, that in so far as satires such as ‘Òran nam Bodach’ were in the interests of social control, they had the tacit support or active encouragement of James Stevenson (see pp. xxxv–xxxix).

‘Mìomholadh Mòraig’, which is a literary masterpiece but does Alastair no moral credit whatsoever, may thus have been composed at Stevenson’s insistence. We may never know whether relations between these two men in 1724–32 were tense or cordial, but we have to suspect that Alastair was conscious of injustices done by Stevenson to his father and to himself. Was Morag revenged upon Margaret Campbell?

I take the poem from a manuscript in the poet’s own hand, NLS Adv. MS 72.2.13, pp. 145–46. A transcript was published by John Lorne

[TD 460]

Campbell in ‘Gaelic MS. 63 of the National Library’, Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 4 (1934–35), pp. 70–84, 153–204: 83–84.

2 I take cullainn here to be a variant of collainn, which appears in the sense of ‘bonking, having sex’ in ‘Mìomholadh Mòraig’, see poem 22, note on lines 107–12, and Alastair Mac-Dhonuill, Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich (Edinburgh, 1751), p. 35. Dwelly gives collainn as meaning ‘a smart stroke’.

3 Alastair now launches into a play on words. Callainn, Collainn, Cullainn, Callaig, Collaig, Cullaig are all variants of a term for New Year derived from ‘kalend’. Traditionally on oidhche Challainn (Hogmanay) a party of boys would go from house to house performing the scapegoat ritual prescribed in Leviticus 16: 10, 21. The leader would put on a dried animal skin – of a bull or cow, or down to the eighteenth century a goat, more recently a sheep – and dance round the house while the others beat at the skin and the walls with sticks and clubs, chanting: A Challainn a’ bhuilg bhuidhe bhoicinn, buailibh an craiceann – a’ Challainn seo! (“O Hogmanay of the yellow buckskin bag, beat the skin – this Hogmanay!”) Then they would recite a rhyme at the door and be allowed in one by one in order to receive the hospitality of the house and to perform the dewlap ritual described in poem 4, note on line 8. See notes on poem 55; Norman Macleod, Reminiscences of a Highland Parish (5th edn, London, 1882), p. 342; TGSI 12 (1885–86), p. 100; and Alexander Carmichael, Carmina Gadelica, vol. 2 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1928), pp. 148–49.

19–20 I do not think coltolis is for cultoris. Cultoris memento mori would mean ‘in remembrance of a farmer’s death’, which makes no sense to me. Since line 20 clearly refers to male impotence (cf. poem 5, line 32), my best guess is that line 19 refers to female impotence, that coltolis is for clitoris, and that it is the use of this half-remembered anatomical term that provokes the Latin phrase. The Oxford English Dictionary cites two instances of ‘clitoris’ from the seventeenth century, none from the eighteenth. Perhaps, then, we may interpret these lines thus: “To warn of the death of the clitoris / Comes a head with no meat and no soup in it.”


37. An Taisbean

John Mackenzie has this to say about the poet (SO 159):

Eachunn Mac-Leoid, or Hector McLeod, the South Uist bard, lived after the year 1745, on the main land, chiefly in the districts of Arisaig and Morar. He composed and sung [sic] as he was moved by those

[TD 461]

internal powers of which the generality of men appear but little sensible. There are some individuals that appear heavy and destitute of parts, who are possessed of powers which attract the attention and merit the esteem of those who are more intimately acquainted with them: our poet was one of these.

What occasioned his removal from the Long Island we know not. It is not unlikely that he was sent hither to watch and give information of what was going on in those troublesome times. He went often to Fort-William, as if doing something of no consequence, while in reality he was hearing all the news of the day, which he related to friends who durst not appear themselves.

Shrewd and intelligent, he concealed those talents from strangers, to whom he seemed fooling, which character he could assume as occasion required. As he was frequently going and returning the same way, he was suspected and brought as a spy before the Governor of the Fort: on being examined and interrogated, he acquitted himself so well, under the assumed character, that he was dismissed as a fool.


Nevertheless he remains the ‘mystery man’ of eighteenth-century Gaelic verse. Following the Gillies and MacDonald collections, Mackenzie says that he was from South Uist, but his surname was (and is) unusual there. There is no trace of that island in his work. All the place- and personal names in it appear to derive from Arisaig and Morar.

Like Mac Mhaighstir Alastair, MacLeod is very fond of rhyming on short syllables, even when praising nature. He employs less rhyme than any other eighteenth-century poet. Indeed none of his four extant poems employ regular aicill at all, which is extraordinary. Some verses in his ‘Moladh do Choileach Smeòraich’ (‘The Praise of a Cock-Thrush’, Stewart 294–96, SO 159–60) do not even appear to scan. We may perhaps see it as a realistic imitation of bird-song, but there seems to be more in that poem than simple delight in the song of the cock-thrush, and one feels driven to the conclusion that the cock-thrush is a literary reference to Mac Mhaighstir Alastair in his ‘Smeòrach Chlann Raghnaill’ and/or to John MacCodrum in his ‘Smeòrach Chlann Dòmhnaill’.

In ‘Moladh Eas Mòrair’ (‘The Praise of the Falls of Morar’, SO 160) there are long syllables. This comes as a relief. The subject-matter is familiar at first: a waterfall; birdsong; Coille Chros. Then we move on to people and animals: cowherd, dairymaid. The cows are named. So are the girls. And some places – Innis Mhullaich an Tùir, Bad nan Clach Glas, Acha Uladail. The inevitable comparison is with Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s ‘Fàilte na Mòrair’ (‘The Salute to Morar’, SO 125–26). The fertility of the land is emphasised. Finally the poet descends the hill to the shore, sees ships, comes to the township, and receives a glass of whisky from a Mary MacColl. I can read nothing political into it; but I can read respect for Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair into it.

‘Moladh Choille Chros’ (‘The Praise of Cross Wood’, SO 161), which Watson admired enough to put into BGh, is another strange piece. Like much of ‘Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill’ (poem 39) it is in

[TD 462]

snéadhbhairdne (sometimes poor snéadhbhairdne). This in itself warns us of the possibility that, if not actually satirical, the poet’s intention may at least be ambivalent. Every end-word in it, and therefore every word which could possibly be relevant to rhyme, is a short monosyllable – normally the antithesis of beauty. There is no particular excuse in bird-song for this, although the bird-song and waterfall come into it (in fact ‘Moladh Eas Mòrair’ and ‘Moladh Choille Chros’ are printed as a single poem in the Gillies collection). If there is a message it is: “Come to Cross Wood.” Is it some kind of signal?

The answer appears to lie in a journal of Prince Charles’s wanderings given to Bishop Robert Forbes, at the very end of a section in Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s handwriting (The Lyon in Mourning, vol. 1 (ed. Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1895), p. 332):

The old Laird [of MacKinnon] and four of his men … ferryed his royal highness over from Skie to a place called Buarblach in Glengary’s lands. He was but two or three nights upon the MacKinnon’s lands. Here it is to be observed, though he happened to be landed upon Glengarie’s lands, that he would by no means go to Knoydart, which was very near to him, nor to Lochabar, but chused to strike directly to Clanranald’s continent to a place called Cross in Morror, from whence he was received and conveyed by Angus MacDonald of Boradale, the first house he entred in the Highlands at his first landing upon the continent. Veir mi niosh a chorrahimain yuit fein, gos a faidh mi tuillad Gaoisid. i.e. I leave you the Thrawcrook till I get more hair.


Finally (SO 161–62) we have our own poem. It is mainly in the same metre as ‘Moladh Eas Mòrair’, with long syllables, and though its visionary function is made explicit at the start (lines 1–4), we have to get through some stanzas of natural description (lines 5–28) before meeting Prince Charles (lines 29–38). This suggests familiarity with the Irish aisling poetry of the period. The vision summoned by the Prince, however (lines 39–78), is more reminiscent of the popular prophetic literature of contemporary chapbooks in English, with its emphasis on heraldry and animal symbolism. Then (lines 79–104) we meet an imitation of the Harlaw ‘Brosnachadh’ (‘Incitement’), an extraordinary medieval poem by Lachlann MacMhuirich consisting almost entirely of a string of seventy heroic epithets arranged in alphabetical order, mainly four per letter, from A to U, for which see Derick S. Thomson, ‘The Harlaw Brosnachadh: An Early Fifteenth-Century Literary Curio’, in Celtic Studies: Essays in Memory of Angus Matheson (ed. James Carney and David Greene, London, 1968), pp. 147–69.

Following four more verses of heraldry and animal symbolism (lines 105–20), including an evocation of ‘Smeòrach Chlann Raghnaill’ (lines 109–12, see below), the poem – or rather performance – takes another strange twist in the form of a passage of prose (lines 121–30). As frequently happens in the crosanachd tradition (for which see pp. xxx, 408), this appears to introduce us to some low-life characters, although,

[TD 463]

as shown below, these characters may in fact be satirical representations of officers who had fallen below the high standards of behaviour expected of Prince Charles’s army. Finally the vision is summed up in two verses foreseeing Arcadian bliss and another Jacobite rising.

All in all, the shadow of Mac Mhaighstir Alastair lies heavily over this interesting poem – MacLeod mingles pastoral verse with a variety of traditional modes to create something of contemporary relevance out of the old. It is almost an epitome of the greater poet’s work, but the way in which MacLeod sets about his task is nothing short of manic.

I take the poem from SO 161–62. There is a version of it in John Gillies, The History of the Feuds and Conflicts among the Clans … to which is added a Collection of Curious Songs in the Gallic Language (Perth, 1780), pp. 115–20, headed ‘Dain le Eichin Macleod ann Uthist Chinn a Deas’ (‘A poem by Hector MacLeod in South Uist’). This book, if we may judge from a reference to it in John Leyden’s Journal of a Tour in the Highlands and Western Islands of Scotland in 1800 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 107, was edited for Gillies by a certain Hugh MacPherson from manuscripts in the possession of a brother of the Rev. Donald MacNicol of Lismore. Gillies provides a number of interesting readings and one verse not in other sources (our lines 13–16). He ends with the prose section, having taken in the penultimate verse between our lines 12 and 13 and the final verse between our lines 56 and 57; he omits our lines 99–100; and most importantly, as shown in the note on lines 121–30 below, the prose is presented differently. The poem was also published in the Stewart collection of 1804, pp. 287–93 (Mackenzie’s source for SO), and in Ronald MacDonald’s collection of 1821, pp. 152–57. MacDonald omits our lines 85–88. There are also versions in NLS MacNicol MS 15 (missing) and GUL MacLagan MS 139.

19 Ronald MacDonald here gives (his spelling) dhe ’n uisge Chluaith (‘of the river Clyde’), cf. note on line 77 – an interesting reading though syntactically suspect, since we would have expected de dh’uisge Chluaidh. I would like it to be authentic, as it gives dramatic purpose to these tedious verses of natural description.

24 The white and red roses make one wonder if this is the battlefield of Culloden.

60 The Duke of Gordon. Gillies’s reading of this line in Feuds is Nach cluinn thu Diùc na h-Àirde Tuath? (‘Don’t you hear the Duke of the North?’).

71–75 The arms on the shield of Donald (son of John of Moidart), 1672–77, show an oared galley and a ‘salmon naiant argent’, see J. H. Stevenson, Heraldry in Scotland, vol. 2 (Glasgow, 1914), p. 420. The seals of an earlier John of Moidart (1572) and of Allan, his son and successor (1584–93), show the red hand, a tree and a ship (Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Clan Donald, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1900), pp. 226, 289). The eagle

[TD 464]

appears in the armorial bearings of the kings of the Isles, as do all of the above except the salmon, see The Clan Donald, vol. 1 (Inverness, 1896), pp. 548–49. Heather is the badge of the MacDonalds, and the red lion is presumably that of the Scottish kings. The only emblem mentioned here by the poet which I cannot account for is the castle. See also poem 11, line 39.

77 Why the poet chooses Fife I have no idea. The last great battle of the Gael was prophesied to be on the Clyde, see notes on poem 10, lines 1–2, and on line 19 above. Perhaps the poet is indulging in a little prophecy of his own.

81, 104 The Harlaw ‘Brosnachadh’ begins: A Chlanna Cuinn, cuimhnichibh / Cruas an àm na h-iorghaile (‘O Children of Conn, remember / Hardihood in time of battle’). Immediately following the alphabetical series of epithets it has the line Do chosnadh na cath-làthrach (‘In winning the battle’), here imitated by MacLeod (Thomson, ‘The Harlaw Brosnachadh’, pp. 151–52, 160–61). In between, as Thomson points out (p. 168), MacLeod borrows several epithets from the ‘Brosnachadh’.

103 The words thoirt iubhair mean literally ‘to give yew’, referring of course to archery. In Feuds Gillies modernises iubhair to fudir, i.e. fùdair (‘powder’).

109–12 This stanza refers to the MacDonalds of Clanranald and contains clear echoes of Mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s ‘Smeòrach Chlann Raghnaill’, in which the eponymous thrush declares:

<gai>
Sa Chreig Ghuirm a thogadh mise
An sgìr’ Chaisteil Bhuirgh nan cliar —
Tìr tha daonnan a’ cur thairis
Le tuil bhainne, mheala ’s fhìon’.

Sliochd nan eun bhon Chaisteal Thioram
’S bho Eilean Fhìonain nan gallan,
Moch is feasgar togar m’ iolach,
Seinn gu bileach, milis, mealach.
<eng>

(“I was raised in the Creag Ghorm / Near Borve Castle of the poet-bands — / A land that’s always overflowing / With floods of honey, milk and wine. / The scion of birds from Castle Tirrim / And Islandfinnan of the saplings, / At dawn and dusk my cry is raised, / Singing smooth-beaked, sweet, and honeyed.”) See my Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: The Ardnamurchan Years (Coll, 1986), pp. 4–5. Iain Mùideartach òg at line 110 must be the John of Moydart who was chief of Clanranald from 1618 to 1670.

113–16 This verse refers to the MacDonalds of Sleat.

117–18 These lines refer to the MacDonalds of Glengarry.

121–30 This is one of the clearest representations in Gaelic verse of the caste system of Gaelic society. First come well-born men who

[TD 465]

are officers, then bodaich or serfs who do not bear arms, cf. poem 34, note on line 38. The bodaich are not dignified with patronymics or surnames but are given epithets and places of origin. Our best description of this peasant caste comes from an anonymous ‘Description of the Isles of Scotland’ written during 1577–82 and published by W. F. Skene in Celtic Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 439–40.

In raising or furthbringing of thair men ony time of zeir to quhatsumevir cuntrie or weiris, na labourers of the ground are permittit to steir furth of the cuntrie quhatevir thair maister have ado, except only gentlemen quhilk labouris not, that the labour belonging to the teiling of the ground and wynning of thair corns may not be left undone, albeit thai byde furth ane haill zeir, as ofttimes it happins quhen ony of thair particular Ilands hes to do with Irland or neighbours, that the haill cuntriemen bides furth watching thair enemies ane zeir, half ane zeir, or thairby, as thai please. Not the les the ground is not the war labourit, nor the occupiers thairof are nather molestit, requirit, troublit, nor permittit to gang furth of thair awin cuntrie and Ile quhair thay dwell (quoted in P. Hume Brown, Scotland before 1700 from Contemporary Documents (Edinburgh, 1893), p. 272, with comment at p. 237).


It has been pointed out that a conscious social distinction existed between cattle-owners and goat-keepers – the ‘subject’ population (B. R. S. Megaw, ‘Goat-Keeping in the Old Highland Economy’, Scottish Studies, vol. 7 (1963), pp. 201–08: 207). In calculating the population of Raasay, Dr Johnson pointed inadvertently to the likelihood of there being a subject population:

Not many years ago, the late laird led out one hundred men upon a military expedition. The sixth part of a people is supposed capable of bearing arms: Raasay had therefore six hundred inhabitants. But because it is not likely, that every man able to serve in the field would follow the summons, or that the chief would leave his lands totally defenceless, or take away all the hands qualified for labour, let it be supposed, that half as many might be permitted to stay at home. The whole number will then be nine hundred, or nine to a square mile. (Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), p. 78)


Dr John MacInnes has pointed out (‘Gaelic Poetry and Historical Tradition’, in Loraine Maclean (ed.), The Middle Ages in the Highlands (Inverness, 1981), pp. 142–63: 157) that there is a persistent myth that what is popularly called ‘clan society’ was some sort of primitive democracy without distinctions of social class. “In reality,” he says, “there was a

[TD 466]

high degree of economic stratification: the popular conception would at most apply only to the upper stratum. Gaelic poetry, however, does not reflect this as sharply as we might expect, especially when we remember how strictly the main classes were divided in the Isles at least as late as the last quarter of the sixteenth century.” It is indeed extraordinarily difficult to find the bodaich in Gaelic verse. In ‘The Panegyric Code in Gaelic Poetry and its Historical Background’, TGSI 50 (1976–78), pp. 435–98: 453, MacInnes cites a couplet:

<gai>
Bhith fo bhinn aig na bodaich
Dh’am bu chosnadh cas chrom.
<eng>

At face value this means ‘Being condemned by the peasants / Whose living was the foot-plough’ – a cas chrom or ‘crooked foot’ being the implement used traditionally in the Highlands to till soils too thin, steep, soft or stony to receive a horse-drawn plough, see I. F. Grant, Highland Folk Ways (London, 1961), pp. 103–05. In context, however, it is a pun. As Ó Baoill and Bateman have demonstrated in Gàir nan Clàrsach (Edinburgh, 1994), pp. 179 and 232, the bodaich are here the barber-surgeons or chirurgeon-apothecaries of Edinburgh whom the poet (Archibald MacDonald, An Ciaran Mabach) had gone to consult c. 1684–87 about his own cas chrom or ‘gammy leg’, see Henry Grey Graham, The Social Life of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century (2nd edn, London, 1906), pp. 473–76. The version of the couplet used by Ó Baoill and Bateman is in any case S oil leam … / A bhith triall chun nam bodach / Dh’am bu chosnadh cas chrom, which may thus be translated: “I loathe … / Travelling to the low-born men / Whose living was a crooked leg.”

In the words of B. R. S. Megaw (‘Goat-Keeping in the Old Highland Economy – 2’, Scottish Studies, vol. 8 (1964), pp. 213–18: 216), “Inadequately documented and unattractive though this servile class may seem, it should by no means be ignored in any assessment of the old Highland society.”

In his Feuds, pp. 119–20, Gillies presents the prose differently. Here it is in his own spelling:

<gai>
San an shin a thaogh iad Offigich an-diaghidh, An-trocarich, an-aobhidh, an-athach, an-iochdar, Eghain aonghas a bhara a ’h Eigineig, Calum Crosta a Gruilin, Eothin Iorgalta a Cragabhaig, Dughal Ballach a Gollabaidh, Nial Eangara a Raimisigearraidh ’s Dobhnil Dugharra a Gearros. Agus thaogh iad Cuideachda Bhrothach, Bhoddach dhana Hoissigich shin gam bairm chosnidh ’s chatha Spaiddin ’s Sluasaidain gu tilichde na Mairibh ’s glannigh na Harraich.
<eng>

(“That was when they chose officers who were ungodly, unmerciful, unamiable, unfearing and unfeeling, namely Ill-

[TD 467]

Tempered Angus from Eigineig, Cross-Grained Calum from Gruilin, Obstinate Ewen from Cragabhaig, Spotted Dugald from Gollabaidh, Short-Tempered Neil from Raimisigearraidh and Dour Donald from Gearros. And they chose a mangy company of serfs from those officers whose defensive and offensive weapons would be spades and shovels to bury the dead and to cleanse the battlefield.”)


As before, the introductory series of epithets is similar in tone – and in two cases, anathach and an-tròcaireach, identical in form – to those of the ‘Brosnachadh’ (lines 85–92). But here they seem to be used pejoratively, and to result in the punishment of the officers concerned by being chosen for grave-digging duties and likened to serfs. It may well be, then, that this is how we are to understand our own version also.

The place-names all appear to be in MacDonald lands. Éigneag is in Moidart, Grùlainn is in Eigg, Gearas is in Trotternish, and Crasabhaig may represent Crossabaig in Sleat. SO gives Cràsabhaig, but Crasabhaig is the reading in Mackenzie’s source, the Stewart collection of 1804. Gallabaidh will be for Gellovie in Keppoch (see The Clan Donald 3, p. 450), and Raimisgearraidh is probably for Truimisgearraidh in N. Uist.


38. Figheadóir Mise

This poem or fragment may safely be regarded as the last breath of the medieval tradition of Gaelic verse in Ireland and Scotland. It was scrawled in Gaelic script at the top of an otherwise blank page (p. 2) of a double sheet of foolscap dated 1749 (GD.201/1/362/5) which survives among miscellaneous inventories from the Clanranald Papers (GD.201) in the National Archives of Scotland, Edinburgh. The hand is one which also appears, dated 1727, in the ‘Little Book of Clanranald’ (Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, MCR 39), pp. 199–212, 240–65 and 280. In describing the present item in ‘The Gaelic Manuscripts of Scotland’, Gaelic and Scotland: Alba agus a’ Ghàidhlig (ed. William Gillies, Edinburgh, 1989), pp. 146–74: 156 (no. 82), 169 (n. 23), I suggested tentatively that the hand may be that of Lachlann, son of Niall MacMhuirich (1636x39–1726, see poem 12). Lachlann was born c. 1672 (presumably in South Uist), so if my suggestion were to be correct, he was about 55 when he wrote in the ‘Little Book’ and about 77 when he jotted down the present item. See poem 18.

The other three pages of GD.201/1/362/5 are written in a non-Gaelic hand which is (I think) that of Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair (for whom see poems 24, 30, 36 and 39), cf. the illustrations between pp. 419 and 420 of TGSI 59 (1994–96). These three pages list 52 men in townships in Arisaig (spelt Sandagg, Guidall, Druimdarach, Kenloidd, Kappich, Aird no Fourran, Druim Choylich, Aird Gairy and Torbay)

[TD 468]

from whom depositions had been taken, seemingly regarding losses suffered after the ’45. One of the names (at Torbay) is the intriguing ‘Alexr mc Nile. the prophet’. Much more interesting for present purposes however is ‘Lauchl[an] mc Niele’ at Kappich (Keppoch, the principal settlement), from whom, unusually, no deposition was taken. This may be our poet. The presence of Lachlann MacMhuirich in Arisaig could easily be explained by the fact that his father’s long-held tack of Stilligarry and Drimisdale in South Uist had passed to his elder brother Domhnall, see William Matheson (ed.), The Songs of John MacCodrum (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1938), p. 304. Perhaps Donald MacDonald of Benbecula had brought Lachlann with him to live on the mainland when he succeded to the Clanranald chiefship in 1725.

Alastair (if he indeed it was) was particularly interested in the smuggling trade. Typical of the notes following some of the names are ‘a third of a brandy Cask’, ‘lost 2 hiden cask’, ‘one Brandy Cask’, ‘one half Cask twixt him & John Baine’, ‘had one Brandy Cask Stollen from him’, ‘1 Brandy Cask 3 g[allon]s without Locks’, ‘1 Ditto. 2 Guns, on[e] brandy Cask Ditto had 5 Casks more bought & Sold’, ‘Dep[ones] that Clan Ean vic Duile had 2 brandy casks’, ‘Dep[ones] himself half a cask has some bullets’, and ‘Dep[ones] he sold one Cask his brother sold 2 Casks to father also & sold ane other at home, and mc Coile vic Ean vic Gilchrist had a Cask’. At the foot of p. 1, however, there is also a set of accounts: for quantities of carrot, parsnip, turnip and onion seed, totalling 4s 7d; for a tartan snuff-box, two penknives and four pen cases, 2s 2d; for three cuttoes (large knives, couteaux), a yard and a half of black ribbon, and three yards of broad ribbon ‘for stock[ing]s to Gordon & William’, 6s 0d; and finally two cases of knives, 1s 4d. These accounts are totalled to 14s 1d and dated 27 March 1749.

There are two other dates. The Kenloidd depositions were taken on 25 January 1748 and those at Druim Choylich on 1 February (year not given). By the English calendar of the period this would mean 1749. Taken together with the date of the accounts, it is reasonable to conclude that the entire document, including the poem, was written in Arisaig during the first three months of 1749. It should be noted that Alastair was in Edinburgh and Leith during the period 28 December 1747 to 9 January 1748, and is referred to by Bishop Robert Forbes at that time as ‘Captain MacDonald’. It thus seems likely that in our document we see him beginning his work as a factor on the Clanranald estate, trying to assess and repair the damage done by the enemies of his kindred, while still willing to take time off to pursue his literary interests. He told Bishop Forbes at Leith on 29 December 1747 that ‘all the Campbells, from the head to the foot of them, had discovered a most avaricious, greedy temper in the matter of pillaging and plundering their native country’ (The Lyon in Mourning, vol. 1 (ed. Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1895), pp. 353–54); he had described and satirised these depredations at length in Gaelic verse, see Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Poems of Alexander MacDonald

[TD 469]

(Inverness, 1924), pp. 338–55. In 1751, when his Ais-Eiridh was published in Edinburgh, he described himself on the title-page as Bailli Chana – ‘factor of Canna’.

Even if I am right in guessing that Lachlann son of Niall MacMhuirich was the writer of the poem, it still does not mean that he was the author of it; but he might have been. It is very badly spelt: feighidar misi theanna dealbin no daun dhlué glealla / om oid gríen do duall doim / gac dainn do dheilb do fhighinnn / na missar mi e as moigi do mhelluin fer fesoig / croigh gon gháos nam bhruinne / sinno no maose mfolam. The words do duall doim represent a correction from what appears to have been bo duall doibh. The metre is deibhidhe, and I have restored the text towards the norms of classical Gaelic as best I can.

With regard to the metaphor of poet as weaver, I can do no better than cite an anecdote which brings together the Rev. Lachlan MacKenzie of Lochcarron (for whom see pp. xxxvi–xxxix) and Alastair Buidhe MacÌomhair (for whom see p. 502). Once when visited by Alastair Buidhe, Mgr Lachlann asked him to compose a poem on the Resurrection. “No,” replies Alastair, “you know more about such matters yourself, and should try your own hand at it.”

Hud a dhuine, says Mgr Lachlann, chan fhaod gun tig eadar càirdean mar sin. Nì mise ’n deilbh ’s dèan thusa ’n fhighidh. (“Hut man, friends must not fall out like that. I’ll do the warping and you do the weaving.”) The poem was composed by the poet and approved by the prophet (‘Queries and Answers’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 1 (1875–76), p. 162).

39. from Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill

For Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair see notes on poems 24, 30 and 36. During the years 1727–45, while employed as a schoolteacher and catechist at various locations in the parish of Ardnamurchan, he was increasingly drawn into the Jacobite movement. In May 1745 he left his school for the last time, and two months later he was among the Clanranald gentry who greeted Prince Charles on the deck of La Doutelle in Loch nan Uamh, see notes on poem 35. He went through the ’45 as a captain in the Clanranald regiment. His intimate connection with the rising is documented for us in (1) his Gaelic verse, as found especially in J. L. Campbell (ed.), Highland Songs of the ’45 (Edinburgh, 1933; new edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 33–163; (2) his factual documentation of the rising and its aftermath in English prose, i.e. the ‘Journall and Memoirs of P. . . . C . . . . Expedition into Scotland’ and the ‘Account of the Young Pretender’s Escape’ (Anthony Aufrere (ed.), The Lockhart Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1817), pp. 479–510, 539–62), along with a second version of the account of the Prince’s escape and some other information (Robert Forbes, The Lyon in Mourning, vol. 1

[TD 470]

(ed. Henry Paton, Scottish History Society, Edinburgh, 1895), pp. 320–54); and (3) Alexis; or, the Young Adventurer. A Novel. London, Printed for T Cooper. MDCCXLVI, a popularised account of the Prince’s escape of which he is almost certainly the author.

By 1751 Alastair was factor of Clanranald’s island of Canna (see notes on poem 38). In that year – when talk of another rising was in the air – thirty-one of his poems were published in Edinburgh under the revealing title Ais-Eiridh na Sean Chánoin Albannaich (‘The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Tongue’). Many of these poems were seditious, and it is believed that, for this reason, copies of the book were burned by the common hangman at the mercat cross of Edinburgh. On the other hand, some of the poems were obscene, and it may be that the belief that the book was burned results from wishful thinking by later commentators like the Rev. Dr Mackintosh MacKay, a moderator of the general assembly of the Free Church, who wrote of the Ais-Eiridh that ‘as its most deserved fate, we should like to see it burned by the hand of the common executioner’, see his Songs and Poems, in the Gaelic Language, by Robert Mackay (Inverness, 1829), p. xlvi.

‘Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill’ is not in the Ais-Eiridh, and all that can be said for certain is that the poet put it together during the years between 1751 and his death c. 1770. The tradition in Canna is that he composed it there while lying under an upturned boat in a place called Lag nam Boitean (‘the Hollow of the Sheaves’). One story has it that a centipede fell off a thwart into a puddle and that the struggling of its legs as it lay upside-down in the water reminded him of a sixteen-oared galley. Since the poem is a people’s epic ‘reconstructed’ from earlier sources according to the then fashionable principles laid down by scholars such as Thomas Blackwell, who published An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer in 1735, the issue is whether Alastair or James Macpherson (for whom see poem 59) was the first in Highland literature to create such an epic. The balance of evidence suggests that Alastair was first, perhaps by as much as a decade; if this is so, it is certain that Macpherson would have been aware of the fact, and that he was influenced by the older man’s achievement. The methodology was identical: collect, copy, collate, concoct, stitch, sew. It is no coincidence that in the Eigg collection of 1776 (p. 323) the tacksman of Ardnabie compares Alastair to the inspiration of all epic poets:

<gai>
Gun tug thu bàrr air Hòmar
Ge b’e ceòl-fhear mòr sa Ghreugais e.
<eng>

(“You have surpassed even Homer / Great musician though he was in Greek.”)

The poem is called in Uist Clanranald’s ‘Sgiobaireachd’ (‘Navigation’), a word that evokes both the great voyages of the Celtic past like the ‘Navigatio Sancti Brendani’ and the crucial role of the sgioba (‘crew’). It describes in a little over 600 lines how Clanranald’s galley is blessed and rowed to a sailing place; how the crew are then

[TD 471]

deployed; how she sets sail from Loch Eynort in South Uist on St Brigid’s Day, and survives a great storm to arrive safely at Carrickfergus in Antrim. The poet uses his awesome word-power to describe the ship, its crew, and the forces of nature.

Most of the ‘Birlinn’ is in snéadhbhairdne, the metre traditionally mixed with highly satirical prose passages to form the crosanachd mode, see poem 21. There are prose passages here and there in the ‘Birlinn’, our lines 217–21 being the longest, but they are not satirical. The poem’s ‘raw materials’ include a traditional ship’s blessing, the Ossianic tale ‘Cath Fionntràgha’ (‘The Battle of Ventry’), a version of which exists in Alastair’s hand (NLS Adv. MS 72.2.11), and ‘An Duanag Ullamh’ (‘The Pre-Prepared Ditty’), a poem in praise of a sixteenth-century Earl of Argyll. This last is of particular interest, because it exists in the hand of Alastair’s friend and admirer the Kintyreman William MacMurchy, it is in snéadhbhairdne, and it has breaks in sense which suggest the loss of prose passages containing satire on Argyll’s enemies. Is it possible that the ‘Birlinn’ is a satire? And if so, on whom?

To answer this we must place it in the context of the Gaelic ship-poetry of the previous couple of centuries. This is of two kinds: a lyrical variety in which the hero tends to be portrayed, as MacInnes has pointed out (TGSI 50, p. 453), ‘as a warrior in charge of a ship rather than as a seaman himself’ (see poem 13, lines 38–42), and an allegorical type, the ‘ship of state’, in which the ship is a metaphor for the clan, steered by the chief with the aid of the Holy Trinity (see poem 13, lines 49–60). Against this background what stands out about the ‘Birlinn’ is the importance given to the members of the crew. This was foreshadowed by Murdoch Matheson’s ‘Òran don Iarla Thuathach, Triath Chlann Choinnich’ (‘A Song to the Northern Earl, the Chief of the MacKenzies’), a poem of tremendous verve about Seaforth’s voyage to Lewis in 1719; it includes the following (SO 76):

<gai>
Gur gaoth a-deas a dh’éighinn dhut
Gun chruas gun tais’ a shéideadh rith’,
Fear beairte beachdail geurchuiseach
Gu sunndach, bras, neo-éisleanach
Bhith fuasgladh pailteas eudaich dhi
Ga bhréideadh air gach bòrd.
<eng>

(“I’d call up a south wind for you / To blow not hard or damp on her, / An attentive subtle rigger / Who’s cheerful, lively, and unflagging / As he gives her ample sailcloth / And spreads it on each tack.”)

<gai>
Gun innsinn gnìomh do stiùradair:
Fear cuimhneach ciallach cùramach
Dh’aithnicheadh fiamh a’ chùlanaich,
A chuireadh srian ri cùrsaireachd
Mum bristeadh trian a chùirnean oirr’ —
A mhùchadh e fo sròin.
<eng>

[TD 472]

(“I’d relate your helmsman’s duty: / A mindful, wise and cautious man / Who’d recognise the back wave’s hue, / Who’d rein her progress in before / A third of its drops had sprayed her — / Which he’d quench under her bow.”)

<gai>
T’ fhear eòlais làidir fradharcach,
Deas-labhrach, gàireach, gleadharach,
Mìn-chinnteach, seòlta, foidhidneach,
Crann-gèadha ’nad làimh adhartaich,
Mac-samhail rasg mhic-fraoire —
Siud mar thaghainn dhut na seòid!
<eng>

(“Your strong keen-sighted lookout, / Articulate, loud-voiced, talkative, / Dead certain, cunning, patient, / A boat-hook in your stretching hand, / Eye as good as any gannet’s — / That’s how I’d choose your heroes!”)

Hugh MacDiarmid published a translation of the ‘Birlinn’ in 1935 with Sorley MacLean’s help. It is, I believe, the poem’s stress on the dignity of labour that drew him to it. The crew are the real heroes of the voyage, their labour the real subject. If, on the other hand, we look for the chief, we find him firmly contextualised in the very first verse:

<gai>
Gum beannaicheadh Dia long Chlann Raghnaill
A’ chiad là do chuaidh air sàile,
E fhéin ’s a thréinfhir da caitheamh —
Tréin a chuaidh thar maitheas chàich.
<eng>

(“May God bless the ship of Clanranald / The first day that she went upon the sea, / Himself and his heroic men sailing her — / Heroes surpassing all others’ excellence.”) The vessel is variously called birlinn le tighearna Chlann Raghnaill (‘a galley belonging to the chief of Clanranald’), long Chlann Raghnaill (‘the ship of Clanranald’, just quoted), Long MhicDhòmhnaill (‘MacDonald’s ship’, line 216), and bàrc MhicDhòmhnaill (‘MacDonald’s barque’). Clann Raghnaill it is who orders his gentlemen to deploy the crew, while at the end God is thanked for saving deagh Chlann Raghnaill (‘good Clanranald’) from a brutish death. So all in all Clanranald gets six cursory mentions, but as a shadowy figure who is never given his correct Gaelic title Mac Mhic Ailein. The poet has mixed his traditional metaphors, superimposing a heroic crew upon the warrior chief. It is the crew who are sailing the ship of state.

If there is a satirical message, then, it must be directed at Ronald MacDonald of Clanranald, the Benbecula man who became chief in 1730 and who remained inactive in 1745 while his son brought out his mainland followers and his brother kept the men of South Uist and Benbecula firmly at home. If it is an allegory, the storm that nearly destroyed them is the ’45, and the heroes and sufferers of the clan are not its leaders but its people.

A slightly different interpretation is suggested by the fact that the birlinn sets out on Là Fhéill Brìghde (St Brigid’s Day, the spring

[TD 473]

quarterday, 1 February), see line 220. This is an unlikely time of year for a voyage and has no link with the ’45. Its importance is metaphorical. The quarterdays are lucky for new beginnings such as starting a voyage. The spring quarterday is a celebration of the renewal of fertility through the people’s labour in ploughing, sowing, harrowing and manuring the ground, so by this argument the poem speaks to us of a new social contract for the people. As for the galley’s itinerary, due south past Islay to Carrickfergus, this may take us back via the Islay-based kingdom of the Isles to the Irish origins of the Gael, or forward to a dream of Gaelic unity, or both. A manuscript of the ‘Birlinn’ lies in the Royal Irish Academy among the papers of the contemporary Catholic Irish scholar and pamphleteer Charles O’Conor of Belanagare. This suggests that the poem may have been inspired by a correspondence with him, and since a great deal of his correspondence survives, an avenue exists for further research. See John Lorne Campbell, ‘The Royal Irish Academy Text of “Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill”’, Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 9 (1961–62), pp. 39–79.

The poem was first published by the poet’s son Ronald in the Eigg collection of 1776, pp. 146–66. The Revs A. and A. Macdonald included it in The Poems of Alexander MacDonald (Inverness, 1924), pp. 370–401, with a verse translation entitled ‘The Barge of Clanranald’. There have been two scholarly editions since then, both without translation: Angus MacLeod, in Sàr Òrain (Glasgow, 1933), pp. 21–129 and 227–29, and Derick S. Thomson, in Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair: Selected Poems (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1996), pp. 132–65, with a complete source-list at p. 132. MacDiarmid’s translation is most easily found in his The Golden Treasury of Scottish Poetry (London, 1946), pp. 65–85, with notes at pp. 378–79; it is perhaps not generally known that a translation by the late Albert Mackie was published in The Scotsman, 10 and 17 July 1967.

I have chosen to print about half of the poem, omitting the beginning and end. I have used Thomson’s text, occasionally preferring alternative readings from MacLeod’s. The poem opens with a traditional ship’s blessing, an equally traditional blessing of the arms, an incitement to row to the sailing-place, and an iorram (‘rowing-song’). The snéadhbhairdne then begins with a brief connecting section in which the oars are shipped and Dh’òrdaich Clann Raghnaill d’a uaislean / Sàr sgiobairean cuain bhith aca (‘Clanranald commanded his gentlemen / To set apart fine ocean mariners’). At the end of the poem is a tremendous description of a storm in which the ship’s keel scrapes the bottom and the drowned carcases of sea-creatures are seen floating on the surface. It is particularly difficult not to think of Culloden when the poet refers to Fàileadh is deathach na riofa / Gar glan thachdadh (‘The smell and smoke of the reefing sail / Completely choking us’) and to Talamh, teine, uisge ’s sian-ghaoth / Ruinn air togail (‘Earth, fire, rain and elements / Raised against us’); he also speaks at this point of peileirean beithrich (‘bullets of fire’, ‘thunderbolts’), of cogadh (‘war’), and of sìth

[TD 474]

(‘peace’). Says MacLeod (Sàr Òrain, p. 109): “There is no reason why the reef of the sail in particular should take fire.”

In an extended passage with traditional antecedents, the damage done to the ship is then described. After passing through the Sound of Islay, the storm exhausted, Thug sinn buidheachas don Àirdrigh / Chum nan dùilean / Deagh Chlann Raghnaill a bhith sàbhailt’ / O bhàs brùideil (‘We offered thanks to the High King / Up to the elements / That good Clanranald had been saved / From brutish death’). The oars are put out, rowing recommences, and the ship makes harbour safely at Carrickfergus: Ghabh sinn biadh is deoch gun airceas / ’S rinn sinn còmhnaidh (‘We took food and drink unstinting / And there we stayed’).

44–46 Sàr Òrain, pp. 86–87: “Sailing too near the wind allows gusts to strike the outside of the sail, causing it to flap and so to jerk the sheet (taod-aoire). Luffing also checks the speed of the boat. To avoid luffing, he ‘veers’ slightly, so that the sail will take the wind (gabhail) and that the boat will not lose ‘way’ (ruith). Compare the nautical order to the steersman – ‘keep her full and by’, i.e. maintain course, avoiding both luffing and unnecessary leeway.”

52 MacLeod remarks (Sàr Òrain, p. 87) that this man had general oversight of the sail and tackle, and may be regarded as the ‘mate’ of the birlinn.

78 MacLeod points out (Sàr Òrain, p. 89) that this refers to the hauling in of the sheet in a squall to prevent too much heeling over when bringing the boat into the wind.

82 MacLeod points out (Sàr Òrain, p. 89) that the lug or tack was attached to the weather bow, but was shifted along the gunwale towards the stern when the boat was running before the wind, or forward when the course was to windward. This shifting is the imrich of line 87. He refers to ‘An Duanag Ullamh’ (BGh 260): Dèantar a’ chluas don chìch thoisich / Dol san fhuaradh. (“The lug’s made fast to the forebreast / Going to windward.”)

110 MacLeod (Sàr Òrain, p. 91) interprets soistinn as ‘tranquillity’ (so-fhoistinn, ‘ease of rest’). “Thus fear gun soistinn would be a responsible person, full of concern for his task.”

181–83 MacLeod points out (Sàr Òrain, p. 95) that these two men were in charge of the guy-ropes that ran aft from the ends of the yard.

194–95 In Canna: The Story of a Hebridean Island (Oxford, 1984), p. 103, John Lorne Campbell mentions a Donald Johnston who held a half-pennyland in the Kirktown of Canna in 1749, and a P. MacCarmic and a John MacCarmic among the tenants of Sanday, to where the former tenants of Lag a’ Bhaile at Coroghon in Canna had been moved to make kelp between 1788 and 1805. Curiously, he states that the MacCormick in our poem is called Donald, although the name is Duncan in all sources.

[TD 475]

198–200 MacLeod comments (Sàr Òrain, p. 96) that these men would have to be ready to give a hand as required. “The man at the halyard, for instance, could not hoist the sail by himself, and all would bear a hand when the sail was reefed or lowered.”

230 I have translated fadadh-cruaidh as ‘a bit of rainbow’ because it means a portion of rainbow seen in stormy weather, otherwise known as a ‘dog’s tooth’ or ‘sun-dog’. Literally it is a ‘hard kindling’.


40. Aoir nan Luch

Lachlan MacPherson (c. 1723–67), younger of Strathmashie, was of a family which enjoyed considerable holdings in Badenoch from MacPherson of Cluny, and acted as wardens on the MacPhersons’ western march. His father’s mother was a daughter of MacDonald of Keppoch, and his own mother was a daughter of the Macintosh chief. He and his father played a full part in the ’45 as officers in the Prince’s army. His wife was a daughter of Archibald Butter of Faskally, who was factor on the Forfeited Estates in Badenoch and Lochaber. In his father’s old age he appears to have become de facto tacksman of Strathmashie, and he was therefore remembered as Fear Srath Mhathaisidh, see Thomas Sinton, The Poetry of Badenoch (Inverness, 1906), pp. 235–36. However, his father survived him.

Strathmashie (as I will call him) was a gentleman and a scholar, a man who enjoyed both comfort and influence. He is well known for the willing assistance which he gave James Macpherson in making his creative reconstructions of Ossian’s poems (see notes on poem 59). He was therefore, as John Mackenzie pointed out (SO 260), “not a poet by profession. He invoked his muse only when an object of approbation or animadversion presented itself, and attracted his notice: his observations and remarks were made on the customs and manners of men; his humour was directed against, and his ridicule exposed, excesses.”

His talent is therefore comparable to that of Rob Donn (for whom see notes on poem 26), but only up to a point. For one thing, he employed it in the interests of social control, not as a slightly wayward servant of an influential parish minister, but as a slightly wayward member of the ruling hierarchy of the district; for another, he wielded his power with a velvet glove, portraying himself toiling or carousing side by side with his people, and indulging in endearing bouts of self-mockery. An excellent example of this is ‘A’ Bhanais Bhàn’ (‘The White Wedding’), for which see Derick S. Thomson (ed.), Gaelic Poetry in the Eighteenth Century (Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Aberdeen, 1993), pp. 133–37, and p. 411 above.

A more surprising difference from Rob Donn lies in the fact that whereas the Sutherland poet is universally admired (if not idolised) to the present day, Strathmashie was cruelly unfortunate in being edited

[TD 476]

by a presbyterian minister of Victorian vintage, the Rev. Thomas Sinton of Dores (1855–1923), who had something against him. “His verses are usually of rough cast,” wrote Sinton (‘Gaelic Poetry from the Cluny Charter Chest’, TGSI 23 (1898–99), pp. 247–81: 262), “and certainly do not afford pleasant reading.” Even in a more considered judgement Sinton insisted that ‘the concatenation of vocables, in which he clothed his ideas, often reminds one of the jolting of a goods train’ (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 177).

Without Sinton, however, we might have as few as half-a-dozen of Strathmashie’s poems on which to base our own judgement; thanks to Sinton’s efforts, at total of at least fourteen survive, and our picture of the man is rounded out by the traditional memory of the Gaelic-speaking people of Badenoch in a way that is now irrecoverable. “On a clipping day old men used to speak of Fear Strath Mhathaisidh as though they had but recently been in his company, and recalled his quips and cracks and gibes and songs amid general merriment,” says Sinton (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. viii), and:

From the fact that old people always laughed heartily when his name or any of his pieces was mentioned, one could gather that his lampoons were keenly relished by his contemporaries … He is at his best in the mock-heroic vein. An accomplished musician, he was in the habit of singing his compositions to his own accompaniment on the violin (TGSI 23, p. 262).


With regard to the present poem, there is a persistent tradition, which can be traced backwards through the entire length of Gaelic literature in Scotland and Ireland, and forwards as far as the twentieth century, that rodents – both rats and mice – can be exterminated or caused to migrate by the power of rhyme. It is very well documented in two recent papers: Iain Thornber, ‘Rats’, TGSI 55 (1986–88), pp. 128–47, and, more especially, John A. Morrison, ‘Drumming Tunes: A Study of Gaelic Rat Satires’, TGSI 57 (1990–92), pp. 273–364. The poem is also interesting with regard to the development of Highland inns, which grew up along the principal highways during the eighteenth century, and nowhere more so than on the route from Perth to Inverness now marked by the A9. The stretch in question here is that from Dalnacardoch south to Dunkeld. Sinton (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 130) cites a rann from a later era about the progress of a wedding party, listing some of the stage-houses on the route north from Perth to Kingussie:

<gai>
Bracbhaist am Baile Chloichridh,
Lunch an Dail na Ceàrdaich,
Dìnneir an Dail Chuinnidh
’S a’ bhanais ann an Ràt.
<eng>

(“Breakfast in Pitlochry, / Lunch in Dalnacardoch, / Dinner in Dalwhinnie / And the wedding in Raitts.”) The poet brings the two themes together in order to express his opinion of the quality of

[TD 477]

hospitality available on his route south – at the inn of Dalnacardoch (lines 25–32), Blair Castle, the seat of the Duke of Atholl (lines 33–44), and finally, horror of horrors, the inn at Dunkeld (lines 45–64).

I take the poem from The Poetry of Badenoch, pp. 129–32. Sinton’s translation is at pp. 430–32. John Mackenzie had the song in manuscript; he chose not to print it, but wrote (SO 260): “Aoir nan Luch, although not destitute of merit, is not much to our liking.”


41. Òran do Chaora

Duncan Ban Macintyre (1724–1812) is the best-loved figure in all Gaelic literature, perhaps because he takes the view of a common man and articulates it with dazzling fluency. Born in Glen Orchy in Argyll, he served ingloriously on the Hanoverian side at the Battle of Falkirk (1746), worked as a stalker in the deer-forests of Coire Cheathaich, Ben Dorain and Glen Etive from 1746 to 1766, and was obliged to leave the Highlands when his beloved mountains began to be let out as sheep-farms. He served as a militiaman and member of the Edinburgh City Guard until about the turn of the century, and lies buried at the lower end of Greyfriars Churchyard in Edinburgh under a splendidly carved sandstone monument. His surviving corpus amounts to 63 poems totalling over 6,000 lines. See also notes on poems 17 and 49.

‘Òran do Chaora’ is the greatest of all Gaelic thigging songs (see pp. xxix–xxxii), made when Duncan Ban was in Glen Etive. For obvious reasons (lines 96–121) it is a waulking song, cf. poem 3. The sheep of the title is a whiteface of the old kind that were treasured as family retainers, kept close for milk (lines 26–33) as well as wool (11–23). The township ewes were not let loose around the hills, but kept together by a shepherd (34–35). Duncan received this one as a present from a lady in Lochaber (4–10). The ewe has served him wonderfully (24–25), but now a fox has killed her (36–53).

Having thus lost his source of wool (54–57), he makes a thigging journey around Glen Etive, beginning and ending at Dalness in the centre of the glen (58–91). Clearly this is the song which Duncan has given the women to waulk his cloth, and we have to imagine the cheers and whoops of delight from the audience at the waulking as each place in turn is mentioned. Duncan shows that thigging takes time and involves a good deal of hospitality, with news, stories, and a song or two in return. At lines 70–71 he reaches a dram-shop. The song itself is not made in a day any more than is his coat; perhaps lines 74–77 precede him on his rounds, brought by children running back and forth. At Kinlochetive he crosses the river and makes his way home by the other side of the glen (78–91). Duncan now gives two lines to the spinning, although it takes over a year (92–93), two to the weaving (94–95), twenty-six to the waulking (96–121, the climax), two to the drying (122–23), then, with an echo of MacCodrum’s problem (see poem 46),

[TD 478]

two to the only bit that is man’s work, the tailoring (124–25).

Perhaps the coat thus made (126–27) was the one Duncan wore about 1766 when he arrived in Edinburgh to join the City Guard. He returns to lamenting his lost ewe (128–55), not forgetting to thank his original benefactress again in case she sees fit to replace the gift (154–57), but ends in the endearing fashion that helped make him universally loved (158–61).

I take the text from Angus MacLeod (ed.), The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 132–45.

10 Coruanan is in Lochaber. It was the birthplace of Ewen MacLachlan (see poem 61).

148 We do not know when the poet and his wife Mary were married, but they appear to have had a large family, born c. 1753–73. See The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre, pp. xxix–xxxi.


42. Spìocairean Ruspainn

Although Rob Donn (for whom see poem 26) was Jacobite in sympathy, he was culturally a product of evangelical Presbyterianism. Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair had virtually abandoned the traditional practice of praising famous men when along came Prince Charles requiring a propagandist – other than in his Jacobite songs, therefore, we find little praise and much satire in his work. Rob Donn took the matter a stage further. His main subject was people, but he tried to describe them good-humouredly for whatever they were, be they good, bad or indifferent. As detailed comment on the world he saw around him, his poems are unrivalled in our century.

‘Spìocairean Ruspainn’ – or ‘Marbhrann do Chloinn Fhir Taigh Ruspainn’ (‘The Elegy for the Children of the Tacksman of Rispond’), as it is rather clumsily labelled in my sources – is perhaps the simplest and most brilliant of Rob Donn’s elegies. It is addressed to two bachelor brothers and their elderly maidservant, all of whom died in the same week. A week before the first of the three deaths, we are told, a pauper had been turned away empty-handed from their door.

The poem is in Mackintosh MacKay’s edition (1829), pp. 328–30; Morrison’s (1899), pp. 49–51; and Gunn’s and MacFarlane’s (1899), pp. 51, 95.

31 Dr John MacInnes tells me that this line is a bowdlerisation, what Rob Donn actually sang having been: Sann dh’ith iad, dh’òl iad, ’s chac iad (‘They ate, they drank, and defecated’).

39 Nì can be wealth generally, but as line 43 demonstrates, wealth in Rob Donn’s day was measured in cattle.

43 At Martinmas the good husbandman slaughtered as many of

[TD 479]

his cattle as were unlikely to survive the winter, held a feast with the fresh meat, and salted the rest down for the winter. The children of the tacksman of Rispond had no family to feed and could not bring themselves to give the meat away, so they left a surplus of cattle on the hill – which died, feeding only dogs and birds. Cf poem 43, lines 42–45.


43. Calum a’ Ghlinne

According to John Mackenzie (SO 365–66), Malcolm MacLean was from Kinlochewe in Ross-shire. He enlisted in the army as a young man, but eventually returned to his native county to live on his pension. He married a woman who, as Mackenzie puts it, was well worthy of being styled the sister of Job. He got the tenancy of a piece of land with grazing for two or three cows in Glensgaith, at the foot of Ben Wyvis. He had but one vice, drink, but was a good singer. The couple had one child, a daughter, who grew up to be a beautiful girl, but because of her father’s habits she had no dowry and therefore no suitors.

Our Calum once had to go to Dingwall on a summer’s day for a boll of meal. Dropping into a public-house to refresh himself, he met a Badenoch drover, who also, as Mackenzie puts it, liked to do occasional homage at the shrine of the red-eyed god. Gill after gill was called until they were gloriously happy. Calum forgot his meal, and the drover his cows, until the poet’s last sixpence was spinning on the table. “Well,” he said, “if I had more money, I would not go home for some time yet.”

“That’s easily got,” said the drover. “I’ll buy the grey horse from you.”

The animal changed owners, and another onslaught on ‘blue ruin’ resulted. Several stoups later, doing his best to lift his head and open his eyes, the poet said: “A Dhia, I must go now!”

“You must,” said the drover, “but I can’t see for the life of me how you can face your wife.”

“My wife!” said the poet. “Fuidh, man, she’s the woman that never said or will say worse to me than Dia leat, a Chaluim. God bless you, Calum.”

“I’ll lay you a bet of the price of the horse and the meal that her temper is not so good, and that you will get an entirely different salutation.”

“Done!” said the poet.

Off went the pair to the MacLean household, bringing witnesses. As the poet walked in he staggered and would have fallen in the fire (which was in the middle of the floor, as was normal in those days) if his wife had not flung her arms affectionately about him, exclaiming, “Dia leat, a Chaluim!”

“Ah!” said Calum. “Why speak softly to me? I have drunk my money and brought home no meal.”

“A heatherbell for that,” said his wife quaintly, “we will soon get more money, and meal too.”

[TD 480]

“But,” continued the poet, “I have also drunk the grey horse!”

“What does that matter, my love,” rejoined the excellent woman (as Mackenzie calls her). “You are still alive and mine, and never will we be in want. As long as my Calum is sound and hearty I will never have reason to complain.”

That was enough. The drover counted down the money. A few hours later Calum came back with the horse and the meal, too.

The poet died c. 1764; his daughter found a suitor, and according to Mackenzie she and her husband were living in the parish of Contin in the year 1769.

I take the poem from SO 365–66. It is also in the Eigg collection of 1776 (pp. 111–12), the Gillies collection of 1786 (pp. 231–32), the Inverness collection of 1806 (pp. 110–11), Mackenzie’s collection of 1836 (pp. 26–27), and the Menzies collection of 1870 (pp. 213–14). These sources are all very consistent, except with regard to the title, which is sometimes ‘Luinneag le Calum a’ Ghlinne’ (‘A Ditty by Calum of the Glen’) and sometimes ‘Mo Chailin Donn Òg’.

34 For the term bodach (‘serf, churl, clown, peasant’) see poem 37, note on lines 121–30. Its diminutive bodachan (line 42) is still more derogatory.

39 The ‘string’ will be a metaphor for poetry and song.

42–45 Cf. poem 42, note on line 43. Spring (February to April) was the season of maximum dearth, often referred to as a’ chaoile (‘the leanness, lean time’), cf. poem 22, line 119, and poem 52, line 55.

46–47 Some sources have Nach òl anns a’ bhliadhna / Bloigh trian a’ ghalain (‘Who don’t drink in the year / A measly third of a gallon’).

62 Some sources have m’ fhortan (‘my fortune’).

70 The words a bhith mòr mean literally ‘to be big, to be great’. Some sources have Se gaol a bhith mòr (‘It’s love of being great’).


44. An Long Éiginn

For the poet see poem 40. The story is told by Sinton (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 123):

Once upon a time, the Tacksman of Strathmashie, accompanied by a number of his retainers, proceeded to the Coille Mhór – or, Great Wood – of Loch Laggan, to obtain timber for a house which was being built. As there was no road along the loch side, they intended to float the cabers, and for this purpose were preparing a raft. But ere they had completed their arrangements, this structure glided out upon the water, carrying off one of the men. Amidst the noise of shouting, and the hurrying to and fro, which this mishap occasioned, the Tacksman

[TD 481]

perceived the humour of the situation, and after getting home – no one being a whit the worse – he composed this song, in which he makes merry over the contretemps which had occasioned such commotion. It is in his best style, and was very popular down to the present generation.


With regard to the chorus, the Rev. Archibald Macdonald has this to say in ‘Some Hebridean Singers and their Songs’, part 2, TGSI 16 (1889–90), pp. 253–66: 266:

The following stanzas are also of the nature of a sea song … I have not been able to localise them or state positively that they are Hebridean in their origin. I have heard it said, however, that they were composed by a lady of the Macdonald family of Sleat, but they afford no internal evidence as to their authorship or the person to whom they are addressed. Macpherson, Strathmashie, in the chorus of a song called “An Long Eiginn”, has borrowed a part of the chorus of this song …


Macdonald then gives the song, beginning with the refrain:

<gai>
Hó, nan tigeadh mo Robairneach gaolach,
Birlinn aig’ agus ceatharna dhaoine,
Dhèanainn-se mise —có theireadh nach fhaodadh?
B’ aighearach mise nan tilleadh a’ ghaoth sibh.
<eng>

(“Hó, if there came my beloved Robairneach, / Bringing his galley and war-band of men, / I’d celebrate — who’d say I couldn’t? / How I’d rejoice if the wind brought you back.”) The text is in the same metre but with no similarities to our poem – it is a simple love-song full of dignified heroic motifs. On Robairneach, note the line Cha b’e mo Robain-se soideanach suarach (‘My Robin wasn’t a worthless blockhead’). This suggests to me that robairneach (‘a smart lad’) is a variant of the name Roban (Robin) influenced by English ‘robber’.

I take the poem from Thomas Sinton’s The Poetry of Badenoch (Inverness, 1906), pp. 123–25. His translation is at pp. 427–28.

55 Cf. poem 16, note on line 19.

72 I take this to be a little piece of self-mockery characteristic of the poet – he wakes up to discover himself in bed the next day with the door swinging open. Note that although the last word rhymes with aighear, ghabhail and sgallais, we need not assume a pronunciation daras. See poem 4, note on line 24.


45. Am Bruadar

Dugald Buchanan (1716–68) is the most influential of our Gaelic evangelical poets, and is conventionally regarded as one of the six outstanding Gaelic poets of the century, the others being (in order of birth) John MacCodrum, Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, Rob Donn,

[TD 482]

Duncan Ban Macintyre and William Ross. His work has extraordinary power, derived from his ability to relate his scriptural message to the daily lives and natural environment of his audience.

Buchanan was born at Ardoch in Strathyre in southern Perthshire, the son of a farmer who was also a miller. Growing up as he did on the very edge of the Gaelic-speaking world, he fell victim to the kind of personal identity crisis which came to typify young Gaelic speakers from the Islands during the second half of the twentieth century. It is hard to imagine a worse upbringing. His father and mother were both religious. His mother, Janet Ferguson, used every imaginable precaution to keep him from the company of other children, claiming that they had been let loose by their parents and that he would be tainted by their vices. She then died when he was 6 years old. Formal education (see notes on poem 21) took over as the main influence on his life, and he spent thirty years trying to sort himself out spiritually (or, as we say nowadays, psychologically).

By the age of 12 he was a tutor in a private household. He became a habitual keeper of diaries (in English). We read of a pious mistress in a house full of sinners, of how he regularly broke the Sabbath, constantly dreamed of Judgement, and lived in a kind of stupid despair. We read of a night storm, of escapes from drowning, from fever and from bayoneting by unruly soldiers, and of periods in schools in Stirling and Edinburgh. Despite his education he became a carpenter’s apprentice in Kippen and Dumbarton (a very twenty-first century touch). We read of drunkenness, of an intense desire to blaspheme, of struggles with atheism. His ‘Confessions’ are full of immature ramblings about vows and covenants with God (he wrote these down with lists of sins, etc.) and about how he communed with the Lord ‘at the cave of this rock, August 6, 1743’. His struggles were often of the physical kind.

About this time I went to a neighbouring congregation, where the sacrament of the Lord’s supper was to be administered, not to partake, for I was very unfit for such an ordinance. Here I had great awakenings of conscience by the doctrine I heard, being thereby persuaded, that notwithstanding all my reformation my state was yet wrong. Coming home at night I fell into great distress, and, no person being along with me, I remained a considerable part of the night upon the road, sometimes crying, sometimes praying, and at other times throwing myself upon the ground, careless of the hurting of my body. (The Diary of Dugald Buchanan (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 49–50)


Highly intelligent, a psychological mess, and possessed of great dramatic flair, Buchanan was not the kind to keep quiet about his spiritual life. He burned his secular songs, publicly no doubt. “Behold the Whig!” said some of his friends. Others said: “Alas! We have lost him.” “Others,” he informed his diary, “advised me to forsake the reading of books, otherwise I would lose my judgement. Others again said that I was really mad.” When later in life the Presbytery of Dunkeld

[TD 483]

were approached to license him as a minister, some members hinted ‘that Buchanan’s addresses were of such a wild, inflammatory character that they were more fitted to fanaticise than to edify’.

In 1749 Dugald Buchanan married Margaret Brisbane, a daughter of the maor or ground-officer of the Earl of Loudon, and in 1751, at the age of 35, he obtained from the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge the post of schoolmaster at Drumchastle on the newly forfeited estate of Lochgarry in the northern part of his native county. It was to make a man of him. Four years later the Society added to his duties those of catechist in the two forfeited estates of Lochgarry and Struan. Like Mac Mhaighstir Alastair in Ardnamurchan in the 30s and early 40s, he was expected to teach children English, arithmetic and the catechism in school every Tuesday to Friday, and to move through the townships instructing adults in the principles of religion every Saturday to Monday. This made him the sole bringer of the gospel to the most notoriously lawless part of the Highlands, the cattle-lifting district of Rannoch, once described as the home of ‘the greatest thieves in all Europe’. There was no more suitable person. Dugald was as wild in his own way as the people he had supposedly come to tame. His success as an evangelist was astonishing, his secret weapon being his poetic gift. The Rannoch people had little time for preachers, but great respect for poets. That is why he is careful to build upon aspects of traditional verse in his work. This is particularly obvious in ‘An Gaisgeach’, in which he paints a portrait of the ideal Christian hero to set against the secular leaders of the past. The hold which this truly extraordinary man possessed on the minds of the people is shown by the fact that, oral tradition or no, eight and only eight of his hymns survive, the eight which he himself decided to print. Given the norms of eighteenth-century Gaelic poetry, it is hard to believe that there were no others, no fragments. But if there were, they have disappeared without trace. It is as if Dugald Buchanan still has power over our minds today.

These eight hymns of Buchanan’s enshrine Christianity in theological order, God to man. ‘Mórachd Dhé’ (‘The Greatness of God’) proclaims God’s ineffable majesty. In ‘Fulangas Chrìost’ (‘The Passion of Christ’) the Saviour’s sufferings on the Cross are realised with astonishing power. The descriptive passages in ‘Latha a’ Bhreitheanais’ (‘The Day of Judgement’) may be regarded as Buchanan’s outstanding achievement. ‘Am Bruadar’ (‘The Dream’), notable for its imagery, is on the vanity of earthly wishes, and is the closest Buchanan gets to a simple lyric. ‘An Gaisgeach’ (‘The Hero’) provides the model for a type of hero (the Christian warrior) more suited to the new peasant society than to the old cattle-stealing one. In ‘An Claigeann’ (‘The Skull’) the poet comes down to social detail. Influenced no doubt by Shakespeare’s Hamlet as well as the English ‘Graveyard School’ of poets and the death imagery of traditional Gaelic verse (see p. 527), he uses the vocabulary appropriate to different walks of life to show that beautiful women, judges, physicians, generals, drunkards, gluttons, landlords, ministers

[TD 484]

and the wicked (in that order) must all prepare for death. In dealing with the landlord, for example, he mentions three kinds of rent: the grassum or entry fee, the màl or rent in cash, and the mòd, i.e. the barony court to which rents were paid in kind or in services.

<gai>
Tha nise do thràill
Gun urram ad’ dhàil,
Gun ghearsom, gun mhàl, gun mhòd.
<eng>

(“Your slave is now free / From showing you respect, / From grassum, from rent, from court.”) In ‘An Geamhradh’ (‘Winter’) he treats the prevailing fashion for seasonal poetry (see notes on poem 61) as an opportunity to depict winter as death and the other three seasons as the time to prepare for it. Finally, in ‘Ùrnaigh’ (Prayer’) he sums up all that is most important, leaving one feeling, as did the narrator of John Murray’s brilliant short story ‘A’ Chaora Chonadail’ (‘The Lost Sheep’): Chan eil e a’ creidsinn ann an càil ach Dia. “He doesn’t believe in anything except God.”

Buchanan’s Spiritual Songs was a best-seller, and was reprinted about forty times. He had the book published in Edinburgh in 1767 while carrying out the much weightier work of helping the Rev. James Stewart of Killin to oversee the printing of Stewart’s Gaelic translation of the New Testament. While in Edinburgh he also attended classes in the University in natural philosophy, astronomy and anatomy, and there is a very credible anecdote which puts him in contact with the philosopher David Hume. Hume challenged him to quote anything as fine as Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Act 4, Scene 1, lines 148–58, “… The cloud-capp’d towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, / And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, / Leave not a rack behind: We are such stuff / As dreams are made of, and our little life / Is rounded with a sleep.” Buchanan responded with Rev. 20: 11–13, “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it …” The sceptic Hume politely conceded the point.

The following year Buchanan was called home to attend to his family of two sons and two daughters, who were stricken with fever. He caught the infection himself. In his delirium he sang psalms and spoke much of the Lamb on the throne. He died shortly after at the age of 52 on 2 June 1768, and was buried with his forefathers at Balquhidder.

The above biographical account is compiled from: The Diary of Dugald Buchanan (Edinburgh, 1836); Rev. Allan Sinclair, Reminiscences of the Life and Labours of Dugald Buchanan (Edinburgh, 1875), which includes (pp. 145–94) a complete English translation of the eight hymns; Lachlan Macbean, Buchanan, the Sacred Bard of the Scottish Highlands (London, 1919), where his diary is again reproduced; Iain Moireach, An Aghaidh Choimheach (Glasgow, 1973), p. 97; Donald Meek’s entry on Buchanan in Nigel M. de S. Cameron, Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology (Edinburgh, 1993), p. 106; and my

own ‘Mac Mhaighstir Alastair in Rannoch: A Reconstruction’, TGSI 59 (1994–96), pp. 341–419: 353–63. See also Dòmhnall E. Meek, ‘Ath-Sgrùdadh: Dùghall Bochanan’, Gairm 147 (An Samhradh 1989), pp. 269–80, and 148 (Am Foghar 1989), pp. 319–31.

I have chosen ‘Am Bruadar’ because it is relatively short while containing some of Buchanan’s most lyrical passages. Donald Meek points out (Gairm 148, p. 319) that lines 49, 51 and 52 are all drawn from Gaelic proverbs. There is a good scholarly edition of the poems, Rev. Donald Maclean, The Spiritual Songs of Dugald Buchanan (Edinburgh, 1913), and I take my text from it (pp. 33–39). A Scots translation of ‘Là a’ Bhreitheanais’ has recently been published by James Robertson as The Day o Judgment (Kingskettle, 1999). A new edition of the poems, with translations, is being prepared by Professor Meek for the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society under the title ‘Laoidhean Dhùghaill Bhochanain (Dugald Buchanan’s Hymns)’, and is eagerly awaited.

46. Aoir nan Tàilleirean

John MacCodrum (Iain mac Fhearchair, 1693–1779) lived in North Uist, and was a noted satirist and wit. Thanks to heroic collecting work by the Rev. William Matheson in the 1930s, the surviving corpus of his verse amounts to 31 poems, not to mention ‘one or two pieces of a Rabelaisian nature which are not given here’, notably a satire on a woman of ill repute, ‘Òran na Muice’ (‘The Song of the Pig’), see Matheson’s The Songs of John MacCodrum (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1938), pp. xxii, xxxiii.

Tailoring was one of the few tasks in a traditional Highland community which were carried out by specialists. There were 25 tailors in North Uist in 1794. Tailors were often lame and considered the very antithesis of heroism, but the peripatetic nature of their work made them important as bearers of news, songs, stories and tradition. It is no coincidence that the greatest twentieth-century Gaelic poet, Sorley MacLean, was a tailor’s son. MacCodrum himself was a great tradition-bearer, particularly noted for his Ossianic tales and ballads. In 1760, James Macpherson (for whom see poem 59) came to the island to look for him. A bheil dad agad air an Fhéinn? said he, using an expression which was normal in the ceilidh-houses of his native Badenoch. “Have you anything on the Fingalians?”

In Uist, where there is no tradition of this being said in the ceilidh-house, it is, to put it mildly, ambiguous. It is more likely to mean “Do the Fingalians owe you anything?” MacCodrum took full advantage. Chan eil, he replied, ’s ged a bhitheadh, cha ruiginn a leas iarraidh a-nis. “No, and if they did, there would be no point in my looking for it now.”

[TD 486]

MacCodrum and Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair were a much better match, and hugely enjoyed each other’s company whenever the latter visited North Uist, see p. xxxvi. A manuscript version of the Ossianic tale ‘Cath Fionntràgha’ in the latter’s hand, now NLS Adv. MS 72.2.11, was probably taken down from MacCodrum’s dictation.

‘Aoir nan Tàilleirean’ is of biographical importance as having led in 1763 to MacCodrum’s appointment as family poet to Sir James MacDonald of Sleat. This is how it happened, according to an account written in 1898 by Malcolm Ferguson, Long Beach, Port Morien, Cape Breton, who had emigrated from South Uist in 1843. MacCodrum was living in a rather remote place called Langash on Loch Eport. His wife used to make pieces of cloth, and he went once or twice to get a tailor, but none would come. They did not want to work at Langash because there would be no fun there, dancing, or anything of that kind. So MacCodrum composed our song to them, and when they heard it they swore they would not sew a stitch for him even if he had to go naked. (They could probably have forgiven him everything except the last verse, which is libellous.)

Sir James was in the habit of coming to the island every autumn along with his retinue of family and friends. There would be a great display the day he arrived. Many of the tenants would gather around, praising himself and his father and his grandfather. When he arrived in August 1763 MacCodrum went too, but was so ashamed of his ragged clothing that he stayed on the fringe of the gathering. Sir James noticed him, and asked his chamberlain who that poor fellow was. Siud MacCodrum am bàrd! “That’s MacCodrum the poet!”

Agus ciod a chuir cho luideach e? “What has left him so ragged?”

Tha nach fhaigh e tàilleir a nì car dha. “It’s that he can’t get a tailor to work for him.”

S cinnteach nach eil e gam pàigheadh, ma-tà, says the chief. “Surely he doesn’t pay them, then.”

Thà, says the chamberlain, ach rinn e òran daibh, ’s cha tig duine aca thuige. “He does, but he made them a song, and none of them will work for him.”

Abair ris tighinn far a bheil mi. “Tell him to come where I am.”

MacCodrum comes forward, and the chief asks him why he is so bare. He explains that he cannot get tailors to come because of the song he made about them. The chief asks him to sing the song, which he does. Says the chief to the chamberlain, Thoir thusa dha deise aodaich air mo chosg-sa, ’s bheir mise dha an t-àite sa bheil e fuireach saor gun mhàl mar bhàrd. “You give him a suit of clothes at my expense, and I will give him the place where he lives free of rent as a poet.”

He receives in addition a grant of money and five bolls of meal a year. When John hears about the meal he says, Gun neartaicheadh Dia sibhse, Thighearn, is math an t-aran, ach b’ fheàirrd’ e an t-annlan. “God strengthen you, my Lord, bread is good, but it would be the better for something to put on it.” So Sir James, no doubt surrounded at his levée

[TD 487]

by all sorts of rents paid in kind, throws in five stones of cheese as well.

Sir James’s action was no doubt influenced by current literary excitement about the ‘discovery’ of the poems of Ossian; in a letter written from North Uist on 19 September 1763 to Sir William Pepys he wrote, “My only recreation is to call in an old bard I keep, and make him repeat Ossian’s poems for half an hour every evening.” Sir James died in 1766 and was succeeded by his less benevolent brother Alexander, see notes on poem 52.

I take the poem from Matheson’s The Songs of John MacCodrum, pp. 96–101; for the above biographical information see pp. xxiv–xxv, 269–75. A revised edition of this classic work, which is out of print, is being prepared by Professor William Gillies and is eagerly awaited.

2 The inlets branching off Loch Eport.

11–12 The word mìlidh means a soldier (Latin miles). Specifically, Mìle or Mìlidh Easbàine was the legendary leader of the Gael when they conquered Ireland. His descendants are known to scholars as Milesians.

36 Robert was probably a Ferguson, as the name was little used by other families in North Uist.

47–48 Shoemakers had a reputation for mendacity. Matheson quotes these lines from a waulking-song where the girl objects to suitors of various occupations: ’S cha ghabh mi idir griasaiche, / Se briagan trian a cheàirde. (“And I certainly won’t take a shoemaker, / Telling lies is a third of his trade.”)

52 This refers to MacCodrum’s three marriages. The names of his first and second wives are not known. The third was Mary Robertson. He had one daughter, Mary, perhaps by his second wife. See The Songs of John MacCodrum, p. xliv.

65–72 Interestingly, Matheson saw fit not to explain this verse. I understand it as a threat – a sample of how the poet might choose to satirise MacVicar. The nature of the jeu d’esprit seems to be that the holes in MacCodrum’s clothes have been created by witchcraft in the same way that cream could be spirited out of milk, that the tailor responsible has made a banner out of the patches to show the Devil, and that this has gained him easy entry to Hell. No doubt MacCodrum thought this was rather subtle. MacVicar will have seen it differently, and the other two dozen tailors in the island appear to have acted in solidarity with him.


47. Cumha do Thighearna Chluainidh

For the poet see poems 40 and 44. The subject of the poem, Ewan MacPherson (Eóghainn Ruadh, 1706–64), was born at Nuide in Badenoch, son of Lachlan MacPherson, tacksman of Nuide, who led

[TD 488]

the MacPhersons at Sheriffmuir in 1715 and inherited the Cluny estate and chiefship in 1722. On his marriage in 1742 to Janet Fraser, eldest daughter of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, Ewan took over the management of the estate and proceeded to carry out a series of economic developments which were highly beneficial to his people. During 1742–44, on the basis of earlier experiments such as those of Rob Roy MacGregor (see notes on poem 27), he organised a ‘watch’ to protect Badenoch from cattle-lifters from further north and west (lines 73–80). “Begun on a small scale, the idea had caught on,” says Alan G. Macpherson (A Day’s March to Ruin, p. 3): “his system of protection, run on sound financial principles, had been extended to embrace most of the Eastern Highlands and adjacent lowlands from Banff to the Braes of Angus.”

The result was that by 1745 Cluny had a well-trained force under arms and was in good odour with the government. In June that year he received a captaincy in Loudoun’s Highlanders, and was negotiating a further extension of the Watch to estates in the north-east when the ’45 broke out. While he was preparing to march with his company to join his regiment at Inverness he was arrested at his home on 28 August by a party of Lochiel’s Camerons. He was brought to Perth, where he met Prince Charles, and by 7 September he had been persuaded to change his mind and throw in his lot with the Jacobites, for whom his volte-face (if such it really was) was a considerable coup.

Col. Ewan MacPherson of Cluny and his regiment went on to serve the Prince with great distinction, particularly at Clifton on 18 December 1745 and at Falkirk on 17 January 1746. On 30 June, while Badenoch was being savagely plundered by the victors of Culloden, Ewan’s father died amidst the ruins of his estate, thus ensuring beyond all doubt that it would be forfeited. During part of August and September the new chief had the doubtful honour of sheltering the defeated Prince in the mountains of Badenoch, most notably in the ‘cage’ on Ben Alder, for which see also notes on poem 33. This was an ingenious two-chambered structure of timber and ropes enclosing a few square yards of space between a rocky outcrop, some growing trees, and the side of the mountain.

The Prince departed from Loch nan Uamh in Arisaig (where he had arrived a little over a year before) on 20 September 1746, leaving Cluny to fend for himself in Badenoch. For nine remarkable years he evaded capture, using the cage and many other locations. Finally, at Prince Charles’s request, in May 1755 he made his way overland to what proved to be a miserable exile in France. Ten years of hardship and narrow escapes had wasted his body, and he died in Dunkirk on 30 January 1764. He was buried in the garden of the Carmelites, not, as Sinton alleges (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 235), because he was a protestant, but for fear of desecration of the grave.

Sinton had once written of Strathmashie that ‘his elegy upon Cluny of the “Forty-Five” does not contain a trace of true poetic feeling’, see

[TD 489]

his ‘Gaelic Poetry from the Cluny Charter Chest’, TGSI 23 (1898–99), pp. 247–81: 262. This is a libellous claim, which Sinton saw better than to repeat in The Poetry of Badenoch. It is a model elegy in the formal style, carefully sculpted, praising Cluny for his heroism in the cause of peace, and rising to an impressive climax in its cumulation of kennings (see p. 527). I regard it as one of the outstanding Gaelic poems of the eighteenth century, a demonstration that the superb craftsmanship of the great elegies of the Sheriffmuir period lived on until after the ’45.

I take the poem from The Poetry of Badenoch, pp. 234–39. It is also in SO 260–61 and in EUL MS Mackinnon 10B (Benjamin Urquhart), ff. 169r–171v (pp. 56–61), which supplies one or two good readings. In addition to Sinton’s translation in The Poetry of Badenoch, pp. 489–92, there is one in GUL MS Gen. 1090 (14), the papers of George Henderson, beginning: “There is many a hardship incident to / Each generation which this evil world beholds.” An earlier draft of my own translation was published in Alan G. Macpherson, A Day’s March to Ruin: The Badenoch Men in the ’Forty-Five and Col. Ewan Macpherson of Cluny (Newtonmore, 1996), pp. 251–53; it is from this work that I take most of the above biographical information.

14 Rìgh na Gréine (‘the King of the Sun’) is God.

15 Urquhart has as géire breith – the same meaning more neatly put.

38 For faoilleach see note on poem 61, lines 165–68. Urquhart uses the common variant faoilteach, in the plural: Mar fhaoiltich [’s] stoirm gan dùblaigeadh (‘Like wolfwinds as storms redouble them’).

44 Or luath-làmh (Urquhart).

48 More literally ‘A host in contention would be cut down by him’. Urquhart has the interesting variant gun ainneart for san aimhreit – ‘So he’d cut down a host without excessive violence’ – but unfortunately this does not provide adequate end-rhyme with campar air : làmh e : nàmhaid e and has to be rejected. The same point is made at lines 55–56 in any case.

60 Urquhart here provides a footnote: “The author by his Mother side was a near relation of the Family of Keppoch.”

79–80 The poet appears to mean that, thanks to Cluny’s watch, cattle could now be left in the wilderness without buachaillean (cowherds).

49. from Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain

For Duncan Ban Macintyre see poem 41. ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’, one of the greatest poems in the Gaelic language, was composed during the years between 1751 and 1766. It is set to the pìobaireachd-based metre which was made fashionable in 1751 by the publication of ‘Moladh Mòraig’ (poem 24). During some of the years 1746–66 (we do not know exactly which) Duncan Ban lived at Ais an t-Sìthein (for which see line 120) at the eastern foot of Ben Dorain, whose distinctive conical shape remains familiar today to travellers north by road and rail from Tyndrum to Rannoch Moor and Fort William. Angus MacLeod places it chronologically last amongst the poems published in 1768 following the poet’s reluctant removal to Edinburgh, and advisedly so: it is the product of a refined talent and a mature imagination, of a richly gifted individual at the zenith of his ability. ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’ is supreme.

It is said (cf. SO 217) that on one of his journeys far north in the Highlands Donnchadh Bàn encountered a stranger who said with delight: An tù am fear a rinn ‘Beinn Dóbhrain’? “Are you the man who made ‘Beinn Dóbhrain’?”

Cha mhì, says Donnchadh. “No.” Se Dia a rinn i. Is mis’ am fear a mhol i. “God made it. I am the man who praised it.”

Commentators over two centuries since then have spoken of the poem’s fluency and vigour, its awesome word-power and detailed descriptiveness. But between 1969 and 1977, an era of vigorous debate about Gaelic verse, two perceptive modern views of it emerged which were astonishingly different. One was Iain Crichton Smith’s introductory essay in his booklet Ben Dorain: Translated from the Gaelic of Duncan Ban Macintyre (2nd edn, repr. Newcastle, 1988). The other was William Gillies, ‘The Poem in Praise of Ben Dobhrain’, Lines Review 63 (1977), pp. 42–48. Gillies conveniently summarises the poem for us.

The first movement prefigures the main themes – the mountain, the deer and the hunt. The second and third explore the relationship between the deer and the mountain, through the images of nurse and children and of host and guests. The fourth starts with the flora and fauna of the mountain – its fruits and herbs and so on, leading back to vignettes of the buck and doe who are its highest form of life. The fifth devotes a ground to the doe, and attempts to define the particular excellence she embodies. Then follows a variation in which the poet sings of his own devotion to certain specific glens and corries. The fourth and last ground (i.e. movement VII) gathers the threads together – the wide mountain, the deer and the men who frequent it for the hunt. Then, in the finale, the characters are set in motion together, as Duncan describes the pursuit and killing of the deer.


Smith finds much to please his senses in all this – gaiety, music, animals – but nothing to engage his brain except, as he quaintly puts it, ‘information’.

[TD 491]

People like to learn. And we learn a lot about deer from this poem as well as about the mechanism of eighteenth century guns. There is also some information about plants and the techniques of hunting.


“There is no moral,” says Smith, and, still more surprisingly, “It has no ending.” To me, this is like saying that the Gospel of St Matthew has no ending. “It has an obsession with observation,” he adds, but, as Gillies points out, “Bardic verse ranked visualising much more highly than seeing.” What is this visionary quality that Gillies perceives?

When Duncan Ban asserts the right of the deer to live on the mountain because her ancestors took possession of it I … think of Duncan Ban’s own countrymen in the 1760s; and at the points where the bardic strains are most insistent the absence of a lord of the hunt or a husband for the mountain is striking and pointed … I am prepared to see ‘Moladh Beinn Dobhrain’ as a serious and courageous attempt to create a dialectic for the expression of some pretty powerful ideas.


These ideas relate to the eighteenth century in that, in a clear but coded manner which would have been well understood by Duncan’s ceilidh-house audience, they assert the right of a territory’s ancient inhabitants to possession of its land, and the sacred obligation upon the people’s leaders to treat that land as more than a mere hunting preserve, noble and important though the hunt may be. They relate to the twenty-first century in that we may now look at the denuded Ben Dorain and the deserted landscape of the Highlands and think of the teeming society that once dwelt there, the complexities of people’s relationships and the richness of their culture. ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’, then, is no less a memorial to the year 1766 than is a field of neat crosses in Flanders to the year 1917.

Smith concludes of Donnchadh Bàn: “He was not a neurotic. It was not his job to seek relationships. He would never have dreamed of using the deer as symbols for anything.” But then, the irony of this having seemingly struck him, he adds significantly: “It is a very strange poem for a Highlander to write.”

The reality, in my opinion, is that it is not a strange poem but an accurate reflection of events and a logical, even inevitable, development of the rhetorical codes of Gaelic verse. It had already been prefigured by 1600 when, in ‘Òran na Comhachaig’ (‘The Song of the Owl’, BGh 249–59), the inhabitant of another corner of Rannoch Moor, a Glencoe MacDonald called Dòmhnall mac Fhionnlaigh nan Dàn, spoke of the appearance of alien influence in the Highlands and registered his admiration for the leaders of the past without endorsing those of the present. His only approval was for the deer, whom he repeatedly described in anthropomorphic terms.

<gai>
Gur h-àlainn sgèimh an daimh dhuinn
Theàrnas o shireadh nam beann —
Mac na h-éilde ris an t-sonn
Nach do chrom fo speinns a cheann.
<eng>

[TD 492]

(“Handsome is the form of the brown stag / Who descends from searching the hills — / The son of the hind by the pillar of battle / Who never bowed his head under wall-recess.”) The deer are employed as symbols in a call for family values, sobriety, and withdrawal from the violent excesses of contemporary Christianity – a revolutionary plea no less passionate than that made 200 years later by Rousseau.

The link between the Owl’s Song and ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’ is demonstrated by a glance at the map. Strung out from west to east across the Argyll–Perthshire border are Ben Dorain and the three most southerly peaks mentioned in the Owl’s Song – Beinn Fhuaran, Creag Mhor and Beinn Heasgarnich. Coire Cheathaich, the subject of two songs by Donnchadh Bàn which describe the condition of the corry under good and bad rulers respectively, nestles between the southern wings of Creag Mhor at the top of Glen Lochay. Creag Mhor is specifically mentioned in both ‘Òran Coire Cheathaich’ and ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’. In section 5 of the latter Duncan says of the doe:

<gai>
S tric a ghabh i cluain
Sa Chreig Mhòir
On as miosail leath’ bhith Luan
’S a Dhòmhnach ann.
<eng>

(“Frequently she browsed / On Creag Mhor / For she loves being there on Mondays / And on Sundays.” Which means all the week round, really, see Alexander Cameron, Reliquiæ Celticæ, vol. 2 (Inverness, 1894), p. 478.) The northern spur of Creag Mhor and the eastern spur of Ben Dorain are both called Meall Tionail, a name which, again, is mentioned in both ‘Òran Coire Cheathaich’ and ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’ (section 6 this time).

It is clear, then, that Duncan Ban found himself placed in charge of a hunting-ground that had been immortalised by Dòmhnall mac Fhionnlaigh, and that he was inspired by this. Some lines of our poem read like a commentary on the Owl’s Song – line 93, for example, which makes a relevant point about Dòmhnall’s reflections on old age; line 114, where the deer seek no human habitation; and line 179, which extols the virtues of water in preference to wine.

Of the eight sections, I have chosen to reprint the first three, i.e. 216 of the poem’s 554 lines. I take them from Angus MacLeod (ed.), The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 196–206.

42 Patrick is said to have been the eldest son of the Jacobite Duncan Campbell, Lord Ormelie, and to have directed the hunt from a seat near Coire Chruiteir on Ben Dorain, see Alexander Sinclair, Statement of the Breadalbane Case (Glasgow, 1866), p. 19:

Patrick had a seat in Coire-chruiteir, where he sat, directing the chase; and the opposite hill was set apart for hard-pressed deer,

[TD 493]

the gaining of which, by a mettlesome stag, was the immediate signal for the discontinuance of the chase. His seat was held in great veneration long after, and used to be visited by ardent young sportsmen, that they might have the honour to sit on Big Patrick’s seat.


If the only human being to be named in the poem was a Jacobite whose seat was venerated like that of a saint, it would seem that Ben Dorain had iconic status before ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’ was made. This is surely of fundamental importance to the interpretation of the poem.


50. Ailein Duinn

The story of this very popular waulking song is told by the Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair in The Gaelic Bards from 1715 to 1765 (Charlottetown, 1892), p. 253.

Allan Morrison, son of Roderick Morrison of Stornaway [sic], was a sea-captain. He generally traded with his vessel between Stornaway and the Isle of Man. In the spring of 1768 he left Stornaway in his vessel to go to Scalpay for the purpose of going through the ceremony of marriage contract, an reiteach, with Annie Campbell, daughter of Campbell of Scalpay. A furious storm having sprung up the vessel was swamped; and Captain Morrison and all on board sank with it. The broken-hearted Annie wasted away through grief, and died a few months afterwards. Whilst her relatives and friends were crossing over in boats from Scalpay to Rodel, where she was to be buried, they were overtaken with such a violent storm that the coffin had to be thrown overboard. Shortly after her death Captain Morrison’s body was found at the Shiant Isles. A few dates [sic] later her own body was found in the same place. Whether they were buried side by side or not, they should have been.


Many different versions and translations of the song have been published, the most recent being in J. L. Campbell (ed.), Hebridean Folksongs I (Oxford, 1969), pp. 44–49, 161–62, and Margaret Fay Shaw, Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist (2nd edn, Oxford, 1977), pp. 258–61. In her first edition (1955) Shaw mistranscribed the date given by Sinclair as 1786. This error went unnoticed and was repeated by J. L. Campbell.

The story is just as popular as the song and has been frequently retold, see for example Mrs Mary Mackellar, ‘Highland Superstition. Chapter II’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 2 (1876-77), pp. 211–14.

I take the song from K. C. Craig’s Òrain Luaidh Màiri Nighean Alasdair (Glasgow, 1949), pp. 105–07. It was recorded by Craig in the 1940s from Màiri nighean Alastair ’ic Dhòmhnaill ’ic Dhòmhnaill ’ic Iain (Mearag or Màireag), Snishival, South Uist. For a full source-list see Hebridean Folksongs.

47–48 This motif of drinking the deceased’s blood has been the subject of much scholarly discussion. Examples of it can be cited from Irish and Scottish Gaelic literature and tradition from earliest times to 1773, i.e. a little later than our poem. See Alexander Carmichael, Carmina Gadelica, vol. 2 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1928), pp. 296–97, and Derick S. Thomson, ‘The Blood-Drinking Motif in Scottish Gaelic Tradition’, Indogermanica et Caucasica: Festschrift für Karl Horst Schmidt zum 65. Geburtstag (ed. Roland Bielmeier and Reinhard Stempel, Berlin, 1994), pp. 415–24.


51. Turas Dhàibhidh do dh’Arcaibh

For Rob Donn see poems 26 and 42. This poem is an outstanding example of his humour. A note first published in the 1829 edition explains that Davie served as a cowman with a gentleman a few miles from his own home. Once when he was bringing back some butter and cheese for his master’s table, he got a passage on a kelp boat that happened to be going his way. A storm arose, however, which swept them off to Orkney. Even if Davie had gone to the bottom, his neighbours would not have greatly mourned him.

There are indications in the poem that there were sound reasons for David’s unpopularity. Lines 10–12 show him impounding other people’s stock and petitioning a sheriff, while the symbols on his imaginary escutcheon (lines 28–30) suggest that his job involved patrolling the boundaries of his master’s estate for wandering goats and collecting rents in kind – not unlike the MacEwen referred to in the note on poem 22, line 104.

The reference to the minister’s young wife at line 55 dates the poem for us. The Rev. John Thomson (1735–1811), Murdoch MacDonald’s successor as minister of Durness, married Mary Robertson (1740–68) on 20 May 1765, just a few months after taking up his post in the parish. She bore him three children, the last, Francis, being born on 29 August 1768. She herself died on 13 September that year, to be followed by baby Francis on 24 November (Fasti). This means that our poem was composed between 20 May 1765 and 13 September 1768, when the poet was 51–54 years old.

I take the poem from Mackintosh MacKay’s edition of 1829, pp. 97–100. It is also in SO 210, Gunn’s and MacFarlane’s edition, p. 50, and Morrison’s edition, pp. 199–202.

52. Òran do na Fògarraich

For the poet see poem 46. Says William Matheson, The Songs of John MacCodrum (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1938), p. 314:

The emigration which the bard deplores took place during the few years which preceded the outbreak of the American War. About 1770 there was a marked rise in rents all over the Highlands. The rents of North Uist, for example, were £1200 in 1763; in 1771 they amounted to £1800, and the rise was not entirely compensated by the rising price of kelp and farm produce. The change took place in 1769, in which year Sir Alexander MacDonald renewed the tacksmen’s leases for nineteen years. The result of higher rents was emigration on an extensive scale. Sir Alexander’s tacksmen formed themselves into a kind of company, and bought 100,000 acres of land in South Carolina, to which they emigrated en masse, taking many of their sub-tenants with them. Altogether, over two hundred people left North Uist between 1771 and 1775.


I take the poem from The Songs of John MacCodrum, pp. 196–203. Matheson’s principal source was the Stewart collection of 1804, pp. 464–69, where it is entitled: ‘Oran do Mhuinntir a chaidh do dh’America as na h-Eileanan Gaëleach. Air fonn, — “Air tuiteam a’m’ chadal,” le Mac Codrum.’ (‘A Song to People who went to America from the Western Isles. To the air, “Air tuiteam a’m’ chadal,” by MacCodrum.’)

56 Literally ‘under a druid of a fox’.

57 Until the advent of ‘dipping’, sheep were protected from ailments and parasites, especially the repulsive ‘fly’ (maggot), by annual smearing with a mixture of tar, butter and grease. In our period the grease would have been provided by ewes’ milk; whale oil came into use later. Smearing (smeuradh, smiaradh, smiùradh) was done once a year around Martinmas (11 November, or 23 November Old Style), using low-quality butter obtained as rents paid in kind at the Martinmas term-day. Smearing had given way to dipping in the Lowlands by c. 1885, but survived into the memory of today’s older generation in the West Highlands and Islands. Professor Derick Thomson tells me that he remembers it well. See my article ‘The Night of the Smearing-Pot’, WHFP, 20 October 1989.


53. Òran don Ollamh MacIain

The best account of James Macintyre (1727–99), tacksman of Glen Noe and chief of his name, is to be found in Angus MacLeod (ed.), The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 501–03,

[TD 496]

in MacLeod’s notes on the poem ‘Rainn Gearradh-Arm’ (‘Verses on Arms’), which Donnchadh Bàn made on a visit to Glen Noe when he was shown the seal bearing the Macintyre arms. Glen Noe, as MacLeod says, is a small, lonely glen lying north of Ben Cruachan and opening on to Loch Etive; the Macintyres had never owned it, but had held it as foresters successively to the Stewarts of Lorne and Campbells of Glenorchy and Breadalbane. James Macintyre was a scholarly man, however, with a passion for the Gaelic language which was most unusual for his day. He was one of a coterie of scholars who formed themselves into a society during the years 1771–76 and shared out the letters of the alphabet amongst themselves with the aim of compiling a Gaelic dictionary. The others, all ministers, were James MacLagan of Blair Atholl, Archibald MacArthur of Kilninian, Dugald Campbell of Kilfinichen, Charles Stewart of Strachur, John Stuart of Luss, and Donald MacNicol of Lismore. Portions of their work, which was never published, survive in the National Library of Scotland and the archives of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland at Ingliston, see my article ‘The Gaelic Academy: The Cultural Commitment of the Highland Society of Scotland’, part 1, Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 14, part 2 (1986), pp. 1–38: 16.

No doubt, as a lexicographer, the tacksman of Glen Noe worshipped the very name of Dr Samuel Johnson, whose celebrated Dictionary was published in 1755. He must have been delighted to hear in 1773 that the great man was coming to visit the Highlands and Islands, only to discover in 1775 when he read A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland that his idol had feet of clay. It was a commonplace of literary gossip that Johnson was sceptical about the authenticity of Ossian, and that the discovery of the facts of the case was a prime purpose of the visit (see notes on poem 59). But the ground was firm under any Gaelic scholar’s feet. If Johnson discovered Macpherson’s translations to be an acceptable rendering of the ballads, Scotland and Macpherson were vindicated. If he found they were not, it could only be because the ballads themselves had been presented to him in all their glory. That one of these two things would happen was certain, because the ballads still survived in abundance on the lips of the people, and because Gaelic had been a written language for a thousand years.

Imagine, then, the consternation of James Macintyre when he lit upon the following ill-considered outburst in the midst of Johnson’s agreeable discourse on the hospitality, civility and erudition of the people of the Isles (Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. Peter Levi (1993 edn, London), pp. 116–19):

Of the Earse language, as I understand nothing, I cannot say more than I have been told. It is the rude speech of a barbarous people, who had few thoughts to express, and were content, as they conceived grossly, to be grossly understood … I believe there cannot be

[TD 497]

recovered, in the whole Earse language, five hundred lines of which there is any evidence to prove them a hundred years old. Yet I hear that the father of Ossian boasts of two chests more of ancient poetry, which he suppresses, because they are too good for the English. He that goes into the Highlands with a mind naturally acquiescent, and a credulity eager for wonders, may come back with an opinion very different from mine; for the inhabitants knowing the ignorance of all strangers in their language and antiquities, perhaps are not very scrupulous adherents to truth; yet I do not say that they deliberately speak studied falsehood, or have a settled purpose to deceive. They have inquired and considered little, and do not always feel their own ignorance …

I suppose my opinion of the poems of Ossian is already discovered. I believe they never existed in any other form than that which we have seen. The editor, or author, never could shew the original; nor can it be shewn by any other; to revenge reasonable incredulity, by refusing evidence, is a degree of insolence, with which the world is not yet acquainted; and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt … It is said, that some men of integrity profess to have heard parts of it, but they all heard them when they were boys; and it was never said that any of them could recite six lines. They remember names, and perhaps some proverbial sentiments; and, having no distinct ideas, coin a resemblance without an original … The Scots have something to plead for their easy reception of an improbable fiction: they are seduced by their fondness for their supposed ancestors. A Scotchman must be a very sturdy moralist, who does not love Scotland better than truth: he will always love it better than inquiry; and if falsehood flatters his vanity, will not be very diligent to detect it …


Gaelic lexicography was abruptly cast aside. While the Rev. Donald MacNicol penned his measured Remarks on Dr Samuel Johnson’s Journey to the Hebrides, ultimately published in 1779, the chief of the Macintyres applied himself to a more demotic form of criticism. Our poem was published anonymously in the Eigg collection of 1776, pp. 318–21, while 31 lines of it appear in the Rev. James MacLagan’s manuscript collection under the heading ‘Air Samuel Johnson, Sagsonach ’nuair a scriobh e ann an aghaidh Albainn. Le Seumas Mac-an-t Saoir, Fear a Ghleinne Nodha – 1775’ (‘On Samuel Johnson, an Englishman when he wrote against Scotland. By James Macintyre, the Tacksman of Glen Noe – 1775’). These were published by the Rev. John Kennedy, ‘Poems from the Maclagan MSS’, TGSI 22 (1897–98), pp. 168–92: 177–78.

There followed three more songs on Dr Johnson, all a little more intellectual and a little less poetic than the first, and all in the Gillies collection of 1786: ‘Oran do’n Olla Shasgunnach, Samuel Johnson’ (‘A Song to the English Doctor, Samuel Johnson’, 29 stanzas and two choruses, pp. 173–79); ‘Oran Connsachaidh, &c.’ (‘A Song of Disputation, &c.’, 36 stanzas and two choruses, pp. 181–87); and ‘Oran do Mr. Domhnul Macneacail, Minisdeir Liosmoir, Eirson a ro scairtealachd agus a Chothaich e, ann Adhaigh an Olla Lunduinnich’ (‘A Song to the Rev.

great vigour with which he opposed the London Doctor’, 27 stanzas and chorus, pp. 189–94).

The Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair claimed (‘The Gaelic Bards and the Collectors of their Works’, TGSI 24 (1899–1901), pp. 259–77: 267), that all three of these poems in the Gillies collection were by James Macintyre of Glen Noe, leading Angus MacLeod to remark (The Songs of Duncan Ban Macintyre, p. 503) that ‘Dr Johnson, it would appear, became an obsession with James Macintyre’. While due weight should be given to Maclean Sinclair’s view, I think it likely that the poems in the Gillies collection emerged collectively from the ‘Highland gentlemen’s club’ as a more congenial activity than lexicography. Two of the six ministers were from Mull parishes well known to Maclean Sinclair, and while his information was no doubt communicated in good faith, it seems likely to me that James Macintyre, as the club’s lay member, was expected to shoulder responsibility for activities of this kind. The ascription to him in the MacLagan MSS is likely to be authentic, however.

The poem’s title in the Eigg collection is: ‘Oran do’n Olladh Shasgunnach, le Duine-uasal Araidh. Air fonn, Alastair dubh a Gleanngaradh’ (‘A Song to the English Doctor, by a Particular Gentleman. To the air, Alastair Dubh a Gleanngaradh’). ‘Alastair Dubh a Gleanngaradh’ is our poem 20.

31–32 The MacLagan MS reading here is: An fheòil as fheàrr nuair théid i dholaidh, / Dùblaidh a boladh air breunaid (‘The best flesh when it goes off, / Its stench doubles in smelliness’).

38 The text has geinichin; this is footnoted ‘i.e. geiheamhuinnin’, meaning presumably geineamhainnean ‘conceptions’.

41–48 There are very strong echoes here, and again at lines 81–88, of a passage ascribed to the Mull Herdsman in the flyting ‘Rannan eadar am Bàrd agus an t-Àireach Muileach’ (‘Verses between the Poet and the Mull Herdsman’). This is usually regarded as a genuine exchange between the Herdsman, whoever he was, and Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair, who died c. 1770, but was first published in MacLeod’s collection of 1811 (pp. 245–48). See Revs A. and A. Macdonald, The Poems of Alexander MacDonald (Inverness, 1924), p. 282.

75 The word maighdeige is footnoted: “A very small kind of Wilk without any meat in it.”

94 In a footnote ballan is glossed: “A kind of pillory anciently used in the Highlands, for punishing all liers and despicable offenders; It was a sort of frame erected on a pillar, on which the offender was fastened with a rope about his oxters, by which he hung exposed to the scoffs and ridicule of the spectators, who pelted him with rotten eggs, &c.” Clearly this is the source of Dwelly’s entry at ballan-stiallach. ‘Lashing-post’ is a more literal translation than ‘pillory’. Locations of punish-

[TD 499]

ment described in the court books of the Regality of Grant, c. 1700, are as follows: ‘ane post’ to which the offender’s ear is fixed with an iron nail; ‘the gallows of the moor of Belintomb’ where the same is done; ‘the gallow foot upon the moor of Belintome’ to which offenders are tied with hemp cords for scourging; ‘the pit of Castle Grant’ where offenders are confined; ‘the gallows of Belintome’ where thieves are hanged, an accomplice being bound to the gallows during the execution, after which his left ear is cut off and he is scourged and banished; ‘the hill of Bellintome’ where thieves are hanged; and ‘the Regality Cross at Grantown’, to which the offender is bound for scourging, after which one of her ears is cut off and she is banished. See Rev. W. Forsyth, In the Shadow of Cairngorm (Inverness, 1900), pp. 145–46.


54. Moladh na Luinge

Kenneth MacKenzie (1758 – c. 1837) was born at Castle Leather (Caisteal Leathoir) near Inverness. His parents were comfortably off, and gave him a good education. When about 17 years old he became a sailor’s apprentice, and took to a life at sea with great enthusiasm. He brought with him on his voyages the Bible his mother had given him and two other books – the Gaelic verse of Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair and of Duncan Ban Macintyre. These influenced him greatly, and most of his songs were composed at sea. Surprisingly, John Mackenzie found just four or five of his poems which ‘have stepped beyond the confines of mediocrity’, and suggested that although Kenneth MacKenzie ‘was evidently born with talents and genius … the habits of a seafaring man have a deteriorating influence over the youthful feelings’ (SO 270).

It is clear that Kenneth MacKenzie was understood to be homosexual, and I suspect that this influenced how John Mackenzie felt about him as a poet. His Òrain Ghaidhealach (Edinburgh, 1792) contains 55 original songs and four translations, with abundant evidence of a heterosexual appetite and much verse of high quality. Most notably of all, perhaps, his ‘Seònaid: Òran don Luing ’s do dh’Fhear Obair a’ Chuain’ (‘Janet: A Song to the Ship and to the Man who Works at Sea’), which John Mackenzie calls ‘Pìobaireachd na Luinge’, is a 312-line extravaganza in pìobaireachd metre inspired by ‘Moladh Mòraig’ and ‘Moladh Beinn Dóbhrain’, both of which are mentioned in it.

I take our poem basically from SO 271–72, with additions from Kenneth MacKenzie’s own book. It is interesting that John Mackenzie has a version different from that published by the poet himself. He does not mention his source, but it should be noted that the poet survived in Ireland to at least 1837 and had been in correspondence with his

[TD 500]

brother in Inverness c. 1818 (see notes on poem 58). It is clear, then, that John Mackenzie – who was born in 1806 and whose enthusiasm for collecting Gaelic songs had obviously set in by the time he published the work of William Ross in 1830 – had ample opportunity to obtain manuscripts of the poet’s work. I say manuscripts rather than an annotated copy of the published book, because I cannot otherwise explain why John Mackenzie should refer to a poem published under the title ‘Seònaid’ as ‘Pìobaireachd na Luinge’ or to one published under the title ‘Òran don Luing’ (‘A Song to the Ship’) as ‘Moladh na Luinge’ (‘The Praise of the Ship’).

The changes since 1792 are more than merely cosmetic. Our lines 5–12 and 69–72 are not in SO at all (although this may result from ruthless pruning by John Mackenzie of every stanza that did not refer to the ship or the sea). Our lines 57–68 appear in Kenneth MacKenzie’s book following our line 20. And there are many minor textual differences.

In Sàr Òrain (Glasgow, 1933), p. 99, Angus MacLeod compares ‘Moladh na Luinge’ favourably with ‘Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill’ (poem 39), citing our lines 21–24 and 29–32 as showing delight in ‘a wet sheet and a flowing sea’. Praise indeed, which Kenneth MacKenzie would have savoured. MacLeod adds: “There is no parallel in the ‘Birlinn’ to slinn and its associations.” The song is stated by the author to be to the tune ‘Tha mo rùn le deagh iùl / Do luchd giùlan nam breacan’.

21 The idea of the ship as a mare dates back at least to Murdoch MacKenzie of Achilty’s ‘An Làir Dhonn’ (‘The Brown Mare’) of c. 1650 (BGh 217–19).


55. Moladh Gheàrrloch

William Ross (1762—?91) was born in his father’s country of Strath in Skye. His mother was a daughter of John MacKay, the Blind Piper, for whom see poem 23. He was intelligent and highly musical, and his parents moved first to Forres to give him an education in the Grammar School there, then on to his mother’s land of Gairloch, his father taking up the life of a ceannaiche-siubhail or travelling packman – the eighteenth-century equivalent of shopkeeping. As a teenager William joined him on his travels, and found the experience stimulating both socially and intellectually.

When still in his teens, as is normal, the poet fell in love. The object of his passion was Marion Ross, daughter of a Stornoway merchant. She was a distant relation, older than himself, and unattainable, but his infatuation permeates his verse and has become the stuff of legend. In 1782 she married an English sailor, Captain Samuel Clough (1757–1815). It is said that on the night of the poet’s death, the door blew open at Marion’s home in Liverpool. Going downstairs to close it,

[TD 501]

the candle she was carrying set fire to her nightdress, and she was burned to death.

It is hard to disentangle the poet’s passion from physical illness. He contracted asthma and consumption. He appears to have gone to Edinburgh in 1782 to see what the ‘Faculty’ there could do for him, and was recommended to seek out the mountain air. This helps to explain his presence in the high country of Breadalbane during 1783–86. Our poem can be dated with some confidence to New Year 1783, when the poet was on his way into Breadalbane from Edinburgh, for the reason so clearly stated in the first stanza. He climbs Glen Ogle from Lochearnhead, crosses the Làirig Ìle from where he looks west into Strathfillan, descends to Glen Dochart and Killin to the east, then goes round by Coire Charmaig into Glen Lochay to the north.

At p. 182 of his edition Calder prints a note on New Year’s Day in Gairloch provided by Angus Morrison (for whom see An Tuil, pp. 28–41, 718–20). Shinty was traditionally played on winter holidays – St Andrew’s Day, Christmas, New Year’s Day, Handsel Monday, Epiphany, Candlemas – and lines 49–56 are as succinct a description as we have of the great festive shinty matches of the past. Given the loss of eleven days from the calendar in 1752, Nollaig Mhór (‘Great Christmas’, line 49) may here mean New Year’s Day, for that, according to Morrison, was when an annual shinty-match was played at the ebb-tide on the Gainmheach Mhór or Big Sand of Gairloch. No matter the location, the formula varied little: the young men of one community met the young men of another with sticks and a ball and plenty of courage, and tried to drive the ball as far as the other team’s goal, which might be marked by a couple of ankers of whisky or, even more symbolically, by the entrance to the opposition’s township. The ball was a solid cnag or knot of hazel root. The ‘Brae’ of line 56 might be Bràighe Thorasdail or Bràighe Mhiall or even the Braes of Portree, heroic hyperbole having been the stuff of shinty tradition ever since the infant Cù Chulainn wove his way between a hundred and fifty royal youngsters to score against the palace wall of Emain Macha. That there are undertones of violence is not surprising, for such shinty derbies took the place of clan battles, with no limits of time or place or numbers of men, and no rules but the survival of the soberest. What is perhaps of supreme interest, however, is how at line 55 Ross picks up the New Year theme of driving out the Hag with sticks, and how for this murderous lump of hazel that flies about the Big Sand of Gairloch he chooses the name of the cailleach’s maritime counterpart, the Muirgheardach, because my impression is that in return for hospitality the cailleach or last sheaf of harvest was removed and beaten to shreds by the goatskin-clad visitor and his stick-wielding friends who came around the houses on Oidhche Challainn or New Year’s Eve, see poem 36, note on line 3.

A number of Ross’s poems must have been lost forever when he committed them to the flames shortly before his death, but fifteen were published in the Stewart collection of 1804, and others appeared in other collections. John Mackenzie spent twenty-one nights taking down the surviving corpus from the lips of Ross’s friend and fellow-poet Alexander Campbell, Alastair Buidhe MacÌomhair, by then aged about 63. Mackenzie published them as Òrain Ghàëlach le Uilleam Ros (Inverness, 1830). A second edition followed in 1834, and was reprinted several times. A bowdlerised edition by the Rev. George Calder, with translations into doggerel, was published as Gaelic Songs by William Ross in Edinburgh in 1937. Altogether 35 poems survived.

I take the poem from Òrain Ghàëlach le Uilleam Ros (2nd edn, Glasgow, 1834), pp. 68–73. It is also in SO 286–87 and at pp. 66–73 of Calder’s edition, entitled ‘Moladh a’ Bhàird air a Thìr Féin, air dha bhith air Fàrsan ann an Tìr Choigrich’ (‘The Poet’s Praise for his Own Country, while Travelling in a Strange Land’). I have given it a new, shorter title.

56. Beachd Gràis air an t-Saoghal

Mary MacPherson (Bean Torra Dhamh, c. 1740 – c. 1815) was born in Laggan in Badenoch. Her father, Ewen MacPherson, was schoolmaster there, probably working at first for the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, and subsequently for the parish. He is thought to have been of the Strathmashie MacPhersons. At any rate, Mary clearly got a good education in both Gaelic and English.

She married young, and raised a family of children. Her husband, a man called Clark, had little to give her. He had a smallholding of poor land on a barren hill, Torra Dhamh, near the opening of Glen Truim. Its site, on a spot opposite Creag Dhubh commanding an extensive view of the Spey, was still pointed out early in the twentieth century. Clark would have held it as a tenant under a tacksman, or directly from Cluny’s land steward (maor fearainn).

As a young woman, like most Badenoch people Mary enjoyed music and dancing. We do not know when her experience of conversion took place, except that it was before 1785, as her autobiographical hymn ‘M’ anam, imich thusa sàmhach’ (‘O my soul, go quietly on’) was apparently published in pamphlet form in that year, thanks it seems to the patronage of Mrs Grant of Rothiemurchus. It is full of spiritual knowledge and mature Christian experience. If the Rev. John Rose is to be believed (Metrical Reliques, p. 101), she wrote: “I have been of a very bad and wicked disposition: therefore, the Lord was obliged to break my leg, which was the first means of bringing me to think of my sinful and lost condition.” Mary’s leg did not receive the attention needed to restore its full use, and from then on she had to use a crutch and lean on a stick.

Apparently the gift of poetry only came to her after conversion. Her first attempts were in English, which was providing Highland presbyterianism with its initial models for spiritual expression, but her husband persuaded her to switch to Gaelic, which no doubt he and his neighbours were much better able to understand. None of her English songs have been preserved; she is known to have committed thirty Gaelic ones to writing, but of these only seven survive.

Mary’s spiritual experience, as expressed in clear English prose and resonant Gaelic verse, is a model of Highland evangelicalism. “When awakened from my sinful lethargy and negligence, I have gone through great trouble of mind. I now saw that I was not only guilty in numberless instances of breaches of the holy law of God, but also that I had a sinful nature that loved sin, and would commit it” (Metrical Reliques, p. 101). She was ‘deeply disturbed’, as the Rev. Alexander MacRae put it, and began to search the Scriptures, ‘browsing in the Bible in the hope of finding mouthfuls of comforting mercy’. Among the passages in which she found relief were Isaiah 54: 7–8, where God says: “For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee.”

[TD 504]

The result was, says MacRae: “As she persevered in the life of faith, the wonders of grace grew more marvellous to her enraptured spirit, and she sang her joyful experience in glad music. Her hymns are full of wonder at the freeness and fulness of grace, and they have been a means of grace to many.”

The poems present a religious experience of passing through hardship to find great joy, and thus draw deeply upon existing Gaelic conventions of praise and love. When Mary turns directly to God she could quite easily be a professional poet praising his chief or a waulking woman praising her lover. The same curiously erotic strain can be found in the most influential Gaelic sermons of the nineteenth century, such as that delivered by the Rev. Dr John MacDonald of Ferintosh at Ardeonaig in summer 1816 on the text ‘Thy Maker is thine husband’. MacRae singled out the following verses of Mary’s with the comment: “She sang His praises as only His beloved can. Seldom has the Gaelic language been put to sweeter use. These words are heaven’s purest gold.”

“He’s the Rose of Sharon / And the Flower from Jesse, / He’s the Hero of Judea, / His strength is not crushed; / It’s His beauty above all others / That’s made me love Him so greatly, / And when He’s out of my sight / I’m gloomy, most sorrowful. / I’m sad when I’m seeking Him, / Always in private, / And when I see Him so radiant / I’m lit up with happiness: / He’s the jewel of my bosom, / He’s my friend and my husband, / He’s my eldest brother /Who helps me time and again.”

Mary’s husband died early, leaving her a cripple on a hill. Her children abandoned her as soon as they could manage for themselves: “Except one daughter,” says MacRae, “who is said to have been a living sorrow to her for years. Eventually she was won by her mother’s Saviour, and henceforth they understood each other better.”

The poorest of the poor, she was often in want, but had the double

[TD 505]

blessing of faith and of living in a traditional Highland community that believed in supporting its weaker members. She never complained. On the contrary, anecdotes underline her joy.

The catechist of the parish, while on his way to church on a Sabbath morning, heard unusual sounds as he approached her door, as of the quick movement of her crutches. On going in he found her as on other occasions, but before he left she reluctantly confessed that though it was the Lord’s Day, her soul was so happy in the over-flowing fulness of the Lord’s mercy and love to her that she had been enjoying a dance all by herself. She was really imitating David dancing before the Ark.


Another story has the catechist teasing her. Och, na boireannaich a tha sibh ann. “Och, you women.”

Mary: Ciod e nis tha sinn a’ dèanamh? “What are we doing now?”

Catechist: Bha mìle dhiubh aig Solamh agus cha robh té mhath ’nam measg. “Solomon had a thousand of them with not one good one among them.”

Mary: Tà, a dhuine, chan eil sin a’ cur dad a dh’iongnadh ormsa. “Aha, my friend, that doesn’t surprise me at all.”

Catechist: Car son sin? “How’s that?”

Mary: An saoil sib’ fhéin bean mhath sam bith an gabhadh i fear aig an robh mìle? “Can you imagine any good woman taking a man who had a thousand?”

The most famous anecdote of all concerns her answer when the Laggan communions were to take place and she was asked how many visitors she could accommodate. Tha sabhal agam a chumadh fichead, she said, agus cridhe a chumadh ceud. “I have a barn that would hold twenty, and a heart that would hold a hundred.”

About 1803 or 1804, when over 60, Mary travelled to Inverness with the manuscript of her thirty hymns in the hope of getting them published, but met only with disappointment. Soon after this, her eyesight failing, she was brought to Perth by her daughter, now married, to live out the rest of her days, and died there about 1815.

In 1786 John Gillies, Perth, reprinted the hymn that had appeared in 1785. Two more were published anonymously in Inverness by Alexander Fraser c. 1835, and again in Metrical Reliques of ‘the Men’ in the Highlands (Inverness, 1851), pp. 101–08, by the Rev. John Rose, who says that he took them down about 1814 from a girl who had them from the poet. The Rev. John Kennedy (Caticol, Arran), a Badenoch man, had these two reprinted in Edinburgh when he was a student in 1878 along with one more, adding his own translations of all three into English verse (Three Gaelic Poems by Mrs Clark of Torra-Dhamh, Badenoch). The Rev. Thomas Sinton found three more (including the present poem) in the Cluny charter chest, along with a version of one of those which had already appeared, and published them in his paper ‘Gaelic Poetry from the Cluny Charter Chest’, TGSI 23 (1898–99), pp. 247–81: 251–61. They were all in the same handwriting, perhaps

[TD 506]

Mary’s own, and addressed to Mr Paul Kennedy of Castle Gavel, Perth. Sinton published six of the hymns in The Poetry of Badenoch (Inverness, 1906), pp. 327–50, with translations at pp. 541–57. All seven were finally brought together in MacRae’s popular booklet Mary MacPherson (Mrs Clark), Bean Torra Dhamh: The Religious Poetess of Badenoch. It was published in Arbroath in 1935, a second edition following c. 1940. It is from this second edition (pp. 53–58) that I take the poem, as well as much of the above information.

1–2 The first two lines of the poem are identical to the beginning of Alastair mac Mhaighstir Alastair’s ‘Òran Àraid (Mar gum b’ann còmhradh eadar am Prionnsa agus na Gaidheil)’, published in 1751, for which see J. L. Campbell (ed.), Highland Songs of the ’45 (2nd edn, SGTS, Edinburgh, 1984), pp. 86–93. Mary’s song is not really a response to Alastair’s, which was much earlier; it is simply that Badenoch was steeped in Jacobite songs, and she would have been using the same air, which (as Campbell points out at p. 299) is Neil Gow’s ‘Good-Night, and God Be With You’.

46 What Mary calls the each-toiseach was an exaction which had been the subject of repeated legislation at least since 1617, when an Act of the Scots Parliament abolished the ‘calp’ or ‘heriot’ – the levying of death duty by a feudal superior (normally through his bailie, see below) in the form of the deceased’s best horse, ox or cow, see my ‘Colla Ciotach’, TGSI 48 (1972–74), pp. 201–43: 215, 217. It is comprehensively defined by Dwelly under bó-ursainn, colpach, damh-ursainn, each-fuinn and each-ursainn; see also Sgiathanach [the Rev. Alexander MacGregor], ‘A Remarkable Feudal Custom’, The Celtic Magazine, vol. 1 (1875–76), pp. 119–21; J. G. Mackay, ‘Social Life in Skye from Legend and Story. Part II’, TGSI 29 (1914–19), pp. 335–54: 338–42; and, for Ireland, Kenneth Nicholls, Gaelic and Gaelicised Ireland in the Middle Ages (Dublin, 1972), pp. 32, 186. We may understand ursann (‘door-post’) as signifying not the animal nearest the door, as has been suggested, but the one which best supported the household, cf. ursann catha ‘a pillar of battle’, i.e. hero.

53–56 This refers to the abuse of heritable jurisdictions (the so-called ‘right of pit and gallows’) until their abolition in 1748 following the Jacobite rebellion. (In this one respect, the poem is a reply to the Jacobites.) To illustrate the point, MacRae cites some of the many local traditions provided in the Rev. W. Forsyth’s In the Shadow of Cairngorm (Inverness, 1900), pp. 138–48. For example, a bailie of regality called Robert Grant, am Bàillidh Mór (‘the Big Bailie’), was said to have hanged people for declining to oblige him, and seldom called juries; he hanged two brothers on a tree, and buried both in one grave at

[TD 507]

the roadside. James Grant, am Bàillidh Ruadh (‘the Red Bailie’), who lived in the parish of Abernethy, once hanged two notorious thieves, parboiled their heads and set them up on spikes. On another occasion he drowned two men in sacks at the bridge of Billimon. On yet another he hanged a man called Stewart, then appointed a jury who found him guilty; Stewart’s cattle, horses, sheep and goats were driven to the bailie’s home, while his children went begging, and his widow became mentally deranged and was found drowned in the Spey. This seems to have happened within our poet’s lifetime. Finally, Am Bàillidh Bàn (‘the White Bailie’) made himself so odious that the people drowned him in the Spey near the church of Inverallan, after first taking off his boots and gloves and leaving them on the bank. They drove his horse into a rocky place by the river to make it seem like an accident, but the boots and gloves on the bank and the tracks in the sand revealed what had really happened. When a man met a search party looking for his body down by the church of Cromdale he said, “Turn back, turn back, perhaps he has gone up against the river, for he was always acting against nature.”

81–88 It sounds as if the poet is addressing a particular individual here, but I have no idea who it might be. I certainly do not think it is James Macpherson (poem 59).


57. An t-Òran Eile

For William Ross see poem 55. He is regarded as the outstanding Gaelic love poet of the eighteenth century. This has yet to be tested through a collection of eighteenth-century Gaelic love-songs, but it appears to have been the opinion of the greatest Gaelic love poet of the twentieth century, Sorley MacLean (1911–96), who took inspiration from Ross’s plight, see Dàin do Eimhir (Glasgow, 1943), pp. 31, 99:

<gai>
Uilleim Rois, dé chanamaid
ag coinneachadh taobh thall a’ bhàis?
Dhèanainn luaidh air t’ Òran Eile.
<eng>

(“William Ross, what should we say / meeting beyond death? / I should mention your Oran Eile.”)

In 1786 Ross returned to Gairloch as parish schoolmaster, and he appears to have held that post until his last illness in 1790. The opening stanza of our poem may perhaps describe the advanced tubercular condition – infected lungs and intolerance to alcohol. Even so, he remains a love poet above all: it is not his càil, his physical consciousness, which troubles him, but his aigne, his spiritual consciousness. We should also note the prominence given to Marion’s voice in the poem, rather than to any other aspect of her being: his relationship with her

[TD 508]

has not been a physical one, and indeed the girl he regrets not seeing is one simply walking along the street. He is, nevertheless, mar fhear nach toir spéis do mhnaoi: he feels guilty of having enjoyed the company of other women, considers himself unfaithful to her memory, and has forfeited the right to join her in immortality. Indeed, in this exquisite poem he is being borne along on a wave-crest of passionate despair which cannot break. He moves rapidly through images at a violent pace and reaches his climax in only six stanzas. It is one of the best-chiselled poems in the Gaelic language; MacLean was overwhelmed by it. “The strange thing about it to me,” he wrote, “is that such a perfection of self-conscious technique should accompany such poignancy of emotion,” and he goes on to mention as a parallel the pìobaireachd ‘Cumha na Cloinne’, see William Gillies (ed.), Ris a’ Bhruthaich: The Criticism and Prose Writings of Sorley MacLean (Stornoway, 1985), p. 38. The self-consciousness of technique is best seen in the poet’s alliterations and in his punning on bréid (‘sail’ and ‘marriage kerchief’, line 19), on dàn (‘fate’ and ‘poem’, line 28), on màl and màileid (lines 29–30) and on gearrain and ghearrainn (lines 31–32).

I take the song from pp. 171–74 of Mackenzie’s 1834 edition of Ross’s poems. It is also to be found in SO 297 and at pp. 172–75 of Calder’s edition, where it is entitled ‘Oran Eile, air an Aobhar Cheudna’ (‘Another Song, on the Same Theme’).

17 See poem 8, note on line 76.

27 I was assured by the late Rev. William Matheson that the syntax of this line is acceptable, cf. poem 32, note on line 39. The 1868 edition emended to A’ cantainn nach eil annam ach bàrd (same meaning), but this was not followed by Calder.


58. Aoir do dh’Alastair Mac an Tòisich

Kenneth MacKenzie (see poem 54) returned from the sea in 1789, the year of the French Revolution, and started going around his native district taking subscriptions to enable him to publish his poems. What happened next is best told in the words of John Mackenzie (SO 270–71):

Having called upon Alexander McIntosh, of Cantray Down, he not only refused him his subscription, but gruffly ordered him to be gone from his door! Certainly a polite refusal would have cost the high-souled gentleman as little as this rebuff, and apologies of a tolerably feasible nature can now be found for almost every failing. Our bard, thus unworthily insulted, retaliates in a satire of great merit. In this cynic production he pours forth periods of fire; it is an impetuous torrent of bitter irony and withering declamation, rich in the essential ingredients of its kind; and McIntosh, who does not appear to have been impenetrable to the arrows of remorse, died, three days after the published satire was in his possession. (This happened in the year

[TD 509]

1792, in which our author published.)

Distressed at this mournful occurrence, which he well knew the superstition and gossip of his country would father upon him, McKenzie went again among his subscribers, recalled the books from such as could be prevailed upon to give them up, and consigned them to the flames: a sufficient indication of his sorrow for his unmerciful, and, as he thought, fatal castigation of McIntosh. This accounts for the scarcity of his books.


Kenneth MacKenzie spent the rest of his life well away from Castle Leather and Cantray Down. Thanks to the influence of Lord Seaforth and the Earl of Buchan he obtained a commission in the 78th Highlanders, and on leaving the army he became postmaster of an Irish provincial town (SO 271). Some letters written by him from Fermoy, Co. Cork, in 1818 to his brother James at 26 Castle Street, Inverness, may be found in NLS MS 14883 (Duncan Campbell, formerly Acc. 2140), ff. 235–38. John Mackenzie adds:

He indulged in the genuine hospitality of his heart, always keeping an open door and spread table, and literally caressing such of his countrymen as chance or business led in his way. We have conversed with an old veteran who partook of his liberality so late as the year 1837.


The words ‘literally caressing’ can only, I think, mean that the poet was understood to be homosexual; see also note on lines 37–40 below. Is it fanciful to suggest that the real reason for this extraordinary poem is Macintosh’s spurning of our sailor’s sexual advances, perhaps a full-scale lovers’ quarrel?

At any rate, smarting as he obviously was from naval discipline, Kenneth MacKenzie’s satire is so strong that we can almost feel the lash upon our backs as we read it. It appears in his book under the title ‘Aoir do dh’Alastair Mac an Tòisich ann an Canntra Dùn, air son e bhith ’na dhroch òlach’, which we might translate ‘A satire on Alexander Macintosh in Cantray Down, for being a bad husbandman’ (see note on line 74), but the poet moves rapidly from criticism of his husbandry to criticism of his hospitality.

I take the poem from the infamous book, Òrain Ghaidhealach (Edinburgh, 1792), pp. 174–81. I should add that despite John Mackenzie’s reference to its scarcity, it is not a particularly rare book at all. At p. 126 of their Scottish Gaelic Union Catalogue (Edinburgh, 1984), Mary Ferguson and Ann Matheson list surviving copies of it in the Mitchell Library, Inverness Public Library, the Free Church College, Trinity College, Baillie’s Library, the library of An Comunn Gaidhealach, the university libraries of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, St Andrews and Cambridge, Edinburgh Central Library, the National Library of Scotland, the Signet Library, the British Library, the National Library of Wales, and the West Highland Museum. I also know of one in private hands, which makes seventeen in all. For a Gaelic book of its time, that is a lot.

11 Kenneth MacKenzie explains in a footnote: “When the Author was going about taking in subscriptions, coming to Cantry Down about dinner-time, he thought that he would not be allowed to go away hungry; but he soon found it otherwise: for when Mr McIntosh came to the door, he not only denied him his subscription, but desired him to go away from his house.”

17–20 For rodent satires see notes on poem 40.

20 In the Gaelic oral tradition, given that poetry was sung, poets were effectively musicians, cf. poem 43, line 39.

21–24 The implication appears to be that the poetic profession has the backing of otherworld powers, a theme maintained in lines 25–32. This is strengthened by the use of the archaic term filidh (‘professional poet’) in addition to the more ordinary bàrd.

22 The author appends a footnote: “A cascade, called Fall of Fires, where all the waters on the west side of Stratheric meet together, and, running through a narrow passage, between rocks, from a considerable height, form a cascade, the waters of which, by the vast height from which they fall emit a continual smoke. This natural phenomenon is so very remarkable, that people from all parts of Britain come to view it.”

34 This may be a reference to the long-standing feud between the Macintoshes and the Keppoch MacDonalds, originating in the fact that the Macintoshes possessed feudal rights and hereditary jurisdictions in Lochaber. It culminated at Mulroy in Brae Lochaber in 1688, the last clan battle in the Highlands.

37–40 The basic image is of skinning a wild beast, but there are sadomasochistic undertones. With sound judgement, it is followed at lines 41–48 by a spot of (relatively speaking) comic relief – Macintosh as a tinker on his way to a fair.

49 The rights of fairs were established by ancient custom and enshrined by Acts of Parliament; transgressors were subject to instant trial and punishment by special courts. See my ‘Scottish Fairs and Fair-Names’, Scottish Studies, vol. 33 (1999), pp. 1–75: 8–15.

51 The author explains in a footnote: “A custom formerly among the Romans for punishing offenders, called runing them through the rods. It was done thus: They made two files of 285 men each, facing one another, each with a rod in his hand, with a small interval between them for the offender to run in, every one laying on as he passed.”

53 Perhaps the skatefish torture was one of the poet’s naval experiences.

55 The reference is to a real cat, but memories of the cat o’ nine tails cannot be far from the poet’s mind. For a very relevant account of an eighteenth-century Gael in the Royal Navy see James Shaw Grant’s Morrison of the Bounty (Stornoway, 1998).

61–62 The word ceathramh, here rendered ‘pack’, is properly a firlot

[TD 511]

or bushel, literally a ‘quarter’ – the kind of word one might use in walking into a butcher’s shop. A more graphic translation might be: “Your pound of sausages would be plucked out, which so often filled up with greed.” This leads to another butchering image at lines 63–64, in which the word the poet uses for ‘struck’ is actually spadadh – ‘slaughtered’.

69 By spiocaid the poet can hardly mean a spigot. He may mean a ‘picket’, in the sense of the old military punishment of standing on one foot on a pointed stake; or perhaps, given the contortions described in lines 71–72, he is referring to Macintosh’s body being roasted on a spit. Near Beauly in Inverness-shire was a spot referred to in a seventeenth-century source as the ‘spiggadach’, which I take to represent Gaelic spiogadach, ‘picketing’, a stockade or other area fenced off with wooden stakes; it appears to have had an ancient stone cross in it (‘Scottish Fairs and Fair-Names’, p. 12).

74 The term òlach (‘hospitable person’, ‘landlord’, ‘host’, ‘farmer’) is from of òl (‘drink’), and appears to have been fashionable at this period. It is in the title Kenneth MacKenzie gave to the poem, and was also much used by Lachlan MacPherson (see poem 40). Since sgamhan is literally a lung, an alternative translation might be: ‘You unpopular lung of a host’.

82 See my article ‘What Does a Water-Horse Look Like?’, WHFP, 4 June 1999.

89–96 This has an autobiographical ring to it.

98 Unlike honest working people, says MacKenzie, Macintosh never has to sleep in the open. One is reminded of Sir Walter Scott’s story of a Lennox herdsman who slept outside one night with Rob Roy’s men. Having no plaid of his own, he crept under that of Rob Roy’s lieutenant, and gradually appropriated more of it than he should. In the morning the man’s head, neck and shoulders were covered in hoar frost, but when he woke up he merely shook himself and rubbed the frost off with his plaid, ‘muttering something of a cauld neight’. See Rob Roy (1893 edn, London), p. lxxii.

123 The author glosses cas-ròp’ in a footnote: “Stirrups made of hair, which the ancient Caledonians used when riding.”

125 The author glosses eillbhuinn in a footnote: “Just as if a person put his feet on a hot coal at the fire-side he would jump and dance as long as his sole kept the heat.” In other words this old mare is like a cat on a hot tin roof, and the fate Kenneth has in mind for Macintosh is similar to that of people carried off to the otherworld by a water-horse, their lungs bobbing to the surface in the morning.

131–36 The reference is to a ‘lifting’ by the sluagh or fairy host, see John Gregorson Campbell, Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (Glasgow, 1900), pp. 68–72.

[TD 512]

137 The reference is to this saying, for which see Alexander Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1882), p. 192:

’S gaoth nan long a’ dol fo sheòl —

59. Cumha Sheumais Bhàin

Duncan MacKay (Donnchadh Gobha, c. 1730 – c. 1825) lived at Ardbroileach in Badenoch and was an elder in the kirk session of Kingussie. He is also the author of a eulogy to Ewan MacPherson of Cluny, for whom see poem 47 (Turner’s collection of 1813, pp. 268–71, and Sinton’s Poetry of Badenoch, pp. 77–82, 400–03).

Duncan MacKay appears to be the best representative in this anthology of the type of person known as na Daoine, ‘the Men’, commonly defined as lay guardians of evangelical presbyterianism, powerful in prayer, venerated for their piety and often possessed of the twin gifts of prophecy and of poetry, whose practice was to wander the country speaking to the question at fellowship meetings, supporting godly ministers, and opposing laxity in all its forms. Although the work of John MacKay of Mudale (for whom see poem 29) was published in a book entitled Metrical Reliques of ‘The Men’ in the Highlands, Mudale, as a tacksman, was in a position to communicate spiritual values through the advantages of formal education and secular leadership of his community. As a schoolmaster, the same applies to Dugald Buchanan (poem 45), while of David MacKellar (poem 25) we know very little.

The subject of our elegy, James (“Ossian”) Macpherson (1736–96), universally known in his native Badenoch as Seumas Bàn (‘Fairhaired James’), was a son of Andrew MacPherson of Invertromie. As a boy of nine he witnessed the traumatic events following Culloden when, the MacPhersons having fought for Prince Charles (see poem 47), the district was pillaged and brutalised by the British Army. Being a tacksman’s son, he received the advantages of a formal education in English as well as the Gaelic education of the ceilidh-house. At Aberdeen University he was taught by Thomas Blackwell, whose theory of literature exalted the ‘sublime’ and found it above all in such epics of the past as the works of Homer (see p. 470 above).

In 1759, while employed as a tutor in the family of Lord Lynedoch, a chance encounter with the literary men of Edinburgh set Macpherson on the trail that led to the publication of his Fragments of Ancient Poetry Collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and Translated from the Gaelic or

[TD 513]

Erse Language (1760), Fingal: An Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books (1762), and Temora: An Epic Poem in Eight Books (1763). To produce these remarkable works, all of which were ascribed to Ossian but bore his own name as translator, he travelled as far as Uist and collected manuscripts, including, for example, both of those used as the source for our poem 18. Then he enlisted the help of friends and relatives such as Lachlan MacPherson of Strathmashie (see poem 40) to produce texts which represented the genuine Ossianic tales and ballads of his youth (see poem 17) as faithfully as possible while providing the literati with something of the primitive-sounding romance which they so ardently desired.

These publications met with instant success far beyond the bounds of Scotland and were translated into many languages. The cult of Ossian lasted for a century, but so did the controversy. Macpherson could not exactly produce his ‘originals’, because they did not exactly exist. Being by training a scholar of English rather than of Gaelic literature, he had given up puzzling over indecipherable manuscripts and listening to untranslatable old men, and simply concocted his epic out of a buzz of impressions in his own head. The work was thus a faithful amalgam of the University of Aberdeen and the ceilidh-house of Invertromie. What is more, as Fiona Stafford has pointed out at p. ix of her perceptive introductory essay to the 1996 Poems of Ossian, between the ages of 10 and 18 Macpherson had lived through scenes of appalling violence, followed by measures of unprecedented ferocity against the culture and way of life of his people. Gaelic speakers of Macpherson’s day felt that their possession of the language gave them authority to deduce what the nature of the original epic would have been. After Culloden, all the Gael had left was his language, even his clothing having been torn from him (see poem 35). Was young Seumas Bàn not now to be allowed even to make judgements about his own tradition?

For a century and more, while modernism reigned supreme, his work was deeply unfashionable, but once again we have a slew of books on the subject: Fiona Stafford, The Sublime Savage: James Macpherson and the Poems of Ossian (Edinburgh, 1988); Howard Gaskill (ed.), Ossian Revisited (Edinburgh, 1991); Howard Gaskill (ed.), The Poems of Ossian and Related Works (Edinburgh, 1996); Fiona Stafford and Howard Gaskill (eds), From Gaelic to Romantic: Ossianic Translations (Amsterdam, 1998); and so on.

Enjoying the wealth and fame which Ossian had brought him, Macpherson put controversy behind him, and embarked upon a successful career as historian, man of business and politician. In 1775 he published a History of Great Britain from the Restoration till the Accession of George I, and he served as MP for Camelford in Cornwall from 1780 to 1786. Throughout his life in London, however, he displayed intense loyalty to his own people, and it was mainly thanks to his exertions that the Cluny estates were restored in 1784 to the son of

[TD 514]

Ewan MacPherson. He was an important member of a growing Gaelic-speaking ‘mafia’ in London, and made much use of Gaelic as a private language in correspondence with his friend Sir John Macpherson, Governor-General of India (a Skye Macpherson), regularly referring to Warren Hastings, for example, as Fear na Cabhaig (‘the Man of Haste’), see James N. M. Maclean, ‘The Early Political Careers of James “Fingal” Macpherson (1736–96) and Sir John Macpherson, Bart. (1744–1821)’, PhD, Edinburgh, 1967. In due course he bought three estates in Badenoch and commissioned Robert Adam to build him a house in a spot overlooking his birthplace called Balavil or Belleville (Bail’ a’ Bhile, ‘the Township of the Sacred Tree’). Towards the end of his life he went to live there annually in the autumn. Being affable, easy-going, generous and hospitable, he was popular in the district, and of course his estates provided much-needed employment (see line 171).

Thomas Sinton tells us that during his last illness James Macpherson ‘delighted in the society of the “Men”, whom he sent for and invited to engage in religious conversation and prayer’. Macpherson’s neighbour, Mrs Grant of Laggan, does not corroborate this in her account of his last days.

He was a very good-natured man; and now that he had got all his schemes of interest and ambition fulfilled, he seemed to reflect and grow domestic, and showed of late a great inclination to be an indulgent landlord and very liberal to the poor; of which I could relate various instances more tender and interesting than flashy and ostentatious. His heart and temper were originally good. His religious principles were, I fear, unfixed and fluctuating; but the primary cause that so much genius, taste, benevolence, and prosperity did not produce or diffuse more happiness, was his living a stranger to the comforts of domestic life, from which unhappy connections excluded him … It pleased the Almighty to render his last scene most affecting and exemplary. He died last Tuesday evening; and from the minute he was confined to a very little before he expired, never ceased imploring the Divine mercy in the most earnest and pathetic manner.


At any rate, one of the ‘Men’ whom Sinton claims to have been summoned was MacKay, this pious blacksmith whom he had known all his life (he appears, judging from line 99, to have witnessed Macpherson’s baptism in 1736). Given this context, our elegy is all the more interesting for being on a secular subject. I can think of few other Gaelic poems which convey a sense of culture clash so strong that the poet is left struggling for words. The best parallel I can think of is from 200 years before, when a MacGregor woman described a gun as fùdar caol neimhe (‘a slender powder of poison’) rather as if it were a species of snake (BGh 243). At lines 67–68, for example, MacKay speaks of ‘playing’ on a floor that is ‘scoured’ with ‘soap’; the interpretation of this as dancing on a deal floor polished with French chalk (soapstone) is my own. Again, at lines 93–94 one has the feeling that the poet is having to come to terms for the first time in his life with art in the form

[TD 515]

of sculpture and painting, and feels forced to concede that it has moral value. Finally, at lines 121–36 the dichotomy is an exclusively moral one. After indentifying incontinence as Macpherson’s only sin and accepting that he has repented, MacKay seems unable to stop himself seeing his subject through his women’s eyes, and his description of them as sneachd na h-aon oidhche – ‘one night of snowfall’ – is sympathetically erotic.

A lifelong bachelor, James Macpherson fathered five children – all of whom appear to have been brought up in England – by different women, one of whom was Elizabeth Draper, to whom Laurence Sterne addressed his ‘Journal to Eliza’, see Thomas Keymer, ‘Narratives of Loss’, in Stafford and Gaskill (eds), From Gaelic to Romantic (Amsterdam, 1998), pp. 79–96: 84. Says his biographer Bailey Saunders, The Life and Letters of James Macpherson (London, 1894), p. 297:

To give the names of their mothers would now serve no useful purpose whatever; but it is to be set down to his credit that, unlike some more distinguished men, he made ample provision for all his children, and settled on their several mothers a comfortable annuity … There were three sons and two daughters. Of the sons, the eldest, James, became before his father’s death a lieutenant in the East India Company’s service, and he succeeded to the estates; the second, Charles, educated at Hampstead, died early in India; of the third, born in 1783, the name is not known. His daughters were Ann, who succeeded James in the estates, and died childless; and Juliet, who was brought up in a boarding school at Putney. In 1810 Juliet married Mr., afterwards Sir David Brewster; and his descendants took the name Macpherson.


Macpherson died at Belleville on 17 February 1796, leaving a sum of money in his will for the erection of a monument to himself on his own land. This may still be seen at Kingussie. He directed that his corpse be enclosed in three coffins – first one of Glen Feshie fir, with one of lead in the middle, and one of mahogany on the outside – before being brought south for burial in Westminster Abbey (see lines 86, 151, 157). “This token of the importance to which Seumas Ban attained made a great impression in the country,” says Sinton (p. 265), “and used to be often alluded to in my own recollection.” Saunders (pp. 301–02) takes up the story:

In a codicil he directed, after a practice permissible at the time, that his remains should be carried in the most decent manner from Scotland to the Abbey of Westminster; for that, he wrote, was ‘the city wherein I lived and passed the greatest and best part of my life’. His body was brought to London. At Highgate, after being eighteen days on the road, it was met by many of his friends, and a long row of carriages followed it to the Abbey. On 15th March it was buried in the south transept, not far from Poets’ Corner. A plain inscription marks the grave.


I take the poem from Thomas Sinton (ed.), The Poetry of Badenoch

[TD 516]

(Inverness, 1906), pp. 260–68. Sinton’s extremely literal translation at pp. 505–08 was helpful in places.

8 ‘Witchcraft’ may seem a little strong for rosad, especially in view of my ‘unlucky’ for rosadach at poem 4, line 49, but the `Men’ did not believe in luck.

11 The reference is to the leprous Syrian general Naaman, who was outraged that the prophet Elisha (Elijah, Elias) would not come to cure him in person (2 Kings 5: 1–14).

24 According to Sinton (The Poetry of Badenoch, p. 263), Macpherson, who was exceedingly kind to the poor people on his estate, used to say to them: Mo thruaigh sibh dar thig an Sasannach – “I fear for you when the Englishman comes.” He was referring to the succession of his own son and heir, Lt. James Macpherson of the East India Company. “What he feared took place, when, within a few years, one hundred and fifty families were driven from their homes.”

39 A ‘frank’ was the superscribed signature of a person, e.g. a member of parliament, entitled to send letters free. Postage was a state monopoly.

45 A reference to Macpherson’s will, Public Record Office, London, Prob. 11/1272 137.

48 Eurla (‘Earl’) will be a reference to God, more commonly described as Rìgh (‘King’).

50 The word for bait, maorach, means ‘shellfish’. Shellfish was regarded with disgust by the people of the West Highlands and Islands as being fit only for the starving and destitute. Presumably bait of other kinds, such as worms, is meant here, since Badenoch is far from the sea, but the poet’s rabbinical abhorrence of maorach is noteworthy.

61 This will be a reference to communion, employing Macpherson’s secular lifestyle as an extended metaphor.

72 The expression fear aogais (‘the man of his countenance, appearance or likeness’), is distinctively Gaelic. It means ‘the man himself, particularly with respect to his countenance, appearance or likeness’, cf. line 160 fear ainm (‘the man of his name’).

73 Sinton remarks (p. 264) that ‘Macpherson had inherited in no small degree the hereditary good looks of the Macphersons of Nuide’.

115 Sinton remarks (p. 266) that bands of reapers were probably in the habit of crossing the Firth of Forth at Kinghorn when travelling between the Highlands and East Lothian.

143–44 I disagree with Sinton, who translates ‘I will yet give a turn to the circle of the wheel’ and suggests (p. 508) that the poet means he will invoke the Muses in honour of the heir. It is surely one of the most popular metaphors in Gaelic verse, the

[TD 517]

wheel of fortune (see p. 527, item 9.3), and the poet simply means he is giving the heir the benefit of the doubt.

145–46 Cf. poem 13, lines 2–3, and poem 18, lines 97–98.


60. Bantrach an Duine Bheò

Allan MacDougall (Ailean Dall, c. 1750 – 1828) was born in Glencoe. He became a tailor’s apprentice – effectively an apprenticeship to poetry, because, says John Mackenzie (SO 298):

The excursive nature of this occupation, accorded well with Allan’s disposition – the house in which they wrought, was literally crammed every night with young and old, who passed the time in reciting old legends – tales of love, of war, of the chase – intermingled occasionally with songs and recitations of ancient poetry.


Mackenzie then tells a tall tale of how the poet lost his sight, which need not detain us here. His blindness, whatever its cause, left him dependent on charity. In 1790 he and his family were given a house and a little land by a benefactor in Inverlochy. His songs becoming popular in the district, he sought the help of a young tutor called Ewen MacLachlan (for whom see poem 61) to write them down. They were published in Edinburgh in 1798, with a supplement containing MacLachlan’s own poems, as Orain Ghaidhealacha: le Ailein Dughallach, fear ciuil ann an Ionbhar Lochaidh. Maille ri Co’-Chruinneachadh Oran is Dhan, le Ughdairibh Eile.

Among the poems in this 1798 volume (pp. 36–40) was MacDougall’s most important work, ‘Do na Cìobairean Gallda’ (‘To the Lowland Shepherds’). I have chosen not to include it in the present collection, as it has recently been edited twice – by Hugh Cheape, in ‘A Song on the Lowland Shepherds: Popular Reaction to the Highland Clearances’, Scottish Economic and Social History, vol. 15 (1995), pp. 85–100, and by Donald Meek, in Tuath is Tighearna: Tenants and Landlords (SGTS, Edinburgh, 1995), pp. 47–53, 186–89. In graphic terms, it expresses revulsion at the invasion of the Highlands by huge numbers of sheep and their even more alien flockmasters – a development which had already begun to empty the land of its people and to destroy the only language and literature which Allan knew. (Compare the sense of rage and bewilderment at this development expressed by John MacCodrum, poem 52, lines 49–64.)

Both Blind Allan and Ewen MacLachlan now fell under the patronage of one of the greatest hypocrites of this hypocritical era, Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, who was busy raising his people’s rents to levels which they could not afford while ostentatiously strutting the part of an old-style Highland chieftain – a guise in which he was famously painted by Sir Henry Raeburn. It proved a mixed blessing for MacLachlan, but an unmixed one for MacDougall, who acted out the role of the blind bard with enormous enthusiasm for the rest of his life.

[TD 518]

He died in the same year as his patron, when a second and much expanded edition of his work – without the MacLachlan supplement – was already in the press in Inverness. It duly appeared in 1829 as Ailein Dughalach, Orain, Marbhrannan, agus Duanagan, Ghaidhealach.

I take our poem from the 1798 edition, pp. 65–66, where it is entitled ‘Oran Do Cheilidh Nuadh phoisde, air dhith dol air thurus. Air fonn, “Gur grad am bruadar, &c.”’ (‘A Song To his Newly-married Spouse, when she had gone on a journey. To the air, “Gur grad am bruadar, &c.”’) It appears in the 1829 edition at pp. 55–56. I take my title from line 24.

61. An t-Earrach

Ewen MacLachlan (1773–1822), from Coruanan in Lochaber, was the most learned of the eighteenth-century Gaelic poets. Had he not been of a retiring and nervous disposition, he might have been the first Professor of Celtic in any university; as it was, plans to create a Chair of Celtic for him in Edinburgh University were laid aside in 1812. He spent his working life in Aberdeen, where he was librarian of King’s College and successively master of the Parochial School and the Grammar School. His work-rate was prodigious, and his enormous talents were much exploited by the Scottish academic and literary communities of his day. He is the founding father of Scottish Gaelic palaeography and lexicography, having reported in detail on the Highland Society of Scotland’s collection of medieval Gaelic manuscripts and laid the groundwork for its magisterial dictionary of the language, which was ultimately published in 1828. As if this were not enough, he translated most of the ‘Iliad’ into Gaelic and was also the author of many songs and poems, of which ‘Gur Gile mo Leannan’ (‘Whiter is my Sweetheart’) became extremely popular. Fourteen of his Gaelic poems (and translations), including the present one, were published under the heading ‘Dain le E. McL.’ at pp. 109–75 of MacDougall’s collection of 1798. His Attempts in Verse of 1807 and Metrical Effusions of 1816 include original verse in Latin, Greek, English and Gaelic; a number of his poems, including the present one (at pp. 44–50), were reprinted in MacFarlane’s collection of 1813.

MacLachlan was not a great Gaelic poet but a technically very competent one. His greatest claim to literary fame probably lies in his poems to the seasons. Mac Mhaighstir Alastair made songs to both summer and winter, Donnchadh Bàn and William Ross to summer only, Rob Donn and Dugald Buchanan to winter only, but MacLachlan – and yes, it is all rather revealing about the respective temperaments of these six major figures – MacLachlan made songs to spring, summer, autumn and winter.

Of various articles relating to MacLachlan, the most recent is my own ‘The Gaelic Academy: The Cultural Commitment of the Highland Society of Scotland’, Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 14, part 2 (1986), pp. 1–38, and vol. 15, part 1 (1988), pp. 103–21. For his poetry see John MacDonald (ed.), Ewen MacLachlan’s Gaelic Verse (Aberdeen, 1937), and for some of his letters see Rev. John Sinclair, ‘Some Letters from the Pen of Ewen MacLachlan, Old Aberdeen’, TGSI 16 (1890), pp. 122–48, and Derick S. Thomson, ‘Unpublished Letters by the Poet Ewen MacLachlan’, Scottish Gaelic Studies, vol. 11 (1968), pp. 202–36. Many more of his letters and other manuscripts lie in the archives of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society at Ingliston and in the National Library of Scotland.

I take the poem from Ewen MacLachlan’s Gaelic Verse, pp. 221–26. It appears in MacDougall’s collection of 1798 at pp. 130–37.

60, 64 In terms of the traditional Gaelic calendar, spring consists of the calendar months of February, March and April. However, following the Calendar Act of 1751, which belatedly dropped eleven days to bring the United Kingdom into line with the Gregorian calendar, the Highland spring was regarded as lasting from 12 February to 11 May. Màigh is certainly the calendar month of May, but at this period an céitein, which I like to translate ‘maytime’, is better understood in its older sense as a period of inbetweenness that extended a fortnight or so on either side of the summer quarter-day, i.e. 12 May. The first half was called an céitein earraich (‘the spring maytime’) and the second half an céitein samhraidh (‘the summer maytime’). See also line 185.

89–96 In 1798, the year in which our poem was published, there were estimated to be 800 goats in Moidart and 1,500 in Arisaig and South Morar. In his summary of the Statistical Accounts of the 1790s, Sir John Sinclair observed that ‘in the Highlands of Scotland, there were formerly more goats than sheep’. The elimination of goats – and thus of the servile caste of landless cottars whom they sustained – from the Highland economy began in the mid-eighteenth century, encouraged first by efforts to conserve forests, then by the new emphasis on sheep, and finally by clearance (B. R. S. Megaw, ‘Goat-Keeping in the Old Highland Economy’, Scottish Studies, vol. 7 (1963), pp. 201–08: 204, 208). In Arran by 1768 there were 12,000 or 13,000 sheep but only 200 goats – ‘clear indication of the progress already achieved by the improving landlords’ (B. R. S. Megaw, ‘Goat-Keeping in the Old Highland Economy – 2’, Scottish Studies, vol. 8 (1964), pp. 213–18: 215).

113 The word gnàthaichte, ‘customary’, has great resonance. The application of ‘custom’ in the kind of joint-tenancy farming (‘run-rig’) that the poet is describing represented the com-

[TD 520]

bined memory, understanding and will required by up to eighteen sub-tenants to determine the proper time for a co-operative work such as ploughing.

116 “The ridges – each alternate ridge having a different tenant – were usually 20 feet wide, and often as wide as 40 feet, crooked like a prolonged S, and very high. Only the crown of the rig, which was full of stones, was ploughed, and half the width of the ridges and the ground between them were taken up with huge ‘baulks’ or open spaces filled with briars, nettles, stones, and water.” Henry Grey Graham, The Social Life of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century (1906 edn, London), p. 157.

118 See I. Whitaker, ‘The Harrow in Scotland’, Scottish Studies, vol. 2 (1958), pp. 149–65, and ‘Some North Uist Harrows’, Scottish Studies, vol. 3 (1959), pp. 106–08.

121 The cultivation of potatoes in the open field became widespread in Scotland during the three decades from 1743, when the practice was introduced in South Uist by Clanranald. Prior to that they were an exotic item in gentlemen’s gardens. As the prominence given to them in this poem suggests, they were already basic to the Highland diet by the 1790s. It is noticeable that ploughing is not even mentioned in connection with the grain crop, which suggests that by now the main ploughing was to prepare the ground for potatoes.

145 It was traditional in the Highlands and Islands to plough with four small horses yoked abreast. During the eighteenth century, however, technological improvements in the form of an iron ristle or sock, which gave extra cutting power and are said to have been introduced to Scotland by the geologist James Hutton (1726–97), permitted the widespread use of the kind of two-horse plough with swingle-tree described here by MacLachlan. The furrow made by such ploughs was rather serpentine, as the stubborn little four-foot instrument veered to one side and another as the plough-team got ready for the next turn. See Graham, The Social Life of Scotland in the Eighteenth Century, p. 204; Dwelly s.vv. acfhuinn and amall; R. Jirlow and I. Whitaker, ‘The Plough in Scotland’, Scottish Studies, vol. 1 (1957), pp. 71–94; I. F. Grant, Highland Folk Ways (London, 1961), p. 101.

165–68 The terms faoilleach (‘wolftime’), feadag (‘whistler’), sguabag (‘sweeper’), gearran (‘cutter’) and cailleach (‘hag’) are wind-names which feature in many traditional rhymes once used to determine the proper time for each item of spring labour, cf. line 113 above. The cailleach is mythologically complex, one of its derivatives being the Cailleach Béara of Irish tradition, hence MacLachlan’s choice of the epithet beurra ‘shrill’. These and other Gaelic terms may be added to the 434 wind names from all over the world listed in Lyall Watson, Heaven’s Breath: A

Corporal Alexander MacKinnon (1770–1814) was born in Morar. He enlisted in the 92nd Regiment (the Gordon Highlanders) when it was raised in 1794. Its first commander was George, Marquis of Huntly, Morair Hunndaidh (see lines 18 and 125). On 11 August 1799 it embarked at Ramsgate for the Helder as part of an expedition against the French in Holland. Due to stormy weather, no landing was made till 27 August, when Helder Point was taken. Says Col. David Stewart of Garth, in Sketches of the Highlanders of Scotland, vol. 2 (2nd edn, Edinburgh, 1822, repr. Edinburgh, 1977), p. 225:

No opposition was made to the landing, but the troops had scarcely formed on a ridge of sand hills, at a short distance from the beach, when the enemy made an attack, and persevered in it till five o’clock in the evening, when they retired, after a hard contest. The 92nd, which formed part of Major-General Moore’s brigade, was not engaged; but in the great action of the 2nd of October it had an active share, and displayed conduct so much to the satisfaction of General Moore, that, when he was made a Knight of the Bath, and obtained a grant of

[TD 522]

supporters for his armorial bearings, he took a soldier of the Gordon Highlanders, in full uniform, as one of these supporters, and a lion as the other.


The ‘great action of the 2nd of October’ was the battle of Egmont. It is thus described by Loraine Maclean, Indomitable Colonel (London, 1986), pp. 154–55:

The 79th, their grenadier company in front, were leading the charge, not without casualties. The first officer to be killed in action was Captain James Campbell of Duntroon. ‘A perfect model of one of the heroes described by Ossian’, he was commanding the leading company and ‘was killed while in the act of waving his sword to encourage his men’. It was the beginning of a long action, lasting nearly five hours, but they pressed on through the sand, with reinforcements joining them from the shore, until at Wimmenum they found, as they had feared, that fresh French troops were waiting for them. Moore had been wounded earlier in the day, though he was still commanding; now he was hit again, this time in the head, and was carried off, but this served to rally the weary men and they advanced again to throw back the French for the last time.


MacKinnon appears to have survived this battle unscathed, but he was severely wounded two years later at Alexandria. He was about to be thrown into a mass grave when his friend, a Sergeant MacLean, discovered that he was still breathing and insisted that he be transferred to a hospital ship. On arrival in England he was discharged with a pension, but as soon as he was able to bear arms again he joined the 6th Royal Veteran Battalion, in which he served for the rest of his life. He died at Fort William in 1814 and was interred with military honours.

For a poem on the Battle of Holland by John MacGregor see that poet’s Orain Ghaelach (Edinburgh, 1801), pp. 203–06. John MacLean printed several of MacKinnon’s songs, along with one by himself in his praise, in Orain Nuadh Ghaedhlach, published in Edinburgh in 1818. These included two pieces on the Battle of Alexandria. The next substantial corpus to appear was in SO, where Mackenzie included MacKinnon’s celebrated song about Macdonald of Glenaladale’s pleasure-boat the Dubh-Ghleannach, see An Tuil, pp. 715 and 743. See also A. Maclean Sinclair’s The Glenbard Collection (Charlottetown, 1890), part 2, pp. 25–39.

I take the song from BGh 25–29. Watson’s sources were Turner’s collection of 1813 (pp. 38–41) and SO 344–46. It is also in Donald MacLeod’s collection of 1811 (pp. 26–31) and Ronald MacDonald’s collection of 1821 (pp. 113–18), lacking only our lines 113–20. MacLeod’s version (the first piece of MacKinnon’s work to be published, three years before his death) is of great interest. It has fifteen stanzas, compared to our sixteen, and is mistakenly headed ‘Oran do Bhlar na h-Eiphaid. Bliadhna 1801’ (‘A Song to the Battle of Egypt. The Year 1801’). It lacks our lines 89–104, but has one stanza not

[TD 523]

present elsewhere. Were I to insert it in our text it would follow line 88.

Sgap iad an-sin as gach àite,

Leigeil stàirneil ás an cuimhne.
Thòisich iad ri losgadh làmhaich
Leis na làidrich chroma chinnteach,
Sgapadh pheileirean ’s gach àite —

<eng>

(“They then dispersed from everywhere, / All taking to each hummock’s shelter / To make a battery from everywhere, / And forget the fearful noise. / They began to fire a volley / With the deadly crooked field-guns, / Scattering bullets everywhere — / Whistling and no source of pleasure.”) This is a weak stanza, given its tedious repetition of gach àite ‘everywhere’. It displays a consistent feature of MacLeod’s version of the song, the flaunting of English military terminology (in this case ‘battery’). Other examples are: Ghluais na Breatannaich on ‘bhanca’ / Gu ‘advance’ thoirt air na naimhdibh (‘The British marched from the bank / To make the enemy advance’, lines 3–4); Bha ’m ‘brigade’ fo mhùiseig dhainginn / Cumail aingil ris na Fraingich (‘The brigade was strongly threatened / Keeping fire upon the French’, lines 7–8); ’Crombie mór na féile (‘Big ’Crombie of generosity’, line 9); a’ danns le ‘music’ (‘dancing musically’, line 22); Dhòirt na Frangaich ’nam brattalion (‘The French poured in their brattalion [sic]’, line 33); Tionnda’ibh boisibh ’s tàirrngibh ‘line’ (‘Turn your palms and draw a line’, line 41); ’S chaidh ‘roll’ gach caiptein éigheachd (‘And every captain’s roll was called’, line 106); Togarrach nuair ghluaiste ‘charge’ (‘Lively when a charge was moved’, line 116); and A ‘g(h)eard’ a bhrataichean o ainneart (‘To guard his banners from attack’, line 128).

This catalogue of loanwords is particularly startling in view of John Mackenzie’s verdict on MacKinnon, after examining some of his manuscripts (no longer extant), that he had ‘studied the Gaelic language to good purpose; few have been able so completely to master its idiom and to soar on the syren wings of poesy, sustaining throughout such a sublime and uncontaminated diction’ (SO 340). It seems that MacLeod – or Dòmhnall nan Òran, as he came to be called – had got hold of a barrack-room version of the song which lacked the poet’s imprimatur. On the other hand, at least one of MacLeod’s anglicisms (admittedly a long-established one, as it can be found in Iain Lom’s poems) has the ring of authenticity:

<gai>
Dh’fhàg iad sinne mar a b’ annsa
Fo chomannda mhorair shunndaich
<eng>

(‘They left us as was preferred / Under the cheerful lord’s command’, lines 17–18.) Chomannda is good rhyme for annsa; cheannardachd is not.

[TD 524]

5 Sir Ralph Abercromby (1734–1801) commanded the first division. If he ‘took the coast’ from the British it was in the figurative sense that his cannonade obscured it from view. As Watson remarks (BGh 265), a witty Skyeman once said of a massive woman, Thug i dhiom an Cuiltheann! “She took the Cuillins from me!” On the other hand, MacLeod’s version has not taobh na mara (‘the sea side’) but cùis na mara (‘the sea affair’). Loraine Maclean explains (Indomitable Colonel, p. 154):

Abercromby’s division was moved from the left to the right wing of the army and the Duke [of York] was up by six o’clock to see them march past and away along the beach and among the dunes to turn the enemy’s left flank. Moore was ordered to detach part of his brigade and he chose two Scottish regiments, the 25th … and the 79th. They ploughed through the soft deep sand of the dunes and had barely taken up their new positions when the French attacked.

27 Lt.-Gen. Sir Alan Cameron of Erracht (1750–1828) raised the 79th Regiment (the Cameron Highlanders) in 1793; see also line 59.

36 MacLeod here has Thuiteadh iad mar ghàradh droma (‘They would fall like a dyke made of turf’).

57 MacLeod here has not Camshronaich but Frisealaich (Frasers).

59 Sir Alan Cameron ‘was shot through the arm early in the action, and later in the day was severely wounded in the wrist, which latter wound deprived him of the use of his arm for the rest of his life’. “His writing,” adds his biographer Loraine Maclean (Indomitable Colonel, p. 155), “was never again the work of art that it had once been.”

61–62 These lines are from a version sung in Harris, as given to Watson by the Rev. Malcolm Maclean, Ferintosh. Turner, Ronald MacDonald and SO give Gu(r) sònraicht’ coltach an dearcag / ’S an fheòil nach taisicheadh fiamh i. I do not understand this, but I do understand MacLeod’s version: Is eòlach a sheòl sibh an dearcag / Air an fheòil nach tais ro’ fhiamhach(d) (‘Well did you aim that little grape / At the flesh that’s not soft from timidity’).
