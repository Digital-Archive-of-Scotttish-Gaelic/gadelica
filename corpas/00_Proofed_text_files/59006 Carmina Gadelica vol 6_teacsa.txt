PREFACE

Of the five volumes of Carmina Gadelica already published we owe two to the collector, Dr Alexander Carmichael, two to his grandson, the late Professor James Carmichael Watson, and one to my brother, the late Professor Angus Matheson. After Professor Matheson’s death the typescript of this sixth and final volume was found among his papers, lacking only a key to abbreviations and list of works referred to. This section has been supplied by me. Thanks are due to Mr Kenneth MacDonald, of the Department of Celtic, Glasgow University, for help with the correction of proofs, a task which has also been lightened by the accuracy of the printers.

ANGUS MATHESON

The publication of Volume VI of Carmina Gadelica brings to a conclusion a notable chapter in the history of Gaelic studies; it does so with a due regard to pietas, and with a fitting sense of form and continuity. Alexander Carmichael’s great contribution as a collector has long been recognised. His daughter Ella married Professor W. J. Watson, and their son, James Carmichael Watson, took up the task of editing his grandfather’s papers, producing Vols. III and IV in a remarkably short time. When James Carmichael Watson died, his Trustees asked the late Professor Angus Matheson to continue the work, as a friend of James’s, and as a student of his father. Angus Matheson saw Vol. V published, and had virtually completed Vol. VI before his death. The trust was then passed to Angus’s brother, who has seen this volume through the press.

It was a privilege to know Angus Matheson, and through him to get to know something of his teachers, in Edinburgh, Dublin and Bonn. Nor should one forget his earlier teachers, in Inverness and in Tarbert (Harris), and the host of men and women whose words and sayings and stories came so readily to his memory. He was a good companion and a doughty protagonist, a little shy in public but confident on his chosen scholarly ground, and always ready to share his knowledge and his views, and to listen to other points of view. His range of reading was very wide, and his natural judgment was good.

As his colleague for seven years, and his successor in the Chair of Celtic at Glasgow, I rejoice to see this stone being laid on his cairn, and on the cairn of that group of Edinburgh scholars whose memory he held dear.

Some years ago a boat was fishing near the island of Troday, off Trotternish in Skye. A few herring lay on the bottom planks. A gannet dived at these with such violence that it drove its

powerful beak to the base through the planks, making a hole which had to be plugged. At one time the gannet was used for food in the Isles. It was customary, old men told me, to sink in the sea a thick board with a herring fixed to its face. The gannet swooped at the herring with such force as to kill itself against the board.

<gai>balg-buill.<eng> Ball bag, the bag in which the witches kept and carried their worsted balls for raising storms. There are many graphic stories told of these witches when they threw out their worsted balls and raised storms and drowned enemies.

Maclean of Duart, like many more men of Mull and Morvern, visited the Spanish ship of war at Tobermory. The Lady of Duart heard that her lord was dallying with the royal princess Viola on board. She sent for her confidante Gormshuil [Gormal] Mhór, who threw out the worsted balls and raised a storm and sank the ship, drowning all aboard save a few favourite friends of the witch.

On each side of the eyes the kerchief is folded neatly and in a becoming manner—a frequent headgear among Uist women, especially at outdoor work. In the early half of the nineteenth century all young women in Uist put up the <gai>beannag<eng> on the morning of their wedding. This was of white linen formed into thin broad bands or hems from the forehead to the crown of the head. It was pretty and becoming. This was the badge of marriage (see bréid). Now the ring on the finger has taken the place of the <gai>beannag<eng> and the matron is not so easily distinguishable from the maidens, at which the girls murmur. [<gai>A’ bheannag bheag<eng>

<gai>beòshlainte.<eng> Living, good or bad. <gai>Is math beòshlaint’ a’ mhanaich, olc no math aig a’ chléireach,<eng> good living has the monk, be it bad or good with the cleric. <gai>Is math beòshlaint’ an t-sagairt ’s gun deò an anam a’ chléirich,<eng> good living has the priest and the breath not in the soul of the cleric. [<gai>cléireach<eng> should here be translated ‘clerk’. Cf. the proverb <gai>‘Cha’n fhiach sagart gun chléireach’.<eng>—A priest is nothing without a clerk. (NGP, 119.) The reference is to the parish clerk, who assisted the priest in some of the latter’s duties. (See further Wigtownshire Charters (S.H.S.), 153 ff.; Essays on the Scottish Reformation, 93-95.) The clerk had custody of the aspersorium (sprinkler) and the amphora for holy water, and his office was often hereditary. (See an instrument, dated 15th July, 1548, appointing as parish clerk of Sanquhar Thomas Clerk, son of Edward Clerk, the previous incumbent.—Wilson, Folklore and Genealogies of Uppermost Nithsdale, 250-251.) Similarly, in Ness, Lewis, when the mentally deranged resorted to <gai>Teampull Mo-lughaidh,<eng> there to be sprinkled with holy water, the stone cup in which it was brought from St Ronan’s Well was in the custody of a family who were descended from ‘the clerk of the temple’ (<gai>cléireach an teampuill<eng>), which suggests that the office had been hereditary (PSAS iv (1863), 268). There are various other sayings apparently referring to the poverty of the clerk in comparison with the priest. <gai>‘Is miann leis a’ chléireach mias mhèith ’bhi aig an t-sagart.’<eng>—A fat dish to the priest is the clerk’s wish. (NGP, 275.) (The reason was perhaps that there would then be some hope of adequate leavings for himself.) <gai>‘Cho fuar ri màthair a’ chléirich.’<eng>—As cold as the beadle’s (recte clerk’s) mother. (NGP, 140, where the explanation given is unconvincing.) A variant (not given

[TD 14]

in NGP) is <gai>‘Cho fuar ri càl a’ chléirich’.<eng>—As cold as the clerk’s kail. (The idea may be that the priest had to be provided for first.) After the Reformation the term <gai>cléireach<eng> continued in use among Protestants in the Highlands in the sense of beadle or church officer.]


<gai>beulaiche, bialaiche, beòlaiche, beulanach, bialanach, beolanach.<eng> A speaker, talker, narrator, newsmonger. <gai>beulum, bialum, beòlum.<eng> A smooth-tongued person, a tale-teller. <gai>beulaireachd.<eng> A contest of wit between two poets. <gai>beulaisg, bialaisg.<eng> Loquacious, open-mouthed [person?].

<gai>bòrlanachd, bòrlandachd, mòrlannachd.<eng> Besides the <gai>càin<eng> of the sheep, the hens and the eggs, the people had to give so many days’ work. This was called <gai>bòrlandachd<eng> or <gai>mòrlannachd,<eng> the whole being termed caraiste or cairiste (q.v.). The latter term, however, denoted the labour exacted from the tenant of the <gai>fear-baile,<eng> tacksman, rather than that exacted by the <gai>tighearna,<eng> lord, laird. The man had to give seven days’ free labour in spring, seven days in autumn, and seven days in summer <gai>air rathad an rìgh,<eng> on the king’s highway. This road labour was exacted from crofters in the Isles and in other remote places although they never saw nor set foot on ‘the king’s highway’ except during the seven days they spent mending it. This labour on the roads, called ‘statute labour’, was converted into a money-tax collected with the other assessments; but on many estates the labour itself continued to be exacted long after the conversion into money had come into force, and the parallel exactions were made simultaneously. Only when the Royal Commission brought these and many other miserable abuses to the light of day did they fall into abeyance.

The last factor in Lewis who exacted these cains was Donald Munro, called <gai>Domhnall Ruadh nan Cearc,<eng> Red Donald of the hens. A satire on him has the lines:

<gai>O gun robh do spiorad fiar
Gu sìorraidh a’ ruith nan cearc!
Agus Domhnall Dubh nam briag
’Gad riasladh air sliabh nam peac!<eng>

Oh may thy crooked soul be in chase of the hens for ever! And Black Donald of the lies (the devil) tearing thee apart on the mountain of sins!

They became known as <gai>Clann-a-Ghéill,<eng> the yielding clan, and <gai>Borr-a-Ghéill,<eng> the projecting yielding mouths. The former gave great offence to the sept, but the latter was insufferable. [This may be a fanciful explanation of an epithet <gai>borra-ghéilleach,<eng> which may come, not from <gai>giall<eng> hostage, but from <gai>giall,<eng> jaw, cheek. <gai>Clann-a-Ghéill<eng> apparently means ‘children of the hostage’ (<gai>giall<eng>).]

<gai>braidean.<eng> A little thief. A woman had been abducted and had a son. When nursing the child she sang a lullaby, the burden of which was that the child would follow the example of his father’s people and harry the kindred of his mother:

[<gai>brionnag<eng> means a deceitful woman. The interpretation of <gai>brionn<eng> as bright is perhaps accounted for by association with <gai>brionngheal,<eng> white-breasted, which however is connected with <gai>brù, broinn,<eng> or <gai>bruinne,<eng> breast. A Lewis example is: <gai>Is mór le brionnag a cuid abhrais,<eng> an uncapable woman loathes the amount of wool she has to work.

The shy badger has his home in a retired gully, burrowed deep into the earth. Like other hibernating animals he grows very fat in the fall of the year, <gai>an t-Sultain.<eng> During the October moon he cuts grass and on a fine moonlight night a cautious spectator may see him turning and drying the grass round about his den. By daylight he has taken it all

[TD 23]

inside. The grass is for warmth in winter and for food. This process is called <gai>am broc a’ caoineachadh a’ bhoitein,<eng> the badger winning or drying his pottle of grass.

At <gai>Sloc an Luaidh,<eng> the gully of the waulking, in Barcaldine, a badger had its den for many years. Hard by were fields under the usual crops—corn, potatoes, etc., and plots of vegetables. The badger helped himself occasionally to the corn, but if carrots were sown he would leave very little of the crop.

<gai>bròn an t-samhraidh.<eng> ‘Sorrow of summer’, means the finest day or the finest period of the summer. It is not now known what day or period is meant.

<gai>brosnachadh bàire, brosnachadh blàir, brosnachadh bualaidh.<eng> An incitement to battle. A boy stretches out his arm and says: <gai>‘Am fear as fìne fuil tilgeadh e smugaid thar a siod’,<eng> ‘He whose blood is most wine-like let him throw a spittle over that’. A boy throws a spittle over the out-stretched arm and in return gets a slap in the mouth from the insulted arm. The fight is on and the two combatants pound away at one another, to the admiration of the other boys. Sometimes the boys are unequally matched and the other boys take sides and the combat becomes general—the wine-blood of the boys flowing freely from cheeks, noses and mouths.

The reference is to cattle-raids made by these chiefs by the light of the moon, generally that of Martinmas or Hallowtide. This was a pastime of chiefs throughout the Highlands, as well as throughout the Borders, for the filling of their larders. It gave rise in the case of the Macfarlanes to the saying <gai>Crò Mhic Phàrlain,<eng> Macfarlane’s cattle-fold, meaning his neighbour’s cattle-fold, and to the famous pibroch <gai>Thogail nam bó.

A girl of South [sic; leg. North] Uist died in Berneray. The weather was so stormy that her body could not be removed across the narrow sea to Uist, and her mother was in great distress. There is a dedication to St Columba at Sand in Uist, sometimes called <gai>Clachan Chaluim Chille,<eng> the Church-town of Columba, and sometimes <gai>Clachan Sannd,<eng> the Church-town of Sand. The mother appealed to Columba, saying:

<gai>A Chaluim Chille an Sannda,
Na leig mo ghaol dh’an Chambar!
Ciùinich féin an t-anntid
Is leig a nall mo ghaol.<eng>

O Columba of Sand, let not my dear one to the Cambar! Calm thou the stormy weather and let hither my beloved.

Columba, who never turned a deaf ear to the distressed, appealed to God, and the storm abated and the girl’s body was laid with the bodies of the fathers in the Clachan of Columba. [Cf. ii. 241.]

A burial place in St Kilda is also called <gai>An Cambar;<eng> its situation is like that of the one in Berneray, above the stormy exposed bay of the island.

<gai>canndal, canndail.<eng> Rushes. These were used in making light chairs, for bedding, for thatching houses, churches or other buildings, and for other purposes. They are still used to strew the floors of houses and churches. The fine imposed by the Church for delinquency included rushes and a contribution to the maintenance of the poor. A certain eccentric cleric raised the penalty, which had the desired effect of stopping delinquency, but also lessened the amount of money for the poor and left the church short of thatch. Through the leaky roof the rain came down upon the cleric’s head as he was officiating in the church, and he exclaimed:

Wert thou to see a sheep or a little flock of sheep in thy sleep, it is angels that would be there. A blessed freedom (redemption?) is to be seen by thee by night or by day, in thy sleeping or in thy waking.’

The sheep is treated with tender care, even its bones being sacred. The native Highland sheep has a long tuft of wool down the forehead, like the long tuft of hair down the forehead of the Highland cow and of the horse. This is called in all three cases, <gai>logaidh.<eng> The <gai>sguman [sgùman?],<eng> on the other hand, is properly the lock falling back upon the neck. [<gai>logaidh,<eng> tuft of hair above forehead; <gai>sgùmban,<eng> the top of the head or crown, Fr. Allan. <gai>sgùman,<eng> Dw.] The sheep itself forbade denuding it of its <gai>logaidh,<eng> which gives it a pretty and picturesque appearance:

<gai>Na lom mo logaidh,
Na loisg mo chasan,
Na leig mo chasgairt
Dha na coin mhóra.<eng>

Do not clip my lock, do not burn my feet, nor let me slaughtered by the big dogs. [Cf. i, 288 f.]

There are many runes current which show the people’s affection for the sheep.

<gai>cearc-fearainn.<eng> Every tenant under a <gai>tighearna<eng> or <gai>fear-baile<eng> was bound to give him a fat hen on <gai>Latha Samhna<eng> (Hallowmas). This was called a <gai>cearc-fearainn,<eng> and the tax was <gai>càin nan cearc,<eng> the kain or tax of the hens. On some estates a dozen or two dozen eggs must go with the hen. The writer saw yearly the Baileveolan tenants going across from Lismore to Druim a’ Bhuic in Appin with <gai>càin nan cearc.<eng>

On some estates a man was appointed to collect the hens. He was called <gai>am maor-chearc,<eng> the hen-bailiff, and was held in great contempt.

A student at the Scots College in Rome was possessed of an evil spirit. While it was being exorcised he shouted out to a fellow-student:

A similar story is that two students at the College quarrelled over their wine and the one lampooned the other:

There were five small heaps of small stones along the road, four of the heaps twenty-one feet apart and one thirty-nine feet from the nearest of these. There were just five stones in each cairn. No one could tell me what they meant. I found later that they were messages left by tinkers who had passed for those who were to follow.

In the latter, <gai>creach<eng> is perhaps a corruption of <gai>each.<eng> It is associated with horses probably because it deposits its eggs in horse-dung, which is more heating than any other. An observant person in the country in July, August or September will see the beetle rising and soaring in the air above his head with a <gai>strann,<eng> hum, and then suddenly descending with a thud into the horse-dung at his feet.

A small village, named Clàdaich, Clàidich, on the southern shore of Loch Awe, was famous for tartans and specially famous for garters. The man who had not a pair of garters from this village was not considered properly dressed. So great was the demand upon the garters of this little village that the big combs and the little looms were kept at work without intermission. There were several combs in the set, each used after the other by the well-trained workers.

The name of the village, Clàidich, was possibly from <gai>clàd,<eng> wool comb. The place is mentioned in the pipe-tune ‘Olc air mhath le Clann an t-Saoir’:

<gai>Olc air mhath le Clann an t-Saoir,

This was the handle. The condition of the <gai>coidhein<eng> indicated the good or ill condition of the <gai>bean-bhleoghain,<eng> milkmaid—if it was specially clean it showed she might be trusted to make butter and cheese and <gai>annlan<eng> of many kinds.

And on meeting any person or animal whom repeated experience has pronounced an unlucky <gai>comhlaiche,<eng> it is deemed some remedy if a stone is rolled towards him or it.’ See also Henderson, Survivals in Belief, 227; Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands, 253-254. <gai>Còmh[dh]alaiche,<eng> Fr.

<gai>corr.<eng> Heron. The heron is wary and hard to approach; hence the saying in the Western Isles: <gai>Cha sealgair thu gu marbh thu corr is ròn is lachain,<eng> ‘thou art no hunter till thou hast killed heron, seal and duck’. The mainland saying is different: <gai>Cha sealgair thu gu marbh thu corra-ghritheach, fitheach agus fiadh,<eng> ‘thou art no hunter till thou hast killed heron, raven and stag’. Again: <gai>Aois sealgair, seachd corra-ghritheacha a mharbhadh,<eng> ‘a hunter’s lifetime (time) to kill seven herons’. Again: <gai>Ghoideadh tu

[TD 49]

an t-ugh bho’n chorr,<eng> ‘thou wouldst steal the egg from the heron’. The heron is taken as a creature hard to deceive in the following verse:

<gai>Gu bheil cuid de mhnathan ann
Dh’ am bheil gean a’ mhadaidh-ruaidh;
Bheireadh iad as na corran car,
Mhealladh iad fear an dara h-uair.<eng>

Some women there are who have the nature of the fox; they would trick the herons, they would dupe a man a second time.

A curious saying, used by a person when tugging at something difficult, is:

<gai>An tig na ’n téid thu, chailleach,
Na ’n ith thu feòil corra-ghritheach?<eng>

Wilt thou come or go, carlin, or wilt thou eat the flesh of the heron.

A variant is:

<gai>An tig thu na ’n téid thu, chailleach,
Na ’n ith thu feòil curra?<eng>

This called out through the keyhole of the door cured the sick person within. [But see EL, pp. 52-53, for a different explanation.]

To see a heron is a bad omen, in some places an omen of death. It is crossed (forbidden) to kill a heron sitting, a dove with a leaf, or a duck with ducklings (cf. lach le linn).

The oil of the heron is much prized by sportsmen for their guns. The heron’s condition depends on the phase of the moon and the state of the tides; when the moon is new and full the tide is low and the heron gets fish and food.

The decent lad married the corra-chrosgag and set up house for himself. He was proud enough of his elegant wife, thinking that it was himself who had got the good housewife. But it was not long thus until every garment and every stitch, every linen, every shoe and stocking that he had got from his mother was ragged and tattered and riddled like a sieve. ‘Mary, see will you turn to with the big needle and put a stitch in my trousers that will hold them together to cover my nakedness for me, and a stitch in the stocking that will keep it from being lost.’

[TD 51]

‘Dearest of men, happy you, my love, without clothes or linen, without shoes or stockings, and I with so many a good big clew and smooth warm hank waiting for you in the yarn-corner.’ And the woman would go over and fetch across a hank and a clew of yarn that she had got from her mother. She would take a finger’s length or two from the clew and measure the man’s foot and calf for making him a pair of hose. Then she would throw the clew and the hank back to the yarn-corner and say, ‘There, stay you there, where there is plenty more of your kind, until I make use of you’. At length and at last the poor fool died of the cold in the seaweed-strand and the elegant wife made a death-dirge to him:

’Twas not death from cold, the cloth being unwaulked, ’twas not death from cold that carried off my little man. He had a big coat, and another big coat, and a big, big, big old coat he had in the house. ’Twas not death from cold that carried off my darling, ’twas not death from cold that carried off my little man.

This occurred long ago, but the name of the <gai>corra-chrosgag<eng> is still remembered in Uist and still causes much merriment among the people. The machairs of Uist are singularly bare, bleak and cold in winter and spring, and to withstand the bitter blasts which sweep along these sandy seaside plains the people must be well clad. On this account when a man is seen walking rapidly along the machair it is not unusual to hear the remark, <gai>Is i a’ chorra-chrosgag tha aig an fhear ud,<eng> ‘it is the corra-chrosgag that man has (for wife)’. Another saying of like import among the people is, <gai>Is luath fear na droch mhnatha air a’ mhachair Uibhisteach,<eng> ‘swift is the man of the bad wife on the machair of Uist’. It is rarely that a man or woman is ill clad in Uist; the Uist women, excellent and industrious at <gai>calanas,<eng> take pride in having their families comfortably clothed.

For weaving he had, of course, a regular charge besides this. The word <gai>cùileagan<eng> is still known in Argyll and Skye. See mulchag bheirteachaidh; sgaid. [In Lewis the weaver’s burden was <gai>bonntais a’ bhreabadair; bunndaist,<eng> HSD. Cf. <gai>càin, toinneamh, bunndaist,<eng> TGSI, xii, 366. A stanza of the old version of ‘Màiri Laghach’ suggests that the joiner, tailor and tinsmith had also to be recompensed and that payment was due at Martinmas:

<gai>Ach ’s iomad gnothach cruaidh
A th’ air an tuathanach fhéin,
’N uair thig an Fhéill Màrtainn
Bidh a làn ’na dhéidh:
Figheadair is tàillear
’G iarraidh màil dhoibh féin,
Saor is gobha ’s ceàrd
A’ togail càin a réis.<eng>

<gai>cuilechion, cuilechionn, cuilchionn, cuilecheann.<eng> Crooked, crafty; cunning, guile, tricks. Two tribes of MacDonalds waged internecine war against one another for the possession of North Uist. One tribe was known as <gai>Sìolachadh Ghoraidh,<eng> the seed of Godfrey, and the other as <gai>Sìolachadh Mhurchaidh,<eng> the seed of Murdoch. A piper of the Godfrey MacDonalds composed a tune reflecting on the Murdoch MacDonalds:

<gai>Gu tràigh, gu tràigh Sìolachadh Mhurchaidh,
Gu tràigh, gu tràigh Sìolachadh Mhurchaidh,
Gu tràigh, gu tràigh Sìolachadh Mhurchaidh,
Sìol dubh nan car,

Sìol nan cuilechion.<eng>

To the shore, to the shore, with the seed of Murdoch; the black seed of the tricks, the seed of guile.

As she lay awake wondering what she would do to mitigate the privations of her people, the form of a good woman who had died recently in Miu’alaidh appeared beside her bed, clothed in glory and light. <gai>Thubhairt an té a bha marbh ris an té a bha beò: ‘Na bitheadh cùram ort, a ghràdhag nam ban, mu dheighinn cor do dhaoine; is farsainn Cuilidh Mhoire.’<eng> (The one who was dead said to the one who was living: ‘Let there be no anxiety upon thee, thou dear one among women. Wide is Mary’s Treasury.’) That year there was an excellent fishing and there was no famine.

A large open bay below Baile nan Cailleach, Benbecula, is called Cuilidh from the abundance of seaweed for manuring the ground that lodges there. [<gai>cuile, cuile-Mhoire, cuilidh,<eng> Fr. Allan.

It was customary to bury a suicide outside the burial ground in a burial place for themselves where neither shadow of moon nor shadow of sun nor shadow of star of the seasons could reach. They were put under the ground between sunset and sunrise, usually at the dead hour of the night between midnight and cockcrow.

There was a woman down at Bonar and she committed suicide on the night of Sunday. There was bitter dispute about her. She had friends and they took advantage of the people and buried her in the burial ground of the fathers on the ridge of midnight. They put the pall on the woman’s corpse, and the pall was never put on a corpse again, no, never again. (From Thomas Ross, over ninety years of age, Inbhir Chasalaidh (Invercassley), Sutherland.)

[Hence the other name: <gai>an duilleag bhàidhte.<eng>] It is common throughout the Isles. [The second form is probably the correct one.

[See SGS, i, 34.]


<gai>each-ursann.<eng> Heriot horse. When a crofter died the proprietor or the sub-proprietor of whom he had held his croft took possession of the best horse the widow possessed. This exaction pressed heavily upon the poor widow and the often helpless children, and caused bitter feeling against those engaged in it. The conscience of the people revolted against it, and in both North and South Uist there were cases of its being withstood. The forfeited horse was called the <gai>each-ursann,<eng> door-post horse, because he stood at <gai>ursann an dorais,<eng> the door-post. [<gai>each ursainn,<eng> Fr. Allan.]

<gai>eadra, eadradh.<eng> Milking-time, whether at morning, noon or night. [For the etymology see Celtica, iii, 300.]

<gai>Ged thug thu bhó bhàinionn uam,	[?bhainne (:eadraidh)
Cha tug thu ’n cadal eadraidh dhìom.<eng>

Though thou tookest the white [?milch-] cow from me, thou hast not taken the noon sleep from me.

This is alleged to have been said by a widow woman reft of her cow by the proprietor.

A similar thing is said against MacDonald of Barasdal, Knoydart:

<gai>Ged thug thu Blàrag ghràdhach dhìom,
Cha tug thu tràigh bhàn Bhàrasdail.<eng>

Though thou tookest dear ‘Blàrag’ (‘White-face’) from me, thou hast not taken the white strand of Barasdal.

The ill laird of Barasdal then sent his men and horses to plough up the white strand of Barasdal, which they did so effectively that although once full of many kinds of shellfish it has had none since. The shellfish beds were turned up with the plough and allowed to rot in the sun. ‘Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap’; the ill laird of Barasdal’s death was early and unlamented. His fame rests upon an instrument of torture which he invented and to which he gave his name. [This was Colla Bàn, second of Barisdale; see TGSI, xiii, 85 ff.; Clan Donald, iii, 337-342.]

<gai>faircill, fairceall.<eng> A musical instrument, a lyre; a bread-toaster; a drinking vessel.

The musical instrument is also called <gai>faircill ciùil<eng> or <gai>ceòil.<eng> The bread-toaster is also called <gai>faircill arain<eng> and <gai>crann arain,<eng> bread-beam or wooden bread-holder. It is in the shape of a curve, about a third of a circle, and stands on three legs or feet; the bread stands against it to be toasted at the round fire on the floor.

The drinking vessel, <gai>faircill òil,<eng> was also called <gai>stòp faircill.<eng> The stoup was used at any function where many people were present. It was a round stoup of wood with two tall handles opposite one another. The bottom was flush with the sides, while the handles had a graceful inward curve. [Judging by the drawing the handles extended above the top of the vessel, and the vessel was waisted above the base.] It held beer, mead and other liquids. It was handed round the <gai>sreath<eng> or <gai>cuairt,<eng> rank or circle, each person taking a <gai>srùbag<eng> or <gai>balgam,<eng> sip or mouthful, and passing the vessel to his neighbour. The <gai>faircill<eng> used in a chief’s house was large, heavy and of a standard capacity. The bodyguard of the Lord of the Isles was selected from the best families and from the strongest youths within their extensive territories. The men had many

[TD 68]

privileges, and great strength, dexterity and valour was required of them. They were called <gai>fir mhóra, fir taighe, luchd taighe, teaghlach, galloglaich,<eng> great men, house-men, house-troop, household, armed band [gallow-glasses], and by other names. They had special rules for the management of the <gai>faircill.<eng> Each balanced the full vessel on the palm of his hand, drank from it, and handed it on; the fingers were spread apart to allow the next man to place his fingers between them. One hand only was used, the other holding the weapons. All this required a strong arm and a dexterous hand, and the man who failed was not admitted into the feat of the <gai>faircill.<eng> A cup similar to this, and similarly used, was the <gai>meadar;<eng> the handles of this, however, were straight. [<gai>farch, farch-chiùil, fairchil,<eng> ii, 289.] <gai>Faircioll, faircill<eng> in the Outer Isles corresponded to <gai>diorcall, diorcaill<eng> in the Inner Isles. [See Waifs and Strays, v, 41, where the vessel used by the Lord of the Isles’ bodyguard is called <gai>diorcal.<eng>]

The food and drink given to <gai>Ùisdean Mór mac Ghilleasba Chléirich,<eng> Big Hugh son of Archibald the Clerk, when he was thrown into <gai>toll dubh Dhùn Tuilm,<eng> the black hole of Duntulm, was <gai>dà cheathramh chaorail dearg làn salainn agus dà stòp faircill loma-làn leanna,<eng> two quarters of red sheep-flesh full of salt and two large stoups brimful of ale—one of which, however, had a false bottom.

From the use of <gai>sreath<eng> referred to above come such phrases as <gai>Cha bhuin thu dh’ an t-sreath,<eng> ‘thou wilt not attain [dost not belong to] the circle’; <gai>òl lit feuch am faigh thu dh’ an t-sreath,<eng> ‘sup porridge to see whether thou wilt attain the circle’. These were inducements held out to children to stimulate their appetites. The <gai>sreath<eng> represented strength and dexterity, and both young men and maidens practised gymnastic exercises to attain it.

<gai>Stòl faircill<eng> was a crescent-shaped stool. [The stool the story of which is told in the following note, and which is mentioned by Mrs Mary Mackellar in her paper on ‘The Sheiling’, TGSI, xiv, 152 ff., seems exactly to correspond to the description of the <gai>stòl faircill.<eng> It was in the possession of the late Professor J. Carmichael Watson.]

The writer has a small primitive stool on which Prince Charlie sat in a summer shieling in North Uist during his wanderings after Culloden. When he came into the shieling, three girls were busily at work, all merrily singing the while. <gai>Bha té ri fuine, té ri muidhe, agus té ri càise<eng>—one was baking, one was churning, and one was making cheese. The girls had no English and the Prince but little Gaelic, but they gave him the best entertainment they had, which the people always do to strangers. When the Prince had gone and the girls came to know who their visitor had been, a friendly struggle took place among them for the possession of the stool on which he had sat. In this struggle the stool came against the face of one of the girls, knocking out a tooth. On seeing this mishap her companions generously handed the girl the stool, one of them

[TD 69]

facetiously saying to her, ‘As you have got so disfigured in the cause of the Prince (<gai>an adhbhar a’ Phrionnsa<eng>), you will need a <gai>tochar,<eng> dowry, to set you up!’ [According to North Uist tradition, this incident took place at Ardmaddy, and the three girls were the daughters of Ewen Macpherson.]

A descendant of this girl, a respectable woman in the island of Boreray, North Uist, gave me the stool some twelve years ago. It is a small rude thing, the seat of which is a crescent-shaped tree-root; one end of the crescent curves downwards, forming a natural leg; pegs are inserted into holes in the seat to form legs at the other end and at the centre of the crescent. [Its present height is about eight inches, and it is a rather uneasy and precarious seat. The legs, however, were at one time longer. Some vandal has used it as axe-block, and it also bears marks of fire.—Note by J. Carmichael Watson.]

The people spoke and sang of the Prince as <gai>Am Buachaille Bàn, Am Buachaille Buidhe,<eng> ‘the fair-haired herdsman’, ‘the yellow-haired herdsman’. The allusion was understood without their committing themselves.

<gai>Am faca sibh tighinn am Buachaille Bàn?

<gai>fìon. Wine. Wine is so often mentioned in the literature of the people that it must have been at least fairly plentiful. Probably much of the wine consumed was made at home from native fruits which the people seem to have had in abundance. The Church undoubtedly fostered farming and horticulture among the people. Among the ruined homes it is touching to find still the outlines of the gardens, even after long possession by the sheep, the deer and the wealthy stranger. The writer has traced these gardens and seen remains of various shrubs and plants in hundreds of places, and he confesses that he was much moved at the mistaken policy, the inhuman barbarity, the dreadful arrogance, with which his beloved people have been treated.

The people say that from only one kind of heather can wine or ale be made; their fathers praised this drink highly, but the art of making it is lost. There are still families, however, who make excellent wine from garden fruits by recipies known only to a few.

This is then taken out and placed in clean cold water, whence it is taken and rolled into a ball, rubbed over with butter and toasted before the fire. This ball is called <gai>fisteag, feisteag,<eng> and is considered a great luxury.


<gai>fitheach.<eng> Raven. The raven’s proverbial wisdom is nowhere more strikingly shown than in its provision for its young. It is the earliest bird in the Highlands to breed [cf. the verses at i, 172 f.] and provides for this early hungry season in a most marvellous manner. Constructing its nest of sticks, twigs and tangle, it thoroughly covers this framework down to the floor with layer upon layer of slimy mud full of maggots and other small life. Not only does this make the nest warm, but when the raven is sitting on its nest the warmth of its body brings the torpid maggots to life and these are eaten by the young chicks when no other food is available. This other food includes tender lambs from distant flocks, the raven being too prudent to spoil his home reputation and thus endanger his life. Ravens will not nest near each other. A raven established in a given spot will fight furiously with and chase away an intruder. [See also ii, 291 ff.]

<gai>Nì bheil slad an nead an fhithich
Nach bheil an cridhe Dhòmhaill.<eng>

There is no theft in the raven’s nest but is in the heart of Donald.

A tribe of men in Benbecula are called <gai>na Fithich,<eng> a highly apposite name. The tribe left Lewis for the good of Lewis. They are called in Benbecula <gai>na Grùdairean,<eng> the brewers, but whether they were brewers to MacKenzie before leaving Lewis or brewers to Clanranald after coming to Benbecula is not now remembered. They are a plausible people, but unreliable in character. This is in their blood.

The <gai>gàdag<eng> was made of beaten rushes with the pith extracted. The ends of the <gai>gàdag<eng> were well secured to prevent fraying; hence the sayings <gai>gàdag le ceann sgaoilte<eng> or <gai>gàdag ’s a ceann sgaoilte,<eng> ‘a gàdag with its end frayed’, applied to a frowsy woman, and <gai>gàdag ’s a dà cheann sgaoilte,<eng> ‘a gàdag with both its ends frayed’, applied to a very frowsy woman, a very untidy girl, a slovenly person in general. A place in St Kilda is called <gai>Cleite Gàdaig.<eng> [Dwelly does not mark the vowel long, but it is long and is not, therefore, from <gai>gad,<eng> which in any case is mas. and forms dimin. <gai>goidean.<eng> Cf. the St Kilda place-name <gai>Leac na Gàdaig,<eng> riming with ard oirr, G, 47.

The <gai>fuath,<eng> dreadful phantom, was an ill being who could assume the form of man or woman, bird or beast, as best suited his evil purpose, and could do, if necessary, the work of ten or twenty men. The <gai>fuath<eng> came to Dòmhall Odhar, Dun Donald, in Coll one day in autumn and asked for work, his payment to be a <gai>gàdag<eng> of corn at night. Dòmhall Odhar agreed to this and gave him a day’s work. The <gai>fuath<eng> worked and worked so well that the whole of Dòmhall Odhar’s corn was cut by nightfall. Dòmhall Odhar rejoiced and his wife prepared the harvest feast. The <gai>fuath<eng> began to fill his <gai>gàdag,<eng> and he was filling and filling his <gai>gàdag<eng> until he had the whole of Dòmhall Odhar’s corn-crop under his rope. Dòmhall Odhar was dismayed and sorely perplexed; as a man of honour

[TD 77]

he could not come <gai>an cois fhacail,<eng> against his word, and as a man of sense he could not lose his whole crop to this extraordinary man. When he recovered utterance he exclaimed in the bitterness of his heart:

<gai>Màrt a threabh mi,
Màrt a chuir mi,
Màrt a bhuain mi:
Fhir thug dhomh na trì Màirt,			[Thus, a luaidh
Na leig mo bharr buileach			[uile
Dh’an an aon ghàdaig ghuaille!<eng>

Tuesday I ploughed, Tuesday I sowed, Tuesday I reaped: Thou who gavest me the three Tuesdays, allow not Thou my whole crop into the one shoulder-rope!

When the <gai>fuath<eng> heard the name of God implied, the <gai>gàdag<eng> of corn fell from his nerveless grasp, and he flew away like the black raven of the hill amidst clouds of flameless smoke, and never again returned to the island of Coll, ‘no, never again, thou beloved (<gai>a rùin<eng>)’. [See this story in Waifs and Strays, iii, 216-221. The <gai>gàdag<eng> is there called <gai>gad-cuail,<eng> a withy for tying a bundle. <gai>Màrt<eng> is explained, 298-299, as the fit time for doing any particular part of agricultural work, as <gai>Màrt cuir,<eng> fit time of sowing; <gai>Màrt fuine,<eng> fit time of baking, in August; <gai>Màrt buana,<eng> fit time of reaping, in September.

I was in Edinburgh yesterday, I am in my own hall tonight, and as much as there is in the sun-mote there is not in my frame of vigour.

[<gai>Sprochd<eng> appears to be, not <gai>sproc(hd),<eng> dejection, but a variant of <gai>sprac,<eng> life, vigour, activity.

The yew was sacred in the Highlands and was used not only for making bows but for warding off witches, divining events and safe-guarding milk. <gai>Iubhar beinne<eng> and <gai>caorrann,<eng> mountain ash or rowan, were burnt on the doorstep of the byre on the first day of the quarter, on Beltane Day and Hallowmas. The byre lintel was sprinkled with wine, or, failing wine, with human urine. A rod of these or some other sacred wood was placed above the lintel. Tar was put behind the ear and below the <gai>feaman,<eng> tail, of the cows. This was done to safeguard the cattle <gai>bho dhosgaidh, bho ealtradh agus bho adhaircean a chéile,<eng> from mischance, mishap and each other’s horns. A cheese and a churning were made before sunrise to keep the fairies and all uncanny creatures away for the year or for the season. [<gai>iubhair beinne,<eng> Fr. Allan.]

<gai>laom, laoman.<eng> The whitish silvery hue arising from putrescence; mould, mildew, a term applied to corn that has become mildewed whether on the ground or in the stack, anything musty or mouldy; phosphor light, light or fire without heat. <gai>laom<eng> also means a moth, <gai>laoman,<eng> a little moth; the Argyll form of the latter is <gai>laorman,<eng> as <gai>laorman olainn,<eng> a wool moth; <gai>laorman feòir<eng> or <gai>laorman fuinn,<eng> a grass moth. <gai>laomadh.<eng> The act of becoming mildewed, used of corn.

From <gai>laom<eng> comes the following.

<gai>laomachan.<eng> ‘Little mouldy one’, was a rind of cheese used for divination. The cheese must be made on one of the four old festivals of the year: <gai>Bealltain,<eng> Beltane; <gai>Lùnasd, Lùnasdal<eng> or <gai>Lùnasdain,<eng> Lammas; <gai>Samhain,<eng> Hallowtide; and <gai>Féill Brighde,<eng> the Feast of Brigit; but on which of these is now uncertain. The milk used was that of a cow which had eaten the <gai>mòthan,<eng> pearlwort, for since the plant was sained the cheese was sained also. Twelve months after the cheese was made it was used. A small hole was made through the rind, and through this the diviner looked down through the <gai>fàrlas,<eng> smoke-vent of the house. The name of the first person thus seen through these two orifices was the name of the future spouse. When the <gai>laomachan<eng> was placed under the pillow, the

[TD 95]

sleeper would in dreams see his future spouse coming towards him with gifts; were the person seen receding, it indicated a parting. The <gai>laomachan<eng> safeguarded its wearer from the wiles of the fairies of the mound, from the venom of the hosts of the air, and from the misleading light of the <gai>teine mór<eng> or <gai>teine sionn,<eng> will o’ the wisp. For naming, for dreaming and for safeguarding, the <gai>laomachan<eng> was effective only on the anniversary of the festival on which it was made, and only to those who had faith and sincerity of heart; only to those who bowed to them were the names true. Many curious rites and ceremonies connected with the <gai>laomachan<eng> and its use are now but dimly to be descried through the darkness of ages.

<gai>Maol Domhnaich.<eng> ‘The tonsured one of the Lord’, was the name by which a male child not yet baptised was known. Griadach (q.v.) was the name by which a female child not yet baptised was known [see i, 115]. When the child was baptised and recognised by the Church this temporary name ceased. For a natural child, however, baptism was not always to be got, in which case the temporary name remained, occasionally for life. When the father of the child failed to provide for it and the mother was poor, the woman got a dole from the Church funds. In this case the luckless child was called <gai>Isean Eaglaise,<eng> ‘Church chick’. In Caithness and Sutherland he was called <gai>Isean Circ (Circe),<eng> ‘Kirk chick’, and generally received in English the surname Kirk or Kirke. In Skye and Argyll a natural child raised by doles from the Church was called in English ‘Ludovic’. [Ludovick was the general equation in English for the name Maol Domhnaich. In Lewis it has now been reduced to Louis.]

[TD 109]

The proverb regarding yawning takes different forms in different districts. In Uist, where there are no trees, it is: <gai>Miananaich o bhial gu bial mar iananaich o shliabh gu sliabh,<eng> yawning from mouth to mouth like birds flying (?) from hill to hill. In Morar, where trees are abundant, they say: <gai>Meunanaich bho thé gu té mar eunanaich bho gheug gu geug,<eng> yawning from woman to woman like birds flying (?) from branch to branch. Another form is: <gai>Miananaich bho neach gu neach mar ian bho phreas gu preas,<eng> yawning from one person to another like a bird from bush to bush. [Cf. Holmer, Studies on Argyllshire Gaelic, p. 190: <gai>théid am mèananaich o dhuine gu duine mar a théid an t-eun o dhuilleag gu duilleag.<eng> For Irish versions see Éigse, i, 307-8; ii, 149: fé mar ritheann an mhéanfadhach ó dhuine gu duine; tá tú dham thóirt ó bhile go bile mar théigheanns an méanfadhach ó dhuine go duine; téidheann an méanfach ó dhuine go duine mar théid an t-éan ó bhile go bile.] See mànran.


Incessant yawning, wanness and weariness, without any apparent cause, are signs of a person’s having been injured by the evil eye.

The word also means the sandy shore of a lake; the sandy ground of an arm of the sea which becomes dry at ebb; a sandy ford on a river. Loch na Morthach is a sandy-shored loch in North Uist.

anything and the women quarrelling about nothing, so that the good St Ronan could not say his prayers in peace because of their clamour.

While he was still praying a messenger came to tell him that a fish was waiting at the <gai>laimrig,<eng> landing place, to carry him away.

The woollen sail was heavy and cumbrous at all times, and in rain and wind it was dangerous. The last <gai>seòl plangaid<eng> seen in the Long Island was that of a boat which came from St Kilda to Hoghgearraidh, North Uist, in 18—, having been driven out of its course [on a voyage] to Obbe, Harris. The boat was in danger of being swamped in the stormy bay of Hoghgearraidh, and the people in a miserable plight from cold, wet and hunger, and afraid to land lest the Uist people, known to eat seals, which are simply men and women under enchantment, should kill and eat them! At the risk of their own lives, however, the Uistmen rescued them and treated them most hospitably. The woollen sail was driven out by home-made canvas, and home-made canvas has now been ousted by canvas from Glasgow.

A girl who had lost her mother and had not been taught <gai>calanas,<eng> wool working, married. Her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law twitted and taunted the young wife that she could not do <gai>calanas<eng> and the young wife grieved sorely. When her husband lay asleep she lay awake sorrowing that she could not card and spin and weave. Then the dead mother of the girl came to her and soothingly said while drying her tears, ‘Weep not, thou my beloved child, and I will teach thee <gai>calanas’<eng>—

<gai>Cuir làmh an t-sniamh air an topan,
Làmh an tuigein air an t-sniamh,

Dèan-s’ a chomain air an t-sniamh.<eng>

Place thine hand of spinning on the tuft, thine hand of smoothing on the twisting thread, and as the sheep nibbles the knoll do thou the same with the spinning.

The kind words of her dead mother inspired the girl with hope and courage and she set to work in good earnest at <gai>calanas,<eng> retiring to rest with the benediction of Mary’s lark and rising again with the first crow of the old cock. Before the young wife had become a mother she had made tartans and plaidings and blankets for her husband such as he had never had before.

Henderson, who equates it with <gai>Di-domhnaich Crom Dubh,<eng> makes it the last Sunday in July, Gaelic Dialects, ZCP, iv, 269; but a verse quoted in NGP, 167, makes it seem likely that <gai>Di-domhnaich Crom Dubh<eng> meant Easter Sunday.]
