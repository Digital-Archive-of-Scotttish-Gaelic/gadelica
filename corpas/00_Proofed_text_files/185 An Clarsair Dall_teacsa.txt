SOURCES OF THE TEXT

F	The Fernaig MS. in Glasgow University Library. 2 vols. See Mackinnon, Catalogue of Gaelic Manuscripts, 267 ff.; Reliquiae Celticae II, i ff. The MS. is transcribed by Alexander Cameron in Reliquiae Celticae II, 4-137, and, with vis-à-vis transliteration (MM) into conventional orthography, by Malcolm Macfarlane in Làmh-sgrìobhainn Mhic Rath (LSMR). The first page of the first volume is dated 1688, but this marks only the inception of the work. Two items towards the end of the second volume have the date 1693, and the song here edited comes after that. That the MS. was written by Duncan Macrae of Inverinate in Kintail was demonstrated, from internal and circumstantial evidence, by Professor Donald Mackinnon in TGSI XI, 311 ff. This is now confirmed by the discovery among the Chisholm papers of a letter dated 23rd January 1696, written by “D M Ra” in a hand which is identical with that of the Fernaig MS. (For a photostat the writer is indebted to Mr I. R. Mackay, Inverness.)

Oran do Iain Breac Mac Leòid

Tha móran móran mulaid
an déidh tuineachadh am chom:
gur bliadhna leam gach seachdain
o nach facas Iain donn;
nan cluinninn ged nach faicinn			5
fear do phearsa thigh’nn do’n fhonn
gu sgaoileadh mo bhròn ’s m’airsneal
mar shneachd òg ri aiteamh trom.

Their mi hó ro gheala beag
’s na hó ro chalan hì					10
their mi hó ro gheala beag
’s na hó ro chalan hì
chalan hì ho hù ra bho
’s na hó ro chalan hì
gur fada bho na tràthan sin				15
nach robh mo ghràdh ’san tìr.

A luchd comuinn seo nan éisdeadh sibh
ri cuid de m’ sgeul gun mheang,
’s mi caoidh an uasail bheadarraich
tha bhuam an fheadh-s’ air chall:			20
cha robh cron ri fhaotainn ort
ach thu bhith faoilidh ann,
on fhuair mi gu h-ùr éibhinn thu
’n Dùn­éideann a measg Ghall.

[TD 5]

[Beurla]

[TD 6]

Thug mi ionnsaigh fhada				25
as do dhéidh ’s mi ’n cladach cruaidh,
thug mi ionnsaigh bhearraideach
’sa’ chamhanaich Di­luain:
cha d’fhuaras an t-òg aigeantach
bu mhacanta measg sluaigh,				30
’s chan fhaodainn a’ mhisg àicheadh
’s do dheoch­slàinte dol mun cuairt.

Thug mi ionnsaigh sgairteil
as do dhéidh an cladach doirbh;
ged nach tug mi capall leam,				35
na h-agair mi ’na lorg;
gu robh mo choiseachd athaiseach,
’s an rathad a bhith dorch’,
le breislich mhic­nan­cliathan,
’s do làmh fhial ’ga dhìoladh orm.			40

Fhir seo tha mi ’g iomradh ort,
’gad iondrainn uam tha mì;
sròn ardanach an fhiùghantais,
cha b’fhiù leat a bhith crìon;
nan cluinninn féin gun tigeadh tu,			45
fhir chridhe, dh’fhios nan crìoch,
gun òlainn do dheoch­slàinte,
ge do phàighinn i, de fhìon.

Beul macanta ciùin ràbhartach
’n uair tharladh tu ’s taigh­òsd,			50
a dh’fhàs gu seirceil suairce,
gaol nam ban ’s nan gruagach òg;
’s iomadh maighdeann cheutach
a bha déidheil air do phòig
le’m b’ait bhith cunntadh spréidhe dhuit,		55
’s a deaslàmh féin le deòin.

[TD 7]

[Beurla]

[TD 8]

Cha robh fuath no greathachd ort,
ri t’amharc bha thu caoin,
saighdeir foinnidh flathail
air an gabhadh gach neach gaol;			60
euchdach treubhach urramach
bha ’n curaidh glan gun ghaoid,
gu fearail meanmnach miosail,
air nach faighte ’n tiotal claon.

Saighdeir fearail fuasgailteach,			65
fear cruadalach gun mheang;
ceann­feadhn’ air thùs na brataich e,
’ga taisbeanadh ’san Fhraing;
thig airm a réir a phearsa
air an laoch bu sgairteil greann;			70
’n uair dh’éireadh airde lasrach ort,
’s mairg chasadh riut ’san am.

Thig claidheamh socrach stàilinn duit
de’n t-seòrsa ’s fearr ’sa’ bhùth,
’s e fulangach o bharrdheis				75
gu ruig a cheannbheart duirn;
faobhar air a’ gheurchruaidh sin
nach gabhadh leum no lùb;
lann air dhreach na daolaig,
’s i air taobh deas­làimh mo rùin.			80

Is iad siod na h-airm a thaghainn duit,
’s tu ’n deaghaidh an ratreut:
paidhear dhag nach diùltadh
agus fùdar gorm d’an réir;
do ghunna an déidh falmhachaidh,			85
’s tu marbhtach air an treud,
anns an làimh nach greagarra,
’s tu leantainn as an déidh.

Is fhada leam an comhnaidh seo
th’ aig Eòin a measg nan Gall;				90
cha ghiorra leam an oidhche
bhith ’ga chuimhneachadh gach am;
dh’fhaoiltichinn nam faicinn thu
tigh’nn seachad anns a’ ghleann—
cha ghabhainn féin bonn faiteachais			95
ged ghlacadh tu mo gheall.

Corr agus trì ràithean
tha thu ’d chadal sàmhach uam,
gun t’fhaicinn on a dh’fhàg thu sinn,
’s ar cridhe ghnàth fo ghruaim;			100
a nis on thug thu cùl rium
’s a laigh smuirnean air ar gruaidh,
mar sholus an déidh dorchadais
tha Tormod mar bu dual.

Is e Tormod òg mo shubhachas			105
air bhuidheachas Shìol Leòid:
mas mac an àit an athar thu,
thig fathast gu bhith mór
anns an Dùn gu flathail
’n robh do chinneadh roimhe beò,			110
mac ratha dhùisgeas éibhneas domh—
le aighear thréig mi bròn.

Ma thuirt iad ogha Thormoid riut,
b’i siod an fhoirmfhuil ghlan;
ma thuirt iad iarogh’ Ruaidhri riut,			115
b’i ’n ardfhuil uaibhreach mhear;
’s ogha ’n Eòin gun truailleadh
a thug suairceas air gach neach:
mac an fhir nach b’fhuathach leam
an nochd thog suas mo ghean.			120

Féill nan Crann

A rìgh gur cruaidh mo sgeul,
mo chràdh geur, mo chreach, mo chall,
o laigh air m’inntinn sac
’s a laigh air m’acfhainn mall;
on dh’imich uam an crann,				125
’s nach fhaigh mi shamhla ’s tìr,
gur adhbhar mulaid leam
mo chrann a bhith d’am dhìth.

Chan fhasa leam na ’m bàs
a bhith fo thàir nam ban;				130
chan fhaod mi dhol ’nan dàil
on dh’fhàilnich air mo ghean;
’s e their iad, “Ciod am feum
a dh’fheudas a bhith ann?
Chaidh ionnstramaid o ghleus				135
on chaill e fhéin a chrann.”

Gur fanaideach an gàire
dhèanadh àd fa leth
’n uair chì iad fear gun chrann
’na shuidhe thall ’san t-sreath;			140
ma tharlas mi ’nan caraibh,
’s ann theannas iad ri cainnt,
is their gach té le fanaid,
“Am faic thu ’m fear gun chrann!”

[TD 13]

[TD 14]

An caidreabh nam ban òg				145
d’am dheòin cha téid mi ann;
chan èalaidh mi d’an còir
o nach éisdear leò mo chainnt;
ma theannas mi ri comhradh,
’s an bheir iad dhomh-s’ an cùl,			150
is their iad le fum­fam,
“Am fear a chaill a chrann ’san smùr!”

Thuirt Baintighearna Mhic Leòid,
“Cha chreach gun tòir rug ort
(ma tha do chrann ad dhìth,				155
chan iongn’ thu bhith fo sproc);
ach air nàile dhèanainn uircheas,
on dh’éirich dhuit an call,
’s nam faight’ a shamhl’ air féill,
gun ceannaichinn féin duit crann.			160

“Tha agam-sa riut iochd,
ged nach bithinn aig Mac Leòid,
gu t’fhiosrachadh roimh chàch
le mo làmh a chur am phòc;
gun gleidhinn-sa dhuit crann,				165
is gum pàigheadh le òr dearg,
’s cha bhi do chrann ad dhìth,
ged a chosd e mìle marg.”

“Beannachd dhuibh-s’ is buaidh,
on ’s sibh thuigeadh uam mar tha,			170
ag amharc air mo thruaigh’,
on tha mi cruaidh an càs.
Air eagal mi dhol bàs,
cuiribh sgioba ’s bàt’ air tuinn
a bheir a Barraidh crann,				175
ar neo geall a bhith d’a chionn.”

[TD 15]

[Beurla]

[TD 16]

“Tha agam-sa ri t’fheum
nach leig éislean anns an tòir—
bàta gnìomhach gleusd’
agus sgioba treun do­leòn:				180
théid nighean Mhic Leòid
is Nic Neacail mhór, na suinn,
is nighean a’ Ghoill Ghlais
chur a mharsantachd a’ chroinn.

“Bidh Nic Fhionghain air an stiùir			185
is nigh’n Uisdein anns a’ bheirt,
Nic Fhearghuis anns an sgòid
is an stagh aig Seònaid Bhreac;
nigh’n Anndra Chaoil ’na draip,
is i ’n taice ris an aoir,					190
’s i trusadh leatha suas
mar bu luime luaithe ghaoth.

“Nic Mhaol­mhoire air thùs siùil,
’s i a’ dèanamh iùil gu grinn,
nigh’n Domhnaill Ruaidh ’san truis			195
’s Seònaid Fhriseal anns an taoim;
Nic an Fhleisdeir gu trom tinn,
’s i cur os a cinn a luchd;
is bidh ’n allsa ealamh réidh
aig nigh’n Thormoid Léith nam muc.”		200

Dh’fhalbh am bàta bhuainn
is air chuan cha d’ rinn i dàil
gus an deachaidh i air tìr
ann an Cìosamal Mhic Nèill.
An uair ghabh na seòid mu thàmh			205
is a chaisg iad pàirt de’n sgìos,
chaidh fios an tuath ’s an deas
dh’fheuch ’n robh crann r’a reic as tìr.

[TD 17]

[Beurla]

[TD 18]

An sin ’n uair sgaoil an sgeul
feadh tìr Mhic Nèill air fad,				210
chruinnich iad gun dàil
eadar làidir agus lag;
gach té is fear gun stad,
’s gum bu bhras a chaidh iad ann,
’s mnài òga ’m feum nam bréid,			215
’s iad ’nan ruith gu féill nan crann.

Sin ’n uair ghlac a’ bhreisleach
Nic an Fhleisdeir anns a’ bhùth;
chaidil i ’n déidh chàich,
’s b’adhbhar gàire i ’n uair dhùisg;			220
an uair dh’fhosgail i dà shùil
is a ghlac i lùths ’na clì:
“Rinn luchd na foille fàth orm—
’s ann gun fhios a dh’fhàg iad mì.”

An uair dh’fhosgail i dà shùil				225
gun do ghlac i lùths nan eang,
is ràinig i an fhéill
’s iad a’ réiteachadh mu’n chrann;
’n uair tharlaidh i ’nan car
ghlac i gad nan crann ’na dorn,			230
is thàr is leis gun fhios
far ’n robh nighean mhór Mhic Leòid.

Thuirt nighean Mhic Leòid
gum bu leòr siod mur bu ghann;
thuirt Meig nigh’n Domhnaill Ruaidh		235
gum bu truagh e bhith gun cheann;
bha Nic Mhaol­mhoire ’g ràitinn
gum bu stàilinn bha ’sa’ chrann,
’s nam faigheadh e ’na ruagairean
gum biodh e shuas air ball.				240

Oran mu Oifigich Araid

Séid na builg sin, ghille, dhom,
ri ’n inneoin fair an t-ord;
beag iongnadh dhuinn bhith aighearach,
’s deagh naidheachd gu breith oirnn;
na mheala mi mo léine,				245
o ’s i éideadh tha ri m’fheòil,
mur dhèante leam gàir’ éibhinn
ach Rìgh Seumas thiochd gu chòir.

Ged their iad ris na ceardannan
gur gnàth leò bhith ri òl,				250
chan ’eil misg no mearan orm
ag aithris duibh mo sgeòil;
ach siod mar tha mo bharail-sa,
giodh amaideach mo ghlòir:
an rìgh-s’ thàinig a dh’annas oirnn,			255
gur faileas e no ceò.

Is gur iomadh neach bha aighearach
r’a fhaighinn as a thòs;
cha chreideadh iad nach b’aingeal e
thug flaitheas daibh d’a dheòin:			260
ach ’n uair thig an sùilean daibh
’s a dhùisgeas iad air chòir,
cha bheag an t-adhbhar tùirse leo
an umhla rinn iad dò.

[TD 21]

Dh’éirich iad gu basdalach				265
le brataichean fo sheòl,
is thréig iad an rìgh dleasdanach—
’s e ’m Prionnsa b’aite leò;
an diu nach mór an diombuaidh dhaibh,
r’a chunntadh air a thòs,				270
’n uair dh’fhiosraich iad an cuntartan
mar thionndaidh cuid diubh cleòc.

An uair dh’fhairich iad e fàiligeadh
cha tàmhadh iad d’an deòin;
bha geilt is gruaim dan sàrachadh			275
o’n gruaidh gu sàil am bròig’;
ord gobha na ceardaich
ged a tharladh e ’nan dorn,
cha sparradh iad an t-snàthad leis
an àiteiginn gu crò.					280

Ach faire, faire, ’n làsdalachd!
bha sin ’gam bàdhadh uair,
o chaipteanan gu màidsearan
tha ’n dràsd air dol a fuaim;
shaoil leò gum biodh sgiathan				285
air dà thrian ’s na bha ’s taobh tuath,
’s gu siuibhleadh iad, mur riaghladh iad,
na h-iarmailtean air luaths.

Ach tha cuibhle ’n fhortain àbhartach
dar thig a stràc mun cuairt,				290
a’ bhail a réir ’s mar charadh leath’
’nam barail mìltibh sluaigh;
’s nan tugte geur an aire dhi,
tha trian de carachd cruaidh;
chan fhoghainn strìth no ardan daibh			295
gu làmh thoirt air a buaidh.

Is léir a bhlàth r’a fhaicsinn
air na caipteanan-s’ bha nuadh,
a dh’inntrig gu treun acfhainneach,
glé thartarach am fuaim;				300
ge bu mhór an tairneanach
’n uair thàr iad àit air sluagh,
chuir clach dhona ’n arddoruis
am buinn ’s an sàilean uath’.

Bha ’nan dùil an uiridh,				305
dar a sguireadh iad d’an gleus,
gun géilleadh gach uile neach
gu urram thoirt daibh fhéin;
duirt a’ bhean gun chunnalas—
chaidh ’n sionfhacal-s’ am feum―			310
“Na bug gun cuir thu unnam e,
ged mhionnainn thu deth leum.”

Ach ’n uair thig Rìgh Seumas
’s a dh’éighear e ’na chòir,
càit am bi na h-eucoraich				315

“Ta mi ’m barail gur mi,				825

A Mhic-alla ’n seo bhà
anns a’ bhaile ’n do thàr mi m’iùl,

Ach tillidh mise gu d’ chainnt,

NOTES

ORAN DO IAIN BREAC MAC LEOID

The title and first verse and chorus cannot be supplied from JM, as pp. 190-191 are missing from the MS. (or at least from the microfilm). In SO the title is “Oran do dh-Iain Breac Mac-Leoid.” The song can be dated only within a certain period—after the Blind Harper had taken up residence in Dunvegan under the patronage of Iain Breac in 1681 (see Introduction, pp. xliv-xlv), but apparently before his removal to Glenelg c. 1689 (ibid., pp. lvi ff.). It is true that he laments his separation from Iain Breac (l. 42), but this is explained (ll. 89-90) by the latter’s absence for more than nine months in the Low Country, or perhaps in England (a measg nan Gall). There is nothing to indicate that the Harper himself is living at a distance from Dunvegan, and the occasional use of the first plural personal pronoun might suggest that he regards himself to some extent as spokesman for other members of MacLeod’s household.


3. Cf. l. 673. See also GSMM, ll. 3-4:

<gai>is bliadhna an t-seachdain
on a phòs thu,<eng>

“the week since you married is (seems like) a year”. Contrast a bhliadhna na seachdain seo, “a year ago this week”.

4. facas: may be regarded as a survival of the -s preterite, 1. sg. dep. active. Cf. ll. 29, 791. For other probable examples see BGh, p. 398.

Iain donn: the adjective is merely descriptive, and does not imply that he was known as Iain Donn: he was known as Iain Breac, because his face was pitted by the marks resulting from small-pox (blàth na brice). Ramsay of Ochtertyre interpreted the term in the sense of “freckled” (Introduction, p. xxxi), but that is broicneach.

5. ged nach faicinn: a reference to his blindness.

8. ri aiteamh: the preposition is used here, as often, in speaking of the weather conditions under which an event takes

[TD 96]

place; e.g., ri an-uair, “in time of storm” (usually at sea). Cf. l. 601.

22. ann: the translation is rather tentative, as the exact force of the prepositional pronoun eludes definition.

24. This is a reference to the Harper’s first meeting with Iain Breac. See Introduction, pp. xliv-xlv.

25 ff. A possible interpretation of this and the following verse might be that the last occasion upon which the Harper was in the chief’s company had been a convivial one, perhaps immediately before the latter’s departure for the Low Country. Why the retainer made such strenuous efforts to follow his patron is not clear. On the other hand, the reference may still be to what happened in Edinburgh. Did the Harper follow Iain Breac to the shore at Leith (or South Queensferry), from whence MacLeod may have embarked on his way home? When leaving Edinburgh for the north, a convenient route was via Leith and the ferry to Burntisland, and thence to Perth. Cf. The Book of Dunvegan I, 211.

27. The same line occurs in a song to Lachlan Og Mackinnon attributed to An Aigeannach nighean Dhomhnaill Ghuirm (G, 128), the one composer, whether consciously or not, echoing the other, as often happens in Gaelic verse. In this case we cannot tell which is the echo, as the floruit of An Aigeannach and the identity of Lachlan Og Mackinnon have not been established.

29. cha d’fhuaras: cf. l. 4 n.

38. Another reference to his blindness. Cf. l. 5 n.

39. mac-nan-cliathan: literally, “son of the worms”. The “worm” is the tube in a pot-still from which issues the liquid to be matured into whisky. Cf. JMC, l. 588. The usual kenning for whisky is mac-na-bracha, “son of malt”.

44. cha b’fhiù leat: literally, “it was not worth while with you”. In the present tense chan fhiù has in some dialects (e.g. in Lewis) become cha diù, by confusion of the palatal consonants, with cha bu diù as past tense (for an early example see S, 400); while the phrase cha diù leam has now in Lewis given rise to a noun diùileam, “self-respect”.

49. ràbhartach: see BGh, l. 506 and Glossary. In Lewis a person whose information is unreliable, or who is addicted to telling tall stories, is so described. Cf. TGSI XXXVII, 9. But here the term must be interpreted in a complimentary sense.

[TD 97]

50. ’s taigh-òsd: for anns an taigh-òsd. Cf. ll. 126, 208, 286. This reduction of the preposition plus article is less common now, but is regular in as t-earrach, as t-samhradh, as t-fhoghar, and is to be heard in some dialects with oidhche when telling the time, e.g., deich uairean as t-oidhche.

55. A bride’s dowry (tochradh) was paid principally in cattle, according to the wealth of her parents. The custom was observed even among the poorest classes, at least in outward form; see John L. Buchanan, Travels in the Western Hebrides, 163-165. Cf. Ramsay of Ochtertyre, Scotland and Scotsmen in the Eighteenth Century II, 418-419.

68. There is a reference to France in a similar context by John MacCodrum (JMC, l. 2142). Perhaps France was regarded as the nation which set the highest standards in all the panoply of war. See also DB, l. 2299.

69 ff. This is the conventional catalogue of weapons often found in eulogies of members of the warrior class; and, in particular, it is reminiscent of the song to Lachlan Og Mackinnon cited above (l. 27 n).

72. For better assonance with lasrach in the previous line, perhaps we should read chaiste riut (or ort), i.e., the conditional passive—“who would be turned to (or on) you”—as in Irish. See Séadna, Glossary, s.v. casaim. This usage occurs in Sc. Gael.: e.g., gur niarachd air ’n do chasadh thu, AD, 66. See also BGh, l. 5521.

73. socrach: easily wielded, because of its balance; or, alternatively, hanging easily from the sword-belt.

75. fulangach: able to endure stress or strain. Cf.

<gai>chuireadh am buillean
gu fulang na Spàinnich<eng>
(JMC, ll. 1669-1670).

Similarly, aig fulang, “almost at breaking-point, stretched to the utmost” (North Uist). Traditionally, one test of a well tempered sword was that it could be bent within the circle of a peck measure without breaking. (Morrison’s MS. Traditions of the Western Isles, Vol. 7; PSAS XII (1876–1878), 538.)

78. leum: this special use of the word could be applied with reference to the test mentioned in the previous note. Cf., in the description of the wreck of MacVurich’s galley (Carm. Gad. V, 306) as heard by the writer from the late John MacDonald, Hoebeg, South Uist—leum an clàr-uachdair aiste,

[TD 98]

where the deck of the ship is said to “spring”, a word that is used in English in the same sense.

79. air dhreach na daolaig: i.e., with a polished dark-grey blade. Cf. the adj. glas so often applied to a sword-blade.

86. treud: the picture is of men fleeing in disorder like a herd of animals.

87. greagarra: apparently a variant of greadharra (Dw, s.v.).

89-90. Iain Breac’s sojourn in the Low Country (or England) had lasted nine months (l. 97); but further particulars as to date, etc., are lacking.

93. The difference between faoiltich and fàiltich is usually that the latter, a transitive verb, denotes the act of welcoming, and the former, an intransitive verb, the inward feelings of the one who welcomes. Hence dh’fhàiltich mi e, but dh’fhaoiltich mi ris; chuir mi fàilte air, but rinn mi faoilte ris.

96. mo gheall: it is not clear what kind of wager or forfeit is intended here.

97. See ll. 89-90 n.

100. ar cridhe: note that Gaelic usage, unlike English, favours the singular noun.

104 ff. Tormod: it is clear that this is Iain Breac’s heir, though he is not mentioned in genealogies of the MacLeods, according to which the eldest son was Roderick, who succeeded, and the second son Norman, who succeeded Roderick (MacKenzie, History of the MacLeods, 115). But it is known that Iain Breac had a son and heir who died as a child. There is a portrait of him at Dunvegan. (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 362.) It is to be inferred from the present reference that his name was Norman. Probably he died before the birth of the other son of the same name.

106. air bhuidheachas: translation conjectural. Dwelly has fo bhuidheachas, ann am buidheachas, “in abeyance”, and therefore the idea may be that the boy was the heir apparent, held in readiness to succeed his father. On the other hand, perhaps we should compare tha mi buidheach dhiot, “I am proud of you”, in which case the meaning would be that the boy Norman was the pride of the MacLeods. It is not clear whether the construction is followed by a genitive or a dative, as in this passage Shiol has another noun dependent on it in the genitive, and may therefore by Sc. Gael. usage be left uninflected; if dative, the preposition do (or de?) is to be understood, in its reduced form a.

[TD 99]

107. Cf. the proverb Mac mar an t-athair (NGP, 309); and Fhuaras mac mar an t-athair (SVBDL, l. 969). Also, negatively, Cha bu mhac mar an t-athair e (Rel. Celt. II, 484).

109. an Dùn: Dunvegan Castle.

113. ogha Thormoid: this reference cannot be explained, unless on the assumption that Florence, daughter of Sir James MacDonald of Sleat, was not Iain Breac’s first wife, and that this boy was the issue of a previous marriage, so far undocumented, to a lady whose father’s name was Norman.

115. iarogh’ Ruaidhri: the boy’s great-grandfather was Sir Roderick MacLeod (Ruaidhri Mór), the chief who died in 1626.

117. ogha ’n Eòin: the reference is to John, Iain Breac’s father, and the boy Norman’s grandfather, who succeeded his father Sir Roderick (see previous note), and died in 1649.


FEILL NAN CRANN

The earliest text, headed “Le Ruaraidh Morison air Call a Chraine-ceuil”, is in M (No. 76), and extends to 80 lines (10 verses). It has been printed in MC (pp. 281-283). The text (120 lines) used here, with a few readings from M, was found on some of the blank pages in an interleaved copy of The Beauties of Gaelic Poetry which once belonged to the late Rev. D. M. Campbell, Ph.D., Inverness, and is now in the possession of Mr J. A. MacDonald, Jordanhill College, Glasgow. There are many other insertions on the blank pages of this volume in Dr Campbell’s hand. Dr Campbell (for whom see FES IV, 5) paid several visits to Skye and Uist early this century, and some of the material in this volume, and in other MSS. of his, was doubtless taken down by him from oral tradition on such occasions. He left an extensive collection of Gaelic proverbs to the Gaelic Society of Inverness. See TGSI XLV, 1 ff.

The editor of SO, John MacKenzie, seems to have known this piece, though he did not publish it, and he gives the following account of it in his memoir of the Blind Harper:

During his stay under the hospitable roof of this gentleman [Iain Breac] he [the Harper] composed several beautiful tunes and songs, and, among the rest, that fascinating melody—“Feill nan Crann”, which arose out of the following circumstance: Rory, sitting one day by the kitchen fire, had

[TD 100]

chanced to drop the key of his harp in the ashes which he was raking with his fingers, as M‘Leod’s lady entered and enquired of one of the maids—“Ciod a tha dhith air Ruairidh?” “Mhuire! tha a chrann—chaill e san luath e”, was the reply—“Mata feumair crann eile ’cheannach do Ruairidh”, continued Mrs M‘Leod; and the gifted minstrel, availing himself of the forced or extended meaning of the word crann, forthwith composed the tune, clothing it in words of side-splitting humour, and representing the kitchen maids as ransacking every mercantile booth in the land, to procure him his lost implement! (SO, 86.)


Perhaps, after all, MacKenzie was not very familiar with the contents of the song, which confines the quest for the crann to the island of Barra.

The probable connection of this song with the famous tune known as Craobh nan Teud is discussed in the section on Airs and Metres (pp. 155 ff.).


122. This line is unsatisfactory metrically, and in relation to the music. Perhaps we should read mo chràdh, mo chreuchd, mo chall.

124. mall: unusual as a noun. It may have been a technical term used by harpers about an instrument that was out of tune.

126. ’s tìr: see l. 50 n.

140. an t-sreath: “The manner of Drinking used by the Chief Men of the Isles is called in their language Streah, i.e., a round, for the Company sate in a Circle, the Cup-bearer filled the Drink round to them, and all was drank out, whatever the Liquor was, whether strong or weak” (Martin, A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland, 106.) See also Introduction, p. liii and note 1.

147. d’an còir: see l. 875 n.

153. Baintighearna Mhic Leòid: see l. 113 n.

154. This appears to be a proverbial saying; literally, “It is not a pillaging without pursuit that has befallen you”. Creach represented the stolen cattle and also the act of stealing them, while tòir was the pursuit of the thieves by the owners with the object of recovering the cattle.

168. ged a chosd: for the use of the preterite in place of the past subjunctive and conditional, see TGSI XXVIII, 272. See also l. 967.

169. dhuibh-s’: a good example of the kind of situation in

[TD 101]

which the second person plural pronoun came into use, deferentially, when addressing an individual of superior station.

175. a Barraidh: a topical touch that must have added to the hilarity with which the piece was received by the Harper’s audience; for, in 1675, there had in fact been an expedition from Dunvegan to Barra, and so far from meeting with a friendly reception, the crew had stones thrown and shots fired at them from the battlements of Kishmul Castle, while MacNeil himself was spied at an upper window with a plaid drawn over the lower part of his face! The reason for this unhospitable behaviour was that at the head of the expedition from Skye was a king’s messenger charged with the recovery of debt. The dispute resulted in prolonged litigation. (Justiciary Records: Books of Adjoumal, 3rd June 1678, and 4th July 1682; The Book of Dunvegan I, 180-182.)

176. geall: the wager here is apparently a forfeit to be paid in case the expedition should return empty-handed.

d’a chionn: do + poss. pron. 3 sing. masc. + old dat. sing. of ceann. So also Ir. do chionn, “by reason of, on account of”.

181. nighean Mhic Leòid: one would not expect, having regard to the age of Iain Breac’s other children, that he would have a daughter old enough to serve as one of the crew on the Barra voyage. (But see l. 113 n for the possibility that Iain Breac made an unrecorded first marriage.) It is also surprising that a daughter of MacLeod should be treated in the song on the same level with the kitchen-maids. But it may be that she was an illegitimate daughter. According to the tradition of descendants, Iain Breac had a daughter, believed to be illegitimate, who married Dr Donald Morison, a medical man who was also tacksman of Skinidin, and father of Captain Alexander Morison, who figured prominently in the Ossianic controversy. (For the Morisons, father and son, see Theophilus Insulanus, A Treatise on the Second Sight, 28; Highland Society’s Report on Ossian, Appendix, 175-178.)

182. Nic Neacail: here begins a list of names, all of them, as we have seen, the names of maids serving in MacLeod’s household. It is probable that the full humour of the references could only be appreciated by those who were personally acquainted with them.

183. nighean a’ Ghoill Ghlais: Iain Breac had several men of Lowland origin in his employ, such as his gardener, George Steele (The Book of Dunvegan I, 244 ff.), ancestor of

[TD 102]

the families of that name in Skye. This girl was probably a daughter of James Glass, who was “violer” or fiddler to Iain Breac’s successor, and apparently to Iain Breac also. See Introduction, p. 1 and notes 7, 8.

185. Nic Fhionghain: not further identified, nor are the other maids mentioned in this verse.

189. ’na draip: the more usual form is drip. Cf.

<gai>Tha luchd na foille air an tom
’s am balgshuileach donn ’na dhraip;
cha b’e bhur cairdeas rùin a bh’ann,
ach bhur làmh a bhith tais.<eng>

(The verse is translated: “The false party are on the field, beholding the chief in danger, it was not your love to us, that made you abstain from fighting, but merely your own cowardice”.) (Macintosh, A Collection of Gaelic Proverbs, 1st ed., 5.) Here the form draip is established by rime with tais. Cf. also ’na drip agus ’na draip (Carm. Gad. V, 246).

190. an aoir: cf. the proverb, Fear gealtach ’san aoir.—“A timid man at the mainsheet.” (NGP, 82.) But here the sheet is sgòd (l. 187) and an aoir is the bolt-rope sewn round the edge of the sail.

192. luime luaithe: note the absence of conjunction and copula before the second comparative, as opposed to bu luime ’s bu luaithe—the normal usage, at least to-day. Cf.

<gai>siod na ruidhlichean bu bhinne
bhoidhche mhire dh’éisd mi<eng>
(MT III, 23),—

those were the reels most tuneful
and elegant and spirited that I have heard.

For the lenition of initial consonants in such a series, see DB, xlvi. Cf. l. 1007 n.

193. Nic Mhaol-mhoire: not further identified, but it may be noted that Clann Mhaol-mhoire is what the MacInneses are called in Skye. Of the other maids mentioned in this verse nothing is known, except that nigh’n Domhnaill Ruaidh’s name is given as Meig in l. 235.

198. cur os a cinn: the reference is to sea-sickness. The Harper uses the phrase (cur fos a chinn an taigh an òil) on another occasion; see Introduction, p. liv.

204. Cìosamal: the castle situated on a rock in the harbour of Castlebay, and the seat of the MacNeils of Barra.

[TD 103]

208. as tìr: see l. 50 n.

215. The picture is of young married women rushing on in such haste that they lost their kertches. The kertch (bréid) was a square of linen, folded into a triangle and placed on the head with the long side to the front, that women wore as a sign of the married state.

218. a’ bhùth: presumably some kind of hut in which visitors were put up. Similarly, when great hunting expeditions were organised, “temporary houses or huts” were built in which food was served to the guests (Ramsay of Ochtertyre, Scotland and Scotsmen in the Eighteenth Century II, 404). Compare also the proverb, Nì duine bùth air sgàth na h-aon oidhche (A man will build a hut for the sake of one night’s lodging) (Rel. Celt. II, 504).

223. Literally, “the deceivers have made an opportunity on me”. An unusual construction. One would expect the verb to be ghabh rather than rinn.

226. eang: for a discussion of this word, in its various usages, with examples, see Éigse VI, 61-62.


ORAN MU OIFIGICH ARAID

The only source is F, where the heading is: “An song made be an certain Harper on ye accompt of some officers qo for fear quat their Commissions in K: W: service & pretended to be compond be be [sic] on Gillimichell Mc Donald tinkler as follows”. The song has been transcribed (very accurately, as comparison with a photostat has shown) and transliterated (rather inaccurately) into normal orthography by Malcolm Macfarlane in LSMR, 252 ff. Another transcription of earlier date is that by Alexander Cameron in Rel. Celt. II, 127-132. The heading in Macfarlane’s transliterated version is: “A song made by a certain harper on the account of some officers who, for fear, quitted their commissions in King William’s service; and pretended to be composed by him on Gillemichael MacDonald, tinkler, as follows”. It will be noticed that he substitutes “him” for “be” in the MS.; and in a note (op. cit., 322) justifies this on the ground that “probably ‘he’ was meant for ‘be’; the first letter of the word might pass for either ‘h’ or ‘b’”. The photostat, however, shows that there is no question of any confusion between “h” and “b” in the MS.; so that, going simply on the evidence of

what is written, the natural interpretation would be to suppose that the scribe inadvertently wrote the word “be” twice, and that we should accordingly transliterate, “pretended to be composed by one Gillimichell McDonald”. This interpretation would be quite consistent with the contents of the song, in the first two verses of which we find the author casting himself in the character of a tinker. Added to which is the fact that, if the song were composed about, or addressed to, Gillimichell MacDonald, one might expect to find his name mentioned. But it is not.

On the other hand, the song evoked a reply (ibid., 262 ff.; see Appendix A) from one who obviously understood it to be addressed to Gillimichell, and assumed that character himself. This was none other than the compiler of F, Duncan Macrae of Inverinate (Donnchadh nam Pìos), as is shown by the line bha riamh ri òl a pìosannan (Appendix A, l. 27). Earlier we find the line bhon thubhradh Gille-mìcheil rium (ibid., l. 21), which shows that he understood Gillimichell to be the subject, and not the composer, of the song to which he felt impelled to reply. There is, in addition, the fact that the reply is headed “Gillimichells ansr to the forsaid lyns”. This might be considered conclusive, were it not that considerations to be mentioned hereafter make it look as if Macrae misapprehended the heading of the song when it came to his attention, apparently in manuscript form. If we accept that “be” is written twice the misapprehension must have arisen from his interpreting “on” as “on” instead of as “one”, and then assuming that the name which he would expect to follow “be” had been omitted, inadvertently or otherwise.

Of the song and the reply to it Macfarlane writes: “The late Prof. Mackinnon was of opinion that both of these pieces were of MacRae’s own composition” (op. cit., 345). In fact, Professor Mackinnon considered the possibility that the author of the song “be an certain Harper” might be Roderick Morison (An Clàrsair Dall), but dismissed it on the ground that a verse of it (ll. 249-256) recently recovered in Kintail (by Captain Alexander Matheson, Dornie) was attributed to Duncan Macrae (TGSI XI, 316; Rel. Celt. II, 128 n); which led him to suspect that both the song and the reply were composed by Macrae (TGSI XI, 315-316, 327). This treatment of the question must be considered somewhat inadequate, and it appears desirable to examine the evidence in greater detail.

[TD 105]

Internal evidence in the song—as opposed to the reply—does not take us very far. The reference to the wheel of fortune in the verse beginning at l. 289 recalls the better known lines:

<gai>Chaidh a’ chuibhle mun cuairt,
ghrad thionndaidh gu fuachd am blàths<eng>
(ll. 797-798).

There is also the Blind Harper’s marked propensity for quoting proverbs, of which there is an example in ll. 311-312. Finally, there is the extended eulogy of Maighstir Cailean beginning at l. 361. As shown in the note below, there is reason for supposing that this was Colin MacKenzie, brother of Kenneth, third Earl of Seaforth; and it may be worth remarking that we can trace at least one point of contact which might suggest that he was a friend of the Harper’s family. As demonstrated in Appendix E (p. 207), the Harper’s father was the author of a description of Lewis first published in Sir Robert Sibbald’s Topographical Notices, and it is known that Sibbald obtained the MS. from “Mr. Colin Mackenzie, brother of the Earl of Seaforth” (Geog. Coll. II, xxxii). One further material point is that the date of the song’s composition is fixed as 1689 by the implication (l. 305) that the Revolution had taken place in the previous year (an uiridh). Duncan Macrae began writing his MS in 1688, the date on the first page, and songs of his own composition (“leish i Skripher”) occur, as composed, in their appropriate chronological place and sequence. But this one comes very late, after two items dated 1693. The fact that it was not entered in the MS. at the time of its composition, according to Macrae’s normal practice, is one indication that he was not the author.

The officers whose conduct is castigated in this song had apparently accepted their commissions at the hands of the new king in the belief that submission to him was to be general throughout the country, but had second thoughts when this belief was not borne out by events. Or so the song claims (ll. 305-308). Who were they? The following verse in Duncan Macrae’s reply mentions one of them by name:

<gai>Is ann diubh sin Caiptean Uisdean
a bha cùramach nas leòr
’na ghobharnair glé ùiseil
anns an tùr sin Cùltaigh Leòid;
’s an Ruadhainn ann am Bàideanach

[TD 106]

gum bu shàrfhaclach a ghlòir:
cha chuirteadh nunn e Fhlannrasg
dh’ionnsaigh Fhrangachaibh d’a dheòin<eng>
(F; LSMR, 269).—

One of that number was Captain Hugh
who was conscientious enough
as a much respected governor
in that namely tower Castle Leod;
and in Ruthven in Badenoch
he spoke in well chosen words:
he would not be sent over to Flanders
to attack the French if he could help it.

The officer referred to was Captain Hugh Mackay of Borley. He joined his cousin, General Hugh Mackay of Scourie, with a body of 300 Mackays and a few Rosses, in 1689 shortly before the battle of Killiecrankie. One of the measures taken by General Mackay for the pacification of the Highlands after the collapse of Dundee’s rising was to place 100 Strathnaver men as a garrison in Ruthven Castle under Captain Mackay as constable. General Mackay was engaged in the campaign in Ireland until the summer of 1691, and thereafter went with his Scots Brigade to Holland. (The Book of Mackay, 167, 171, 293.) This was no doubt the juncture at which Captain Hugh Mackay is alleged to have quitted his commission, and other verses in the same piece would lead us to suppose that some of his brother officers, presumably in the above-mentioned force of Mackays and Rosses, also did so.

Resuming the question of authorship, though the song itself provides few clues, it is otherwise with Duncan Macrae’s reply. In the second verse we find that the harper, in his assumed character as a tinker, has as his patron MacLeod (Appendix A, ll. 13-16), and there follows the Christian name of his wife (Catrìona) and his own surname (Mac Mhuirich). It is shown elsewhere that the Blind Harper appears four times in our earliest printed Gaelic anthology as Ruaidhri Mac Mhuirich, and that the Morisons of Lewis and Harris were entitled to be so styled. (See pp. xxxvii, 186.) To complete the proof, there are two references to his blindness. He is spoken of (Appendix A, l. 18) as following his wife (’na lorg), that is to say, being led by her. Then, again, there is the statement (ibid., l. 41) that he cannot see the sweetheart (i.e. the harp) for the love

[TD 107]

of whom he is unfaithful to his wife. These three allusions add up to a total identity that is unmistakeable—that of MacLeod’s Blind Harper, Ruaidhri Mac Mhuirich.

For further proof, if that were necessary, at least one other allusion points in the same direction. It occurs (F; Appendix A, ll. 57-58) in the lines,

A leah sgi dūhird i berihder
Rish i neyre shin hile-faig,

which Macfarlane transliterates,

A leth ’s gu’n dubhairt am bearradair
Ris an earra sin shìol-fàg,

with the assertion that the second line should be translated “to the champion of the leave-behind breed” (LSMR, 265, 322). This can only be considered as extremely unconvincing. The transliteration should be

<gai>A leth ’s gun duirt am beurradair
ris an éighre sin Shìol Phàic’,<eng>

and the translation,

As to what the scathing fellow said
to that heir of Sìol Phàic’.

(For éighre as a variant of oighre, cf. LSMR, 223, 320; OIL, l. 1054 n; JMC, Glossary, s.v. éighreachd.)

Who, then, were Sìol Phàic’? The short answer is that it is Duncan Macrae’s name for the Clan MacLeod. An unprejudiced re-examination of early MacLeod genealogy, with a proper sense of the relative value of sources, is long overdue. A full treatment of the question would not be appropriate in the present context. There are various accounts of the immediate forebears of Leod, eponymous ancestor of the clan. According to the Bannatyne MS., he was a son of Olaf the Black, king of Man (R. C. MacLeod, The MacLeods of Dunvegan, 25-26). Nearly two centuries earlier the Earl of Cromarty makes him a son of Harald, king of Man (Fraser, Earls of Cromartie II, 511), whose name he seems to have met with in Camden’s Britannia (ibid., 510). These unsupported statements, coming from such comparatively late sources, cannot be considered of much value. Earlier sources show a marked unanimity on the question of Leod’s antecedents, though this is obscured by the

[TD 108]

inability of the scribes to copy the unfamiliar Norse names with any degree of accuracy. Cathal Mac Muireadhaigh, writing in the middle of the seventeenth century, gives this version of Leod’s ancestry: Leód mac Olbhuir mhic Raisi mhic Olbhuir (RIA MS. E i 3; Éigse X, 270). MacFirbis, about the same time, writes: Leód mac Gillemuire mhic Raice mhic Olbair (Skene, Celtic Scotland III, 482). In the Kilbride MS. it is: Leód mac Oloig mic Oib mic Oilmoir (ibid., 460). From these sources it is evident that Leod’s great-grandfather was called Olbhair, and probably his father also. The name that concerns us here, however, is that of his grandfather. Oib in the Kilbride MS. is a most improbable form, and must be the result of mistranscription. The other two sources are very close to one another, though the difference illustrates the difficulty experienced by the scribes in dealing with names unfamiliar to them. Raisi and Raice are unrecognisable as they stand, but if Raice is emended to Paice we get a most significant name; for Pàice is the Gaelic form of the Norse personal name Bálki. This name is well attested in Hebridean place-names. Allt Gil Mhic Phàic occurs in the Park district of Lewis, while Tobhta Phàic commemorates a man of that name on the west side of the island at Borve (TGSI XXXVI, 370). In Sleat in Skye there is Dùn Phàic, situated near Kilmore (OSA XVI, 538). But much more to our present purpose is the fact that early in the thirteenth century (1223) Pall Bálkason (i.e., son of Bálki) was Sheriff of Skye (Vice-comes de Sky) in the Norse kingdom of the Isles (The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys, ed. Munch, I, 86, 88, 189). Thus these old genealogies seem to point to the conclusion, obscured by transcribers’ errors, that the MacLeods are descended from this notable Norse family, the eponymous ancestor Leod having been a brother’s son of Pall Bálkason, in Gaelic Pàl mac Phàice. How the idea gained ground that he was a son of Olaf the Black, king of Man, need not be fully investigated at present, except to note that there must have been a relationship on the female side, and that one contributing cause was the erroneous belief that the ancestor Olghair, so frequently celebrated by MacLeod poets and shennachies, and the same as the Olbhair of the genealogical MSS., was to be identified with Olaf the Black, of whom they learnt in passages from the Chronicle of Man printed in Camden’s Britannia. In refutation of this belief it must be sufficient here to state that the Gaelic form of Olaf (ON Oláfr) is, not Olghair, but Amhlaidh (older

[TD 109]

Amhlaoibh), a name conspicuous by its absence from the genealogies, and that Olghair (older Olbhair) stands for ON Olvir, which is the same name as English Oliver.

From the above it will be evident that Duncan Macrae’s Sìol Phàice is of genealogical significance, though most of the clan chose Leod as the eponymous ancestor. However, there is reason to suspect that they and their kin were no more unanimous than many other clans about who was to be given that honour. It is notable that in close proximity to the MacLeods we find MacPhails in North Uist and in the Carloway district of Lewis whose tradition is that they are of the same stock as the MacLeods, and who presumably take their surname from Pall Bálkason. In Lewis, indeed, several families of them have changed their surname from MacPhail to MacLeod in comparatively modern times. Then, again, in the island of Berneray in the Sound of Harris there are a few families of Clann Mhic Phàice, who, for no better reason than that the name Philip begins with the same spirant, are in English called Mackillop (which means “son of Philip”). In the Bannatyne MS. History of the MacLeods, where Leod, though admitted to be his heir, is allowed to have had only a foster-relationship with Pall Bálkason, it is stated that Clann Mhic Phàice are descended from a natural son of Pall, and that at one time they held the island of Berneray and other lands in Harris under the MacLeods (R. C. MacLeod, The MacLeods of Dunvegan, 25). It may be remarked, however, that the imputation of bastardy was a gambit frequently resorted to, especially in a situation in which the senior branch of a clan had lost the leading position to a junior. (Cf. TGSI XXXIX-XL, 210.) Whether or not this happened among the MacLeods, we are left with the impression that by Duncan Macrae’s time they did not relish being classed among the descendants of Pàice, and that this accounts for his choice of nomenclature. He may also have been aware, even at this early date, that they had ambitions to be regarded as the representatives of the former Norse kings of Man and the Isles, and have taken this opportunity of registering dissent.

It is true, as Macfarlane (op. cit., 345) points out, that the song and the reply show such marked similarity of style as to suggest a common authorship. But it must not be overlooked that in the second of the two pieces there is obviously conscious effort to imitate the first, as is shown by the occurrence of

[TD 110]

several “echoing” passages, e.g.,

<gai>’n uair thàr e sàs is éiginn air,
’s ann dh’éirich e gu leòn<eng>
(Appendix A, ll. 99-100; cf. ll. 319-320).

It should also be taken into account that style and language are modified to some degree in the process of oral transmission, and that all the Blind Harper’s songs have been subjected to such a process, including this one, which (assuming that he is the author) must have been taken down from one speaking a dialect other than the Harper’s—that of Wester Ross (ll. 353, 357 and notes).

One argument against the ascription to the Blind Harper would presumably be based on the fact that some unusual words in the song can be paralleled elsewhere in F in pieces believed to be by Duncan Macrae, e.g., breachlamas (l. 329) and breachlam (LSMR, 219); and there are also parallel references to Maighstir Cailean (l. 361; LSMR, 209) and Dàbhaidh (l. 347; LSMR, 231.) If such parallels were to be regarded as significant, we would have to suppose that Macrae was the composer of the song, yet wished to have it ascribed to the Blind Harper. But with what motive? Also, if so, why were some clues leading to the desired ascription not “planted” in the song itself, and not just in the reply?


241 ff. In assuming the character of a ceard (tinker) the Harper may have been influenced by an awareness that at one time the word meant an artist, especially one practising the art of poetry. (Cf. the proverb, Bard is ceard is filidh.) It should also be noted that in his day ceard meant a craftsman in metals, whose work was very similar to that of the smith (gobha), except that the latter restricted himself more or less to iron and to a class of product that did not usually require the same degree of fine workmanship. Both operated in a ceardach, and made use of fire, bellows and anvil.

241. dhom: for the occurrence of this form in Sc. Gael. dialects, from the Aird, through Strathglass, to Kintail, see Henderson, Leabhar nan Gleann, 239-240.

242. ri ’n inneoin: the original s- of the article is invariably preserved following this preposition. As a parallel usage, Macfarlane (LSMR, 322) cites le nach (ibid., 241), which is much less remarkable. It is possible that we should omit dhom

[TD 111]

in the previous line and read:

Séid na builg sin, ghille,
ris an inneoin fair an t-ord.

Another possibility is to omit the article before inneoin. In the two lines there may be a faint hint of the proverb, Faothachadh gille a’ ghobha—bho na h-uird gus na builg.—“The relief of the smith’s lad—from the hammers to the bellows.” (NGP, 178.)

254. giodh: ge with the present indicative of the copula; replaced nowadays by ged as. Cf. l. 1000.

255. The king is William III.

256. The transliteration fallsa in MM and feallsa in Rel. Celt. (II, 128 n) will not do, if only because there must be an assonance with annas in the previous line.

258. as a thòs: literally, “out of its beginning”. See BGh, l. 1760 n, for examples of a similar usage. Cp. air a thos, l. 270 post.

261. The preposition do after thig in this sense is unusual; normally thig … gu.

267. dleasdanach: this gives a better assonance with aite in the next line than dleasanach, which is the form indicated by the MS. spelling. On the other hand, perhaps we should retain dleasanach and read in the next line ’s e ’m Prionnsa b’fhaide leò, “the Prince was of more importance to them”. This idiom is still common in Lewis, e.g., ’s e ’s fhaide leam, “what gives me greater concern”. Cf.

<gai>’s ann thuirt e rium gum b’fhaide leis
mac Raibeirt bhith gun tàilleireachd<eng>
(JMC, ll. 1409-1410).

268. am Prionns’: the Prince of Orange.

273. fàiligeadh: in Lewis now fàilligeadh, not fàil(l)ingeadh as in other dialects.

275. dan: see l. 462 n.

277-280. The idea seems to be that they have become so irresolute that they cannot use their weapons effectively: they could not press home so much as a needle, even if given a blacksmith’s hammer to do it.

286. Cf. l. 50 n.

289-290. Cf. ll. 797-798.

289. àbhartach: MM transliterates amhartach, presumably because of failure to realise that the vowel in stràc in the next

[TD 112]

line, with which there must be assonance, is long, as also in l. 337.

290. Cf.

<gai>gun d’ bhuail a’ chuibhl’ oirnn
an tuinnse teann<eng>
(JMC, ll. 1969-1970).

292. mìltibh: dat. pl. form used as acc. pl. Cf. AMD (1751), where this form is used for nom. and acc. pl. passim. See also LSMR, 297, for other examples in F. Cf. l. 322.

293. geur an aire: the adj. is used adverbially, equal to gu geur.

303-304. Cf. the proverb, Is sleamhain an leac a tha aig dorus an taigh-mhóir. See p. 230, note 40.

306. iad d’an gleus: MM transliterates iad na gleus’, reading ead ni gleise in the MS. But the words, with equal probability, can be transcribed ead in gleise, and transliterated as in the text.

309. duirt: MS. reading represents dubhairt, but the metre requires one syllable. This is the indep. preterite of abair, the form like Ir. (a)dubhairt, due to literary influence; unless, indeed, it survived in the Sc. Gael. vernacular. A duirt e an fhìrinn occurs in some Gaelic dialogue in a story (written c. 1825) in Morrison’s MS. Traditions of the Western Isles, Vol. 9. See also E, 175, I a.

310-312. sionfhacal: note the pronunciation (: chunnalas). This is the pronunciation in Lewis. The proverb seems to be otherwise unrecorded.

314. ’na chòir: the corresponding English phrase, in this special royalist context, is “when the King comes to his own”. Cf. l. 875 n.

322. Cf. l. 292 n.

323. do bhios: an exceptional use of the pre-verbal particle do, in unreduced form, with the relative future.

329. breachlamas: the fact that metre demands antepenultimate stress shows that MS. breaghlims represents three syllables. Cf. breachlam (LSMR, 219).

334. fuath: the MS. reading stands for fuachd, but in the context this can hardly be correct.

347. Dàbhaidh: he is also mentioned in a song composed by a pears’-eaglais (cleric), believed to be an assumed character of Duncan Macrae, in 1692 (LSMR, 231). He was apparently

[TD 113]

David Ross, thirteenth laird of Balnagown. His father had raised a regiment to fight in the Royalist cause and ended his days in the Tower of London after being taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester (1651). In consequence, when he himself came out strongly in favour of the new régime in 1688, becoming Governor of Inverness, and posting garrisons in Brahan and Inverlochy, the Jacobites regarded him as a renegade, and hated him accordingly. It was said that his conduct was that of a weak man, dominated by his wife, a daughter of the Earl of Moray, who in her turn was dominated by the Presbyterian clergy; and there might be some truth in that. It is likely that there is less truth in the numerous scurrilous Gaelic songs about him by members of the Jacobite faction, including one by the Rev. Alexander Cumming, minister of Moy, who, among other details, made him out to be impotent. He was given a nickname, Dàbhaidh Odhar Boireann, which had an equally damaging signification. The Blind Harper’s rude remarks about him (cf. l. 351) are of a piece with this line of vituperation. (Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes I, 63 ff.)

348. ag garadh shràbh: the transliteration in MM will not do, if only because the necessary assonance with Dàbhaidh in the previous line is lacking. The meaning appears to be that when King James is restored to the throne the Laird of Balnagown will no longer have the use of comfortably upholstered furniture, probably with the implication that he will at best be housed in a bare prison cell.

352. The transliteration in MM is faulty in that assonance with the initial vowel of éireas is lacking.

353. bios e: a characteristic feature of Wester Ross dialects is that verbs have an independent future flexion in -s. (See Carl Hj. Borgstrøm, The Dialects of Skye and Ross-shire, 121, 119, 133; TGSI XXIV, 350; XXVIII, 280.) It is not, of course, necessary to attribute this usage to the composer of the song, but only to the person from whom it was taken down before being given to Duncan Macrae apparently in MS., as suggested above.

357. eise: emphatic 3 sg. masc. personal pronoun. Another Wester Ross form. (See Borgstrøm, op. cit., 112.) And still another is coinnidh.

359. gheibh: MS. reading represents gheibheadh, as in MM. But metrical requirements indicate one syllable.

[TD 114]

361. a Mhaighstir Cailean: also mentioned in a song apparently composed by Duncan Macrae (LSMR, 209). He was almost certainly Colin MacKenzie, a younger brother of Kenneth, third Earl of Seaforth. He and his older brother George, afterwards of Kildun, matriculated at King’s College, Aberdeen, in 1655 (Fasti Aberdonenses, 473), and at Edinburgh University in 1656 (MS. Matriculation Roll); and Colin would appear to be the “Colenus McKenyie” who was laureated Master of Arts on 19th July 1661 (Catalogue of Edinburgh Graduates), which is the reason for his being styled Maighstir in the text. His wife was Jean, daughter of Robert Laurie, Dean of Edinburgh, and afterwards Bishop of Brechin (RPC (3rd Series) VIII, 471-472). He was Governor of Eilean Donnan Castle at the time of the Revolution (Warrand, Some MacKenzie Pedigrees, 38). He was zealous in the Jacobite interest, hence the praise accorded to him here. He appears to have been a friend of the Blind Harper’s family. (See p. 105.) See further Alexander MacKenzie, History of the MacKenzies, 275.

377. The transliteration in MM can only be described as extremely fanciful. As Macfarlane himself points out (LSMR, 279), Macrae’s use of the sign of lenition is quite capricious, omitted when it should be there, and vice versa. It is thus quite in order to transliterate Dheoile as déidheil.

384. aos-theud: the first element was a collective noun equivalent to luchd in the Gaelic of to-day. Cf. ll. 679-681 n.

391. thairgeireachd: there are quite a number of variants of this word, including tairgeanachd and dailgneachd. The choice here is determined by the necessity for assonance with farmad in the next line, and is consistent with the MS. reading.

399. The transliteration in MM is at fault as it is not realised that rìgh is in the dative case following the metrically dispensable preposition a (= do), with the result that the next two words are wrongly taken to be adjectives.

400. Cf. tionndadh na boise, “the turning of the palm”, used to signify a moment of time.


A’ CHEUD DI-LUAIN DE’N RAITHE

The text in M’N has only eight verses (96 lines), and is headed “Oran le Ruaruidh Dall air dho Suighichidh an Braigh Lochabair an deigh a chuir e Ferrin Mhic Leoid” (A Song by

[TD 115]

Blind Roderick on settling in Brae Lochaber after being expelled from MacLeod’s estate). The significance of the reference to Lochaber has been pointed out already, and a reason suggested for the idea that the song was composed there (Introduction, p. lxvii). It is clear, at least from the fuller version of seventeen verses (204 lines) preserved in E, that the Blind Harper was still in residence at Totamor (l. 407), and that one of his objects in composing the song was to save his herds from the attentions of the Lochaber cattle-reivers by judiciously combining flattery with pathetic references to his own poverty and blindness. It would appear that this poetic démarche produced the desired effect. As John MacKenzie writes: “When the Harper composed this song, he was residing in Tota-mòr, in Glenelg, as a farmer, and the few of the clans he alludes to were people that he had good reason to fear would rob him, or, in other words, carry away his cattle—a very prevalent practice in those days. As, therefore, he had little or no means of defending himself, he immediately called his harp and his muse to his aid, and composed the song, in which those dreaded enemies are invested with all the attributes of honour, honesty, and good neighbourhood; and, as far as the bard was concerned, they always acted towards him in the characters his muse was willing to believe they actually possessed.” (SO, 89.) That the song was composed in Glenelg is borne out in E, where the heading runs: “Oran le Ruairidh Mac Mhuirich, ’n uair thainig e thamh do Ghleanneilg” (A song by Roderick Morison when he came to live in Glenelg). The reference to the battle of Mulroy in ll. 539 ff., and to Iain Breac as still in life (ll. 436, 457), show that the song was composed between 1688 and 1693.


401. A’ cheud Di-luain de’n ràithe: John MacKenzie describes a custom associated with this particular day as follows: “The Highlanders had a practice in the olden times that is still partially observed in certain parts even at the present day [1841], and that tended to keep alive and fan those habits of hospitality and friendly feelings among the inhabitants of particular districts for which they are so justly celebrated. The custom to which we allude, was to meet at an appointed house, on the first Monday of every quarter, to drink a bumper to the beverage of the succeeding, and wish it better or no worse than the present.” (SO, 87.)

[TD 116]

But, in view of what can be gathered from other sources, we can only conclude that much of the significance of these quarter-days was being forgotten by MacKenzie’s time. There is a hint of more occult practices in the fact that, as Alexander Carmichael was told, the frìth (a form of divination) was performed on the first Monday of the quarter (Carm. Gad. V, 287). Carmichael, in fact, has left a description of these practices in a MS. list of words and expressions, s.v. iubhar: “The yew was sacred in the Highlands and was used not only for making bows but for warding off witches, divining events and safeguarding milk. Iubhar beinne and caorrann, mountain ash or rowan, were burnt on the doorstep of the byre on the first day of the quarter, on Beltane Day and Hallowmas. The byre lintel was sprinkled with wine, or, failing wine, with human urine. A rod of these or some other sacred wood was placed above the lintel. Tar was put behind the ear and below the feaman, tail, of the cows. This was done to safeguard the cattle bho dhosgaidh, bho ealtradh agus bho adhaircean a chéile, mischance, mishap and each other’s horns. A cheese and a churning were made before sunrise to keep the fairies and all uncanny creatures away for the year or for the season.” (Carm. Gad. VI, 92.) Equally significant, taken in connection with the theme of this song, were the measures taken at quarter-day as described in a MS., dated c. 1790, preserved in the Campbell of Inverneill family papers (J. L. Campbell and Derick Thomson, Edward Lhuyd in the Scottish Highlands 1699–1700, 58). Then, again, there is a report from Tiree about the precautions taken there on these dates against the “substance” (toradh) of the milk being taken away by supernatural means (J. Gregorson Campbell, Witchcraft and Second Sight in the Scottish Highlands, 11. And from Lewis we have a saying to the same effect: A’ cheud Di-luain de’n ràithe, latha toirt a mach an toraidh (The first Monday of the quarter, the day for taking away the toradh). See further M. M. Banks, British Calendar Customs: Scotland II, 19-24.

The Harper’s fears for his herds, at least as expressed in the song, were of a rather different kind, but we can see from the above how natural it was that his concern should be expressed at this particular time—probably the beginning of May, for we gather (l. 466) that he is about to send his cattle to their summer pastures in the hills.

404. am ghaoith: see l. 875 n.

[TD 117]

405. a dh’fhiaraich: so also in l. 988. The usual form of this verb in Sc. Gael. is feòraich, but fiaraich is well attested, as in BGh, l. 3911 (and see Glossary, s.v.), where rime is with fhiata, besides being regular in the Kintyre dialect (MacB, s.v.). Ir. fiafruighim.

407. an Tobhta Mhór: the Harper’s residence in Glenelg. The site of the homestead is pointed out near the present school (the Rev. T. M. Murchison in the Stornoway Gazette, issue of 5th March 1957). That the gender is feminine is proved by the fact that assonance demands ì in l. 408, not e, as in SO. See further Appendix B (2).

411. fear-mar-chàch: the phrase is used adjectivally as an adjunct to mi.

413. Fearchar: obviously one of the Harper’s neighbours, but he cannot be identified. In those parts the name Fearchar was originally peculiar to the Maclennans, but by the seventeenth century, on account of intermarriage, it had become common among the Macraes, and to a lesser extent the Mathesons. As there were few, if any, representatives of these clans in Glenelg, the most likely conjecture is that the Harper’s neighbour was a Maclennan. We gather from l. 419 that his wife’s name was Ann.

417. air sgòid: a reference to his blindness. His neighbour leads him, holding him by a loose part of his outer garment.

421. ’s ro-mhath ’n airidh: nowadays is math an airidh is the phrase for “it serves you right”, said to one who suffers deservedly, while is olc an airidh or is bochd an airidh expresses the opposite idea.

432. suanach a’ bhruic: i.e., the quiver covered with badger-skin.

436. ’n fhir bhric: i.e., Iain Breac. Cf. l. 4 n. The reference is important, showing as it does that the Harper was removed to Totamor, Glenelg, during the chiefship of Iain Breac, and not after his death, as has sometimes been stated. The rather subdued, but unmistakeable, tone of complaint in the following two verses leads us to suspect that relations between the Harper and his patron were not as cordial as they once had been. Cf. l. 457. See further Introduction, pp. lvii ff.

444. See Introduction, p. lvii.

447. This is a proverb, one version of which is Is miosa an fhead na ’n éigh, translated “The whistle is worse than the cry”, with the explanation, “The whistle of a thief or cateran”

[TD 118]

(NGP, 279). This explanation would suit the context later on in the song, by way of reference to the Lochaber thieves, but they have not as yet been mentioned. The Harper’s version of the proverb seems to have been Is faide an fhead na ’n éigheach (or possibly éigh). Iain Lom has Leam-s’ is faide an fhead na ’n éighe (OIL, 414). A similar proverb is Théid an osna nas fhaide na ’n éigh.—“The sigh goes farther than the shout”. (Celtic Monthly XVII, 89.) Cf. Dillon, Irish Sagas, 67. But what the precise relevance of such a proverb is in the present context remains uncertain.

451. Clàr Sgìthe: the land, bounds, surface of Skye. For other similar place-names see SVBDL, l. 258 n. Clàr also occurs in place-names other than poetically, e.g., An Clàr Mór and An Clàr Beag, near the boundary of Lewis and Harris. See also ll. 658, 1048 n.

456. an Dùn: see l. 109 n.

457. fhir bhric bhallaich: see l. 436 n.

459-460. Another proverb, the equivalent of English “Out of sight, out of mind”. Fada bho’n t-sùil, fada bho’n chridhe.—“Far from the eye, far from the heart.” (NGP, 174.) An rud a théid fad’ o’n t-sùil, théid fad’ o’n chridhe.—“What goes far from the eye will go far from the heart.” (MacDonald, Gaelic Proverbs, 28.) See also Highland Monthly IV, 645.

462. dam: on the indiscriminate use of do and ag with the verbal noun see Bergin, Stories from Keating’s History of Ireland, 3rd ed., 81. The Harper may have been no more consistent in his usage than Alexander MacDonald (Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair), who, in a MS. written by himself, and in the same song, writes both

O struagh an Car, bhi dar neilidh sdar nar,
dar narmibh dar failidh sdar rúsgidh

and

ach moim agis teicheadh, ann sgach lárich ga fhresdil,
ga bhualidh mar hesich sa chrùn ar

(SGS IV, 153, 154).

Cf. ll. 275, 654.

466. chur a suas: as already pointed out, the reference seems to be to the intention of sending his cattle up to their summer pasturing in the hills. At that time the annual migration to the sheilings (a’ dol chun na h-àirigh, a’ dol imric) was a

[TD 119]

regular feature of pastoral life in the Highlands. See Alexander Carmichael in Skene’s Celtic Scotland III, 385 ff.

467. nan sàrfhear: here begins the Harper’s invocation of those who might be tempted to despoil him of his herds, especially the Lochaber clans, some of whom were the most notorious cattle-thieves in the Highlands, and, if only to be on the safe side, he concludes with some flattering references to clans to the north of him, who were not notable for depredations of this sort. As showing that his fears were well founded, the following excerpt from a letter, dated at Elgin, 25th September 1682, from Kenneth, Earl of Seaforth, to the Lord Chancellor, is of interest: “… we suffer so much by the Lochaber men, that if the King and Council take not an effectual course presently, many of us in that place [Ross-shire] will not have so much of our own as will pay the public dues” (TGSI XVII, 40.)

473-474. The subject of this verse is the Clan Cameron, whose chief was Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel (1629–1719), known in his day as Eóghan Dubh and Eóghan mac Ailein.

485. Clann Mhic Mhaol-onfhaidh: the Camerons of Strone. The Clan Cameron were divided into a number of septs, and it is believed that some of these were not Camerons by ancestry at all. The mere fact of a different surname, however, is not sufficient proof to that effect. Different family groups descended from a common ancestor sometimes took their surnames from different individuals among the descendants of that ancestor; and the fact that the name Mael-anfaidh occurs in the Cameron pedigree in the genealogical MS. of 1467 (Skene, Celtic Scotland III, 479-480) suggests that this sept were kin to the Camerons. Indeed, it would appear that before the epithet Camshron, originally applied to an individual chief, came to be used as the surname of his descendants, the above was the surname by which the clan in general was known, for the section on the Camerons in the same MS. is headed Genelach Clann Maelanfhaigh (Clann Gilla-camsroin) (ibid.). Cf. Celtic Review V, 73 ff. There is no justification for the supposition (TGSI XVII, 32) that this sept were originally Macphees. As a personal name, Maol-onfhaidh survived at least down to the seventeenth century. “Millonachie Cameron” is on record in Murshiarlich, parish of Kilmallie, in 1687 (Commissariot of Argyle: Register of Testaments, 47).

486. oirdheirce: pronounced, rightly, with the epenthetic

[TD 120]

vowel between the first and second syllables, as is shown by assonance with -onfhaidh in the previous line. The appearance of the pronunciation òirdhearc, with long first syllable and no epenthesis, for example in public readings of the Bible, is due to the erroneous idea that the first element is òr (gold), whereas it is the intensive air.

487. shiubhal: the preposition do, reduced to a, and dropping out as a syllable in verse, prefixed to the verbal noun to express purpose, accounts for lenition of the initial consonant of the latter. So also a mharbhadh in the following line.

492. Those whose cattle were stolen usually organised a party to follow the trail in order, if possible, to recover their property. (Cf. l. 154 n.) The Harper, being blind, could not track animals in this way. Nor, of course, could he take part in the fighting which was likely to occur when the thieves were overtaken.

497. sliochd Iain Mhic Mhàrtainn: another sept of the Clan Cameron; and here again we have a suggestion of common ancestry in the fact that the name Gille-màrtainn appears several times in the pedigree of the Camerons in the MS. of 1467 (Skene, loc. cit.). John MacKenzie, in a footnote, calls them “Dochanassie men, a very brave little clan at that time” (SO, 88 n). But they were better known as Clann Mhic Mhàrtainn na Leitreach, the MacMartins of Letterfinlay. The lands held by the family were Letterfinlay, Muccomer and Stronaba, nine merks of land in extent, and forming part of the forty merkland of Dochanassie (TGSI XVII, 38). Iain Mac Mhàrtainn may have been one of the early heads of the family, though there appears to be no record of him. Another possibility is that the reference is to some other family than that of the chief, whom herdmasters had special cause to fear; and it may be worth noting that one of the MacMartins known as Iain mac Iain mhic Dhonnchaidh mhic Iain is on record in 1663 (ibid., 39). On this sept see further Celtic Review V, 71-72.

499. raghainn: the preposition de, reduced to a, is to be supplied.

503-504. Leum an gàrradh far an ìsle e (Leap the dyke where it is lowest) is a well-known proverb, and there are similar ones in other languages. See NGP, 301. Another form is, Far an ìsle ’n gàrradh, ’s ann as fhearr a leum (Where the dyke is lowest is where it’s best to leap it) (Rel. Celt. II, 490).

509. Clann Dubh-shìdh: the Macphees were a broken clan

[TD 121]

at least from the time of the rising of Sir James MacDonald in 1615, after which several of their leaders were executed. But it may be that the break-up began earlier, as a result of the gradual intrusion of the MacDonalds into their ancestral island of Colonsay, which began about the middle of the sixteenth century. (See Clan Donald III, 399-400.) The Macphees who dwelt by the side of Loch Arkaig in Lochaber may represent members of the clan who were displaced at that time. In an account of the Highlands dated c. 1750, and probably written (cf. Origins of the ’45, liii) by the Rev. Alexander MacBean, minister of Inverness, the inhabitants of this district of Lochaber are described as follows: “That part of Lochiel’s estate that runs along the Side of Locharkeg is a Den of Thieves, they are instructed in this Villainous Trade from their Cradles and Hand it down as an Inheritance to Posterity, and tho’ the rest of the Camerons are not so Infamous as the Locharkeg People yet few of them are free from either Theft Receipt or Concealment.” (The Highlands of Scotland in 1750, 83-84.)

521. Clann Mhic Gille-mhaoil: the Macmillans, close neighbours of the Macphees, and, like them, subject of the remarks in the previous note, apparently from the pen of the Rev. Alexander MacBean. They, too, are probably to be regarded as members of a broken clan who found refuge in Lochaber. One of their most notorious robbers at this time was known, from the name of his dwelling-place (A’ Chailleach), as Domhnall Bàn na Caillich. (See MacDonald, Story and Song from Lochness-side, 79, 156; Celtic Monthly IX, 11 n; TGSI VIII, 19; XXXVIII, 215.)

533. Colla: Coll MacDonald, chief of Keppoch, known as Colla nam Bó (Coll of the Cows), a significant name in the present context, though it is stated that he earned it in 1689 by his skill in supplying Viscount Dundee’s army with cattle that had been “driven to the hills out of the way” (Clan Donald II, 648). His mother was a MacMartin of Letterfinlay (idem., III, 421). He was a youth at college when he succeeded his father as chief in December 1682 (Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes I, 11). He died in the third decade of the eighteenth century, after having survived at least three battles in which he distinguished himself—Mulroy, Killiecrankie and Sheriffmuir. (See Clan Donald II, 643-658; III, 421-422.)

539 ff. The Macintoshes were heavily defeated by the MacDonalds of Keppoch, in March 1688, in the battle of

[TD 122]

Mulroy (Latha na Maoile Ruaidhe), when they invaded Lochaber in an attempt to enforce Macintosh’s charter rights by means of the strong arm (Clan Donald II, 644-645). It was the last clan battle fought in the Highlands.

542. ’s gun iad coimeas cheud: M’N has gun sibh coimhlion ceud. Cf. cho fad ’s a bhitheas a choimhlion fear leam ’s a bhitheas ’nam aghaidh, “as long as there are as many with me as there are against me” (The Wizard’s Gillie, ed. J. G. Mackay, 74-75). In the text coimeas is used in the same sense, that is to say, there were not as many hundreds for them as there were against them. It is believed that the Macintoshes numbered about 1,200 men and the MacDonalds about 700 (Clan Donald II, 644, 645).

545. sliochd Cholla: a reference to the MacDonald claim, frequently reiterated by their bards and shennachies, to be descended from the legendary king of Ireland, Colla Uais. See Keating, History of Ireland (Irish Texts Society) II, 356 ff. For the possible grain of truth in this and the true ancestry of the MacDonalds, see SHR XLV, 123-142.

548. an cùis thar an ceann: literally, “their cause over their heads”, i.e., they would not, through faint-heartedness, let events overwhelm them. Cf. BGh, l. 4177.

555. luchd an adhbhair: for the meaning, cf.

<gai>agus òganach loinneil
thuit an adhbhar do loinne<eng>
(OIL, ll. 289-290).

559-560. Few Gaelic words have as many meanings as cliath (f.), primarily a hurdle, and the case is further complicated by the fact that it is not always clearly distinguished from cliabh (m.). The common element in the various meanings of cliath is the notion of a set of more or less parallel lines, in this case the rib-cage. For the sense, cf.

Cha dleise mi breig ra rūitt
Chrijs ta kle mi chūirp
(LSMR, 136);

i.e.,

<gai>Cha dleas mi breug a ràdh riut,
a chridhe-sa ta ’n cléith mo chuirp.<eng>

Professor John Fraser transliterates kle as cléibh, an impossible dat. sg. form of the masc. noun, and is forced to regard it as a genitive (TGSI XXVIII, 465). Cf. cliath (f.), a man’s chest or

[TD 123]

side (Din). The verb tarraing is used presumably in the sense of drawing from a source. See further p. 235, note 80.

563. teud-chluaise: apparently a technical term for the topmost, and shortest, string in the harp, perhaps because it was nearest the player’s ear. But it should be noted that the foremost lower corner of a sail is called cluas (Dw, s.v. bàta), and the rope attached to it taod-cluaise. Cf.

<gai>gun taod oirre, gun taod-cluaise,
cupaill ann am bord an fhuaraidh<eng>
(An Gàidheal V (1876), 49).

It is therefore possible that these usages are parallel, and that cluas may refer to the “angle” of the harp nearest to the player.

566. ’nam airc mu: an unusual construction, but the meaning seems clear . Cf. l. 984 n.

567. tuairgneadh: see l. 850 n.

568. fo ’r mèin: Dw gives exx. s.v. mèinn of a similar usage, but with the preposition an.

569. Gleann Garadh: this may be an example of the place-name being used to denote the man who owns the place, as in the Lowlands of Scotland; but, if so, the usage is quite exceptional in Gaelic. (In the translation it is taken to stand for the inhabitants.) MacDonald of Glengarry would normally be called Mac ’ic Alasdair. The chief at this time was Ranald MacDonald, but, because of his advanced years, the effective leader of the clan, as at Killiecrankie, was Alexander (Alasdair Dubh), his son and heir (Clan Donald II, 450). There is no reason to suppose that the chief of Glengarry himself engaged in the practices feared by the Blind Harper. But the same cannot be said for some of his followers, for example the Kennedy sept, known in Gaelic as Clann Ualraig. (See The Highlands of Scotland in 1750, 106-107.) Then again, there were the men of Knoydart (fir Chnòideart), reckoned to be among the wildest and most lawless in the Highlands. In the description of c. 1750 just cited the author writes: “I came to Knoidart which is a perfect Den of Thieves and Robbers. Glengarry is Proprietor of this Country and it is inhabited by his Clan” (op. cit., 59).

572. a’ chonnspaid ud: literally, “that strife”. Perhaps the reference is to the perennial quarrel with the Campbells. The MacDonalds of Glengarry gave aid to the Macleans when

[TD 124]

they were being harried by the Campbells in the reign of Charles II (Clan Donald II, 448).

577. air reing trithear: three abreast. This was the usual formation for Highlanders on the march (Logan, Scottish Gael I, 153). The form trithear (corresponding to earlier nom. triar) for triùir (earlier dat.) is sometimes met with, e.g.

<gai>iomraidh mise fear mu dhithis,
’s nam b’éiginn domh, fear mu thriùir<eng>

(where instead of thriùir we should read thrithear, for assonance with dithis and penultimate stress) ,—

I shall row one against two,
and if need be, one against three
(An Gàidheal V (1876), 49).

578. This is a proverb. See Rel. Celt. II, 484.

581 ff. The subject of this verse is presumably the Clan Macrae, who were numbered among the following of the MacKenzie chiefs, and were their principal tenants in Kintail. There is no suggestion in the description of the Highlands c. 1750, already cited, that they were cattle-thieves, though otherwise they are dealt with rather harshly. “The Commons here [i.e., in Kintail] are M‘Raes”, the author writes, “and are by far the most Fierce, Warlike, and Strongest Men under Seaforth; but ’till within these 20 years they were little better than Heathens in their Principles, and almost as unclean as Hottentots in their way of living.” He goes on to say that when the Seaforth estate was forfeited after 1715 ministers of the established Church and schools were planted among them, and these measures had made a surprising difference” even in the point of Common Civility Decency and Cleanliness” (op. cit., 31-32). Due allowance must be made, of course, for the fact that, as a Whig and Presbyterian, the writer was a prejudiced, though shrewd, observer.

591. Cf. the proverb, Cha robh coille riamh gun chrìonaich, no linn gun ugh-gluig.—“Never was wood without dry brushwood [recte dead-wood], nor brood without addle-egg”. (NGP, 124.)

593. marcaich na Mòighe: the MacKenzies. The Moy referred to is on the north bank of the River Conon, near the seat of the chief, Brahan Castle. The form here indicates nominative a’ Mhòigh, whereas according to Watson (PNRC, 105) it is a’ Mhuaigh, originally a locative of magh, a plain.

[TD 125]

597. ròiseal: for the various meanings of this word see Carm. Gad. VI, 119-120.

599. beathraichean: pl. of beithir, formed with depalatalisation and syncope.

602. ceann a’ chabraich: i.e., the head of an antlered stag, which is the well known emblem of the MacKenzie clan.


CREACH NA CIADAOIN

The heading in M (104 lines) is “Do Mhac Leoid, le aon do ghillibh fein” (To MacLeod, by one of his own lads); and in E (184 lines) “Cumhadh do Mhac Leòid le Ruairidh Mac Mhuirich” (A Lament for MacLeod by Roderick Morison). SO follows E closely with some variations, mostly not for the better, in individual words.

The occasion of this lament was the death of John MacLeod (Iain Breac) of Dunvegan, which took place in 1693, and, as we learn from the Blind Harper (ll. 612, 692), on Wednesday of Easter week.


620. càilean am fhiacail: a favourite figure to signify discomfort, as in the proverb, Nì càilean am fiacail inntinn loisneach.—“A husk between the teeth disturbs the mind.” (NGP, 333.) Another proverb is, B’e ’n càilean ’san fhiacail e (It is a husk in the tooth) (Rel. Celt. II, 481); and there is also the triad, Trì trioblaidean: deargann ’nam mhuinchill, clach ’nam bhròig, agus càilean ’nam fhiacail (Three torments: a flea in my sleeve, a stone in my shoe, and a husk in my tooth).

623. uthar: perhaps we should read othar, the more usual form, to give an extra assonance—with forthair in the next line.

624. fothair: same as fòir, but two syllables with hiatus.

627. là Càisge: the Blind Harper was living in Glenelg, and the meaning may be that, his friend and patron having died on Wednesday of Easter week, it was on Easter day that the news reached him; or, alternatively, Easter day is normally a day on which to eat and drink with joy, but it was not so on this occasion. Cf.

<gai>Cha b’e sin mo Luan Chàsga
an uair a bhuail an gath bàis thu<eng>
(BGh, ll. 5553-5554),—

That was not my Easter Monday
when the sting of death struck you.

[TD 126]

632. bhuail an t-earrach seo bròg orm: cf. Iain Lom:

<gai>ach a nis on a liath mi
seo a’ bhliadhna bhuail bròg orm<eng>
(OIL, ll. 1980-1981).

For further examples see SGS IX, 84 ff. To be struck on the palm with the sole of a shoe was a forfeit paid by the loser in a game of cards or backgammon (ibid.; Analecta Scotica I, 118).

634. a leus: the 3 sg. masc. possessive is used proleptically, referring to the clause nach beò e.

635. rachadh mi: a notable early example of an analytic form in the 1 sg. conditional of the verb. Still normally rachainn.

641. tursach: the first syllable appears to be short (: furtachd), which is the older form. But in l. 647 it is long (: ùidh), as in Sc. Gael. now.

643. chaochail thu àbhaist: this phrase cannot be interpreted as a reference to Iain Breac’s death, but to a change of attitude on his part while still in life—a change of attitude, presumably, to the Harper. See Introduction, p. lvii.

647. am bith: this was the literary usage; but in Sc. Gael., at any rate to-day, it is ann a bhith.

650. pudhar: cf.

<gai>cha d’ rinn mi fhathast beud no pudhar,
mur do leag mi fiadh fo bhruthach<eng>
(An Gàidheal V (1876), 49),—

I have not yet done scaith or hurt,
apart from bringing down a deer under a bank.

Another form, monosyllabic, is to be heard in North Uist, e.g., cha chuir e pùr ort, “it will not harm you, put you up or down “. Sometimes the article is used:

<gai>ged dhiùlt am bodach fodar dhomh,
’s e siod nach cuir am pùr orm<eng>
(Traditional),—

though the carle refused to give me fodder,
that will not put me out of countenance.

652. chaidh e ’n caisead mo bhruthach: literally, “it has gone into greater degree of steepness, namely, the ascent before me”. The pronoun e is proleptic, referring to mo bhruthach. Abstracts formed from adjectives with the ending -ad have the notion of degree, as opposed to simple abstracts

[TD 127]

formed like the gen. sg. fem. of adjectives (e.g., caise). Cf. ll. 655 n, 1035 n.

654. da dhìreadh: see l. 462 n.

655. airde: see l. 652 n. We should possibly expect airdead, following truimead.

658. Clàr Sgìthe: see ll. 451 n, 1048 n.

659. ’sna Hearadh: Iain Breac, according to histories of the family, was buried in Inverness (R. C. MacLeod, The MacLeods of Dunvegan, 169; I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 318-319). But the evidence adduced falls short of proof. According to this passage, and its author should know, he was buried in Harris, presumably in St Clement’s, Rodil, with his ancestor Alasdair Crotach. There is another lament for Iain Breac which also states that he was buried in Harris. See Introduction, pp. li-lii.

664. mnài caointeach: the mourning women, some of them professional mourners, whose part at a funeral was to express their grief, often very violently, and to praise the deceased, which they did ex tempore, in short unrelated ejaculations, frequently couched in verse. See JMC, ll. 1297 ff. and note. Perhaps we should read mnài caointe (keening women), where caointe is the genitive of the verbal noun.

667-668. These lines indicate that the Harper travelled from Glenelg to attend Iain Breac’s funeral.

671. fuil bhrùite: the latter word is the genitive of the verbal noun, not the past participle (cf. l. 664 n), so that the literal meaning is “blood of bruising”, i.e., extravasated blood.

673. Cf. l. 3 n.

679-681. ceann-uidhe luchd ealaidh: the phrase is echoed by Mary MacLeod (GSMM, l. 631). We cannot be sure whether the terms luchd ealaidh, luchd seanchais and aosdàna are to be understood as having a precise meaning whereby three classes of persons are being differentiated, but it looks like it. (Cf. Airs and Metres, pp. 149 ff.) By luchd ealaidh is probably meant singers and also often composers of songs (amhrain), who would normally be musical instrumentalists (like the Harper himself); luchd seanchais would be historians, and perhaps also story-tellers; and the term aos-dàna probably denotes the serious poets, whose duty it was to celebrate great men and great deeds in eulogy and elegy, whether in the literary language or in the vernacular. It is notable that aos-dàna is here a collective noun, which is what it ought to be, in

[TD 128]

contrast to the peculiar usage elsewhere in Sc. Gael. whereby a single poet is called an t-aos-dàna. See Armstrong’s Dictionary, s.v. aois-dàna. See also aos-theud (l. 384 n).

682. aimcheist: a variant of imcheist. At the beginning of one of Mary MacLeod’s songs the assonance similarly demands that we should read, with E:

<gai>Is mi am shuidh’ air an tulaich
fo mhulad ’s fo aimcheist,
is mi ag coimhead air Ile,
is ann de m’iongnadh ’san ama seo.<eng>

The letter in italics in the last line represents an epenthetic vowel. (E, 107; cp. GSMM, ll. 387-390.)

686-688. These lines apparently mean that, when very young, the Blind Harper belonged to a band (treud) of strolling minstrels. The recollection comes to him as a result of his reference to luchd ealaidh, etc., in the previous verse (ll. 679-681 n). It would appear that his relations with his companions of the road were not too happy; perhaps it was the difficulty of accommodating himself, as a gentleman’s son and a man of education, to such a way of life. In any case the thought is seemingly now borne in on him that, but for his fortunate meeting with Iain Breac, separation (tearbadh) from such picaresque associates might not have been possible. See further Introduction, pp. xlii ff.

691. an ùrghibht: one of the songs of Mary MacLeod, of which the music is extant, but not the words, began, Tha mo chion air an ùrghibht. The subject was apparently Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan, born after his father’s death in 1706. (TGSI XLI, 16 ff.)

692. seachdain na Ceusda: similarly Good Friday is Dihaoine na Ceusda, where Ceusda is the genitive of the verbal noun ceusadh. In this particular context ceusadh is fem., though otherwise masc. In Irish it is masc., including this context, e.g., Aoine (an) Chéasta (Din).

695. iuchair: a favourite figure to characterise a Gaelic chief, who might be described as a key to wealth, to wisdom, to the understanding of poetry, to the love of women, etc. See BGh, Glossary, s.v., for examples.

703-704. The reference is to the proverb, Is e goirteas a chinn féin a ghearaineas gach duine (It is the ache in his own head that every man bewails) (Rel. Celt. II, 495).

[TD 129]

715. Màiri: Iain Breac had a number of sisters. Mary married, first, Sir James MacDonald of Sleat, and, second, Mure of Rowallan (Alexander MacKenzie, History of the MacLeods, 99).

716. chuir … an tasgaidh: literally, “put … away in a safe place”. This is also the meaning of the verb taisg, which in Lewis has the additional special meaning of putting the fire away safely for the night, i.e., “smooring” it. But elsewhere the word for this is smàl.

720. The Harper seems to be in error here. It was Maolciarain who lamented the death of his son Fearchar, slain while making a poetic circuit (cuairt) of Ireland. The poem composed upon him by his father was better remembered than any other similar poem in the literary language, and is referred to repeatedly in vernacular Gaelic verse, e.g., by Iain mac Thearlaich Oig (GB II, 195) and John MacCodrum (JMC, l. 2326). See BGh, l. 3676 n, for further citations. A Scottish version of the poem has been preserved (Rel. Celt. II, 332). Cf. Knott, Introduction to Irish Syllabic Poetry, 96-97. For a poem by Fearchar Ó Maoilchiaráin see O’Rahilly, Dánta Grádha, No. 14. For another, ascribed to him in one source, see O’Rahilly, Measgra Dánta, No. 75.

724. In this line the Harper is presumably harking back to the time when Iain Breac relieved him in his distress by becoming his patron.

729-730. It would appear that either gnàthaicht’ or fìor is not the correct reading, as assonance is lacking.

729-732. The proverb alluded to here is Cha robh meadhail mhór riamh gun dubh-bhròn ’na déidh.—“Never was great merrymaking but was followed by blackest sorrow.” (Cf. NGP, 125.) There is a similar reference in John MacCodrum’s line, thàinig meadhail gu bròn duinn (JMC, l. 2229).

731. dh’a meud: for this idiomatic use of the preposition de see BGh, l. 1425; GSMM, l. 564 n.

735-736. There is a traditional story that must have suggested the thought in these two lines. A woman whose husband, brother and son were in prison was allowed to choose one of the three who was to be liberated and have his life spared. She made her choice in the following verse:

<gai>Ma bhios mi beò, beirim mac;
gheibh mi fear ged nach co-dheas;

[TD 130]

o ’s i mo mhàthair nach beir mac,
is e mo bhràthair mo raghainn.—<eng>

If I am spared I will bear a son;
I will get a husband, though not as good;
since it is my mother who will not bear a son,
my brother is my choice.

It is said that her words resulted in the release of all three. (Macintosh, Gaelic Proverbs, 1st ed., 71; NGP, 391.) See further Éigse I, 236; II, 24; VI, 181; DG XIV, 111.

738. a dhùbladh: the preposition a (= do) with the verbal noun to express a wish. See BGh, ll. 6939-6941 n. The figure refers to some card game. Cf.

<gai>ar n-aon ’s ar cairt dhùbailt,
’s an crùn air an tàileasg<eng>
(JMC, ll. 1505-1506).

745 ff. Iain Breac’s eldest son was apparently called Norman, and for him the Harper had the highest regard. But he died before his father. (See ll. 104 ff. and note.) The next son Roderick was his father’s heir, and for him the Harper seems to have conceived an antipathy which is barely concealed in these verses. See notes on Oran do Mhac Leòid Dhùn Bheagain (pp. 133 ff.); and Introduction, lviii.

749. Ruaidhri: this is Sir Roderick MacLeod of Dunvegan (Ruaidhri Mór) who died in 1626, as is shown by the fact that he is called young MacLeod’s great-grandfather in l. 751.

753. Ruaidhri … ’na dheaghaidh: this must be Sir Roderick MacLeod of Talisker, second son of Ruaidhri Mór above. He was knighted after the Restoration for his services to the Royalist cause during the Commonwealth. He died in 1675.

754. tàire: as an adj., tàir seems to occur in Sc. Gael. only in the comparative, as here. See RIA Contribb s.v. 1. tàir.

755. an treas Ruaidhri: Roderick MacLeod of Dunvegan, son of John MacLeod of Dunvegan, and grandson of Ruaidhri Mór. He was young MacLeod’s uncle.

fa dheireadh: fo dheireadh now in Lewis; elsewhere mu dheireadh. Ir. fá dheireadh.

762. an ceathramh Ruaidhri: young MacLeod, who has now succeeded as chief, and who stands in need of some good advice—or so the Harper apparently thinks.

[TD 131]

771. This seems to be another reference to some proverbial saying.

780-784. The subject of these four lines is Iain Breac, who is compared to the fruitful branch of a tree, perhaps the commonest metaphor for a chief in Gaelic encomiastic verse, in both the literary language and the vernacular. Cf. GSMM, xxv.

785. bu chathair: same as bu chòir, or rather bu chàir, with hiatus. Though the latter form does not seem to occur in Sc. Gael., cáir was an alternative form of cóir in the literary language (TD I, lxvi). Also the comparative càra is still to be heard in Lewis in such phrases as bu chàra dhut, “you ought rather”. Cf. Is cathar mi na gach neach, translated “More victorious am I than all persons” (Carm. Gad. I, 54-55). But, as the words occur in an “Invocation for Justice”, it is more likely that cathar is a comparative of còir, and that the meaning is, “More just am I than all persons”.


ORAN DO MHAC LEOID DHUN BHEAGAIN

In T there is no heading or ascription. The heading in E is “Oran do dh’ Eoin breac Mac Leòid no Hearadh; le Ruairidh Mac Mhuirich”; and in SO it is “Oran Mor MhicLeoid. (Eadar an Clarsair agus Mac-talla).” In DC the beginning is at the top of p. 19 in Vol. I (the larger octavo volume) without any heading, but at the top of p. 21 is written “Oban [sic] le Ruairidh Mac Illemhoire a Clarsa[ir] dall do Mhac Leoed Dunbheagain”. In GB the heading is “Oran Mor Mhic-Leoid. Leis a Chlarsair Dall”; and in MT it is “Oran do Mhac Leòid Dhun Bheagain leis a’ Chlarsair Dhall”.

The heading in E is erroneous. The song is addressed, not to Iain Breac, but to his son, though there is much harking back to the father by way of example and rebuke to the son. The name Oran Mór Mhic Leòid seems to have been first used by the editor of SO, and is rather misleading, both because the genitive case, on one interpretation, might mean that MacLeod was, not the subject, but the author of the song, and also because it may have led to a belief that òran mór was a technical term for a certain class of song, which is not the case—òran was, but not òran mór.

Still another name is found in the Angus Fraser MS. of Gaelic music in Edinburgh University Library, where one set

[TD 132]

of the air (see p. 160), given as No. 63 in Part 2, is called “Far-fhuadach a’ Chlàrsair (The Harper’s Banishment)”. In the latest history of the MacLeods we are informed that “when Rory Og succeeded his father Iain Breac as chief he dismissed Rory Dall” (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 330); and there does seem to have been a widespread belief that the song was composed when the Harper was removed from Dunvegan to Glenelg, or, alternatively, when he was removed from the MacLeod estate altogether. Indeed, the editor of SO lent the weight of his authority to this latter idea when he wrote (p. 86): “This last song was composed after his ejectment from his farm, and while on his way to his native Isle of Lewis”. But, as is shown elsewhere, the idea is without foundation; nor was this his last song; nor did he retire to the Isle of Lewis. (See Introduction, pp. xxxviii, lvi-lvii, lxvii; and p. 146.)

The texts supplied in GB and MT have to be handled with care. It is clear that they derive to a great extent from OGS, though there are indications that use was made of other (including possibly traditional) sources, and, particularly in MT, that the editor did not scruple to rewrite some lines himself.

A curious feature of the various texts of the song is that the two earliest, T and E, are much shorter than other texts first written down a good deal later; and there is cause to suspect that in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century there was a certain fear of giving offence, not only to the MacLeods, but also to others who betrayed their trust as chiefs and ruined themselves by behaving in the manner so scathingly described in the verses omitted. The career of Ranald George (1788–1873), twentieth chief of Clan Ranald, and, indeed, of some later chiefs of the MacLeods, might be cited in order to point the moral of the Harper’s tale. On the other hand, it is said that there were some of this class who took the Harper’s words to heart. John MacKenzie tells us that the song was “a favourite with Sir Alexander M‘Kenzie, of Gairloch, who paid a person to sing it to him every Christmas night. One of Sir Alexander’s tenants went to him one day to seek a lease of a certain farm. The laird desired him to sit down and sing Oran Mòr Mhic-Leòid till he should write the document. The tenant remarked that he certainly set great value on that song. ‘Yes’, was the reply, ‘and I am sorry that every Highland laird has not the same regard for it.’” (SO, 93 n.) Yet John MacKenzie also published only the attenuated text of the song,

[TD 133]

although he was acquainted with most of the rest of it. He writes: “Eight stanzas of this song are purposely omitted, as we think their insertion would be an outrage on our reader’s sense of propriety”. (Ibid.) This consideration could be held to apply much more appropriately to certain songs which MacKenzie did insert, and we can only suppose that he too was a victim of the fear already mentioned. Perhaps Sir Alexander MacKenzie of Gairloch was allowed to hear only an expurgated version after all.

The Blind Harper’s severe criticism of the young chief of the MacLeods has been called “very spiteful” (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 330). It is possible that personal spite was an element in the situation, but we cannot dismiss the matter as easily as that; there are questions to be asked, and answered as far as the evidence permits. On the Harper’s side, was he motivated by self-interest in assailing a chief who did not treat him with the same liberality as his predecessor (though, as we have seen, there is no reason to suppose that he removed him from his lands), or are we to regard him as a patriotic Gael, angered at a new phenomenon, the “absentee landlord”, neglecting his estate and wasting his substance in aping the manners and style of living of aliens? On the young chief’s side, we should like to know more about his exact age and state of health. The Harper admits that he was young (l. 768), but, on the other hand, the exhortation to forswear childish ways (l. 766) makes sense only on the assumption that he was old enough to pay attention and profit from such advice—old enough also, apparently, for the Harper to have already entertained doubts as to his strength of character. That he was not a minor, at least for long after his father’s death, is suggested by the fact that no tutor was appointed to administer the estate. There is a letter of his to his father, dated at Edinburgh, 23rd August 1690, stating that he could not enter college “for reason of the tumults and confusion” (The Book of Dunvegan I, 132). At that time students could be enrolled at the Scottish universities at the age of fourteen or fifteen, but he may have been somewhat older. On the question of his state of health, it is true that he died of consumption (I. F. Grant, op. cit., 341), and it might be tempting for his defenders to picture the Harper making a cruel attack on a dying boy. But his death did not take place until 1699 (ibid.), and there seems to be no proof that he was in poor health during the whole of the six years

[TD 134]

following his father’s death. The Harper’s account of his activities would rather suggest the contrary. The consumption could have been brought on by various causes, including a dissolute life, but there is no proof of that either.

It has to be said in the young chief’s favour that in the letter which gives us the above particulars as to the date and cause of his death his tutor, the celebrated Martin Martin, writes of him, “He was the kindest friend I had on earth” (ibid.). This may well be true of his private character among his intimate friends. But the Harper is more concerned with his public performance as chief and father of his people, as a landowner in the administration of his affairs and relations with his tenants, as a man who ought to be a patron of the native arts—and, be it added, simply as a Gael. Certainly the strictures on his extravagance are amply borne out by the record evidence. It has been estimated that during the few years he was chief he increased the burden of debt on the estate by £45,000, despite the fact that his free annual income is reckoned to have been about £9,000 (The Book of Dunvegan I, 267). The cheerful irresponsibility with which he would append his name to a bond (bann) in order to extricate himself from his more immediate embarrassments is another trait strongly underlined by the Harper (l. 964), and for proof there is a large bundle of such documents in the muniment room of Dunvegan Castle, which show that he “borrowed all round from tacksmen, the minister, and even employees such as the mason and the forester” (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 348).

It is only just to point out that, as far as we know, young MacLeod did not take any positive action against the Harper, even after the composition of this song. (See Appendix A, l. 59 n.) He probably did not give him any tokens of his favour, but he was under no obligation to do so, as the Harper, contrary to what has so often been supposed, had no official status in the chief’s household. His association with Iain Breac had been a purely personal arrangement whereby that chief took him under his patronage. (See Introduction, p. xlix.) Those who did have official status, like the O’Muirgheasain poets and the MacCrimmon pipers, were maintained after the death of Iain Breac in the usual way (I. F. Grant, op. cit., 330). We may well suspect, however, that the young chief took no interest in such matters, and that the credit should go, not to him, but to his factor. Whether he ever heard of the Harper’s bitter

[TD 135]

criticism of him, or had enough Gaelic to understand it, we do not know. If he did, it is certainly to his credit that there is no hint of retributive action, and that the Harper does not appear to have had to leave the MacLeod estate until after his death.

It looks as if Duncan Macrae of Inverinate (Donnchadh nam Pìos) is referring to this song in the lines:

<gai>A leth ’s gun duirt am beurradair
ris an éighre sin Shìol Phàic’<eng>
(Appendix A, ll. 29-30; p. 107 ante).

True, the latest date given for any of the contents of F is 1693 (LSMR, 232, 238), but the items in the latter part of the MS. seem to be arranged in chronological order, and the lines quoted appear several pages after mention of that year, in fact, in the last piece of all. It is therefore quite possible that they were composed after the Blind Harper’s castigation of the young chief in Oran do Mhac Leòid Dhùn Bheagain had come to Macrae’s notice. The less likely alternative would be to suppose that the Harper had at an earlier date directed another tirade against MacLeod which is now lost. The term éighre (heir) used by Macrae might suggest that this happened while his father was still alive, but not necessarily so.

The song is in the form of a dialogue between the Harper and Echo (Mac-alla), lamenting the glories that have departed from Dunvegan since the death of Iain Breac in 1693, and contrasting the latter’s behaviour as chief with that of his errant son.


789-790. In the first couplet, as sometimes happens at the beginning of a song, the full pattern of assonances more or less strictly observed thereafter is not established. It may be that there is a different pattern, with miad meant to assonate with chliabh, though the fact that miad does not carry a main stress makes this doubtful. See further Airs and Metres, p. 162.

790. co: with unlenited initial consonant, which is the older usage found, e.g., in the earlier editions of the Gaelic Bible. See DB, xlv.

791. rinneas: cf. l. 4 n.

795. a mhic athar mo ghriàdh: a pointed expression, indicating love for the father only. Mary MacLeod, in an equally marked manner, addresses him as a mhic athar mo rùin (Craig, Orain Luaidh, 38; TGSI XLI, 23; XLV, 166).

[TD 136]

796. ’s tu m’olc: something of a paradox, in view of what comes before. The reading in MT is an unconvincing attempt to get over the difficulty, and is doubtless to be ascribed to the editor. It is much better, in view of the unanimity of the other sources, to let the line stand as an expression of the conflicting thoughts in the Harper’s mind.

797. Cf. ll. 289-290; l. 290 n.

800. Dùn ratha: Dunvegan; and so also subsequent references to an Dùn. BGh reads, with T, Dùn ratha nam buadh seo thràigh, and translates, “I myself on a time (uair) have seen this stronghold, which has now decayed, an abode of gracious affluence and excellence” (op. cit., l. 4362 n).

805. Mac-alla: so in T, the earliest source. The form Mac-talla no doubt derives from erroneous association with talla, a hall, when in fact the second element is all, a cliff (MacB).

811. Although the line is feasible as it stands, it is rather overweighted with long syllables, and it may be that gun chuirm should be omitted.

819. chunnaigheas: an unusual form, presumably 1 sg. pret. indep. of faic. Cf. l. 4 n.

824. aithris air: see l. 1012 n.

834. organach: small organs were imported from Germany in the seventeenth century. These are often referred to as orgain Lìteach, no doubt because that was their port of entry into Scotland. See OIL, l. 165 n.

838. téaghlach: with vowel of first syllable pronounced so as to assonate with é- in éirigh in l. 837. Similarly, gléadhraich: céile in the next two lines.

840. an céile: perhaps the meaning is “their spouse” (i.e., of the drones). As the pronoun i in the next line refers to céile—a feminine noun, as it sometimes is, or personified as a female—it seems clear, from the description of it “taking its fill” that céile (sc. nan dos) is the bag (màl) of the bagpipe. So also apparently in the following lines:

<gai>’s pìob gu fonnmhor ’ga gleusadh
aig a céile fo achlais<eng>
(Clàrsach na Coille, 121),—

and a pipe being melodiously tuned
by its partner held under the oxter.

[TD 137]

But it is possible that here the céile is the piper, and that we should translate “under his oxter”, so that, if the lines “echo” the Blind Harper, his meaning has not been understood.

air a cois: “afoot”, i.e., up out of bed in the morning.

o’n t-suain: a peculiar usage. The idea may be that, like the household, the céile has just been aroused from sleep. But the use of the article is odd, and requires explanation.

843. chionalta: this is the Lewis form of cheanalta, and is established here by the need for assonance with dhrithleannach.

844. dhìonach: literally, “air-tight”. A good piper, when that is his intention, covers the holes in the chanter so that the flow of air is completely occluded. The implication is that an unskilful piper can not be depended on to do so. This emerges clearly in the lines:

<gai>throimh na tuill fhiara
nach dìonaich na meòirean,—<eng>

through the squint holes
that the fingers cannot cover
(JMC, ll. 974-975, and trans.).

See also BGh, Glossary, s.v. dìonach.

845. an rianadair: the piper, as is shown by the fact that he is spoken of as compressing the bag. That an is the possessive pronoun, and not the article, is indicated by its recurrence in l. 847. So also probably in l. 849. The piper was no doubt Patrick MacCrimmon (Pàdruig Og). See Introduction, p. 1.

846. cur a dh’fhiachaibh: cf.

<gai>ri cur am fiachaibh gu bheil ’san tìr seo
gach nì as prìseile tha fo’n ghréin<eng>
(BGh, ll. 413-414),—

representing that there is in this land
everything that is most precious under the sun.

Note the difference of preposition—de in the text and an above.

850. thuairgneadh: finite forms of this verb are rare in Sc.G.; but the v.n. tuairgneadh (cf. l. 567) still has a certain currency in relation to “mental or spiritual anguish”. The stem (2 sg. impv.), if it existed in Sc.G., would presumably be tuargain, corresponding to E.Ir. túarcon, v.n. of do-fúairc, “grinds, crushes; beats, pounds, buffets” (RIA Contribb, s.v.). See also Din, s.v. tuairgnim.

[TD 138]

851. cur a thagradh an cruas: cf., as an earlier example:

<gai>’s tric chuir a thagradh an cruas
’n cluais an daimh chabraich an sàs,—<eng>

often has he firmly planted his plea
[i.e., established his claim]
fast in the ear of the antlered stag
(BGh, ll. 6741-6742 n).

852. le h-aideachadh: cf.

<gai>a’ stad ’s ag aideachadh gu h-eòlach,—<eng>

ceasing their song, and skilfully declaring
(BGh, l. 4954, 4421 n).

The word may also carry the notion of the musical instrument “responding” to the player’s efforts. The notion of response seems to be implicit in the phrase dh’aidich i, said of a heavy boulder when it has “budged” as a result of efforts to dislodge it. Cf. Father Allan McDonald, Gaelic Words and Expressions, 21.

854. ’na fardaich: the reference is presumably to the receptacle in which the bagpipe was kept when not in use.

856. gàir nan teud: a reminiscence of the Harper’s own playing, and probably of visiting harpers as well. Note the order: piping first and harping afterwards, which was the order at a feast. The bagpipe was played during the meal, and the harp after the meal was over. (See Introduction, p. liii.)

860. lùthadh: the literal meaning is “spring”, and it may be noted (without suggesting any connection) that this English word also can have a musical connotation. A shorter form is lùth, which is a term common to harp music and the great music (ceòl mór) of the bagpipe. In the latter connection it appears erroneously (because of confusion with the adjective luath, fast) as luath, e.g., crùnluath, taorluath, etc. Alexander MacDonald has the following s.v. clialú: “clialú (among pipers) is that division of a pipe-spring, so called, because the nine fingers are at once in the quickest motion playing it” (AMD (1751), 205 b); properly cliath-lùth.

862. teasdadh: literally, “failing, dying”.

863. mu’n chlàr: the reference is to the chequered board used in the game described in the note on ll. 865 ff.

864. ghnàth: prefixed to the verbal noun in an adverbial

[TD 139]

sense, as, for example, sìor is in Sc. Gael., here with initial consonant lenited after the possessive. Cf. ghrad thionndaidh (l. 798), where the adj. is similarly used with the preterite.

865 ff. dà chomhairleach, etc.: the game was probably backgammon, which was called “tables” until the seventeenth century. Martin Martin gives an account of this game as played in the Blind Harper’s day: “Sir Normand Mack Leod, and some others playing at Tables, at a game called in Irish Falmer-more [falmair mór], wherein there are three of a side, and each of them throw the Dice by turns …” (Description, 320). There were two dice, thrown together, the throw determining what moves were open to the player, having regard to the position on the board. They must be the “two counsellors” (dà chomhairleach). The loud clamour made by them (ge b’ard an glòir) was doubtless the rattling of the dice in the dice-box before each throw.

868. do dhaoine gun fhuil, gun fheòil: i.e., the “men” on the board. But it is possible that do should be read as equivalent to de, the two prepositions being usually indistinguishable phonetically in Sc. Gael. In that case the reference would be to the dice, and the translation would be “considering that they were men without flesh or blood”.

870. cur ri: the meaning is the same as simple ri followed by the verbal noun, but stronger, so that it can be translated “engaged in”, or even “busily engaged in”. See also l. 900. Cf.

<gai>’n uair bhiodh càch cur ri gnìomhadh
bhiodh mo chuid-sa dheth dìomhaoin<eng>
(OIL, ll. 1314-1315).

875. fear-bogha: a “bow-man”, i.e., a fiddler, who supplied music for dancing. See Introduction, p. 1; and l. 183 n.

’nan còir: the basic meaning is “in their rightful share, territory”, hence “in their presence, near them” (cf. MacB, s.v.). The noun còir governed by prep. an has sometimes been explained as a syncopated form of comhair, but erroneously; see T. F. O’Rahilly in Celtica I, 349-351. For a more specialised meaning see l. 314 n. Cf. (’n)am ghaoith (l. 404), literally “in my wind”, perhaps originally used in a hunting context.

882. fear-comuinn: note idiomatic use of the singular. Cf.

[TD 140]

<gai>is ’n uair a shloinneadh an cairdeas
b’i féin ’s mo mhàthair an t-iarogh’<eng>
(UB, 186),—

and when kinship was worked out
she and my mother were second cousins.

Possibly we should read fear-comain. Cf. Carm. Gad. VI, 47, s.v. comain.

889. ’na fhasadh: it cannot be ’na fhàsach, which seems to be the reading intended in the sources, as assonance is required with fhaca in the next line. Cf. l. 895 n.

892. taighteir: the term (< L. tutor; E. tutor) applied to a leading clansman chosen, during the minority of a chief, to be his guardian, administer his affairs, and act for the time as head of the clan. Thus, on the death of John MacLeod of Dunvegan in 1649, while his son Roderick was still a minor, the latter’s uncle, Sir Roderick MacLeod of Talisker, was appointed tutor, a fact no doubt well known to the Blind Harper. The meaning is that at no time previously had Dunvegan been without a chief, or at least a tutor, in residence to hold court there. The reference is not, as has been stated (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 330), to the appointment of Alexander MacLeod, of the Berneray family, living in Edinburgh, by Roderick to act as tutor during the minority of Norman, his brother and heir.

895. fasadh: cf. l. 889 n. Here the assonance is with tha e in the next line, where the vowel in tha is short in unstressed position.

898. òg-thighearna: in view of the lack of assonance with a syllable in the interior of the previous line, perhaps we should read oighre òg (: taighteir).

900. luchd chleòc: by way of contrast to the Highland garb. The reference is to Lowland townsfolk and/or to court life in London. Cf.

<gai>Ho ró gur fada
’s cian fada gu leòr
o’n là chaidh thu air thurus
do bhaile Lunnainn nan cleòc<eng>
(OIL, ll. 1876-1879);

Gur fada leam an Sasann thu
’s a bhith ’gad chreach le spòrs;
b’fhearr leam còt’ is breacan ort
na pasbhin chur air cleòc
(Ibid., ll. 1566-1569).

[TD 141]

902. a: the reduced form of the pre-verbal particle do.

sìon: not often met with in such sources as this in the sense of “anything”. But common in colloquial speech, especially with negatives, e.g., chan ’eil sìon, and in the phrase a h-uile sìon, “everything”.

908. maor: an official of any kind (< L. major). On Highland estates it was the term for the ground-officer, who worked, one in each barony or district, under the direction of the factor as his deputy in carrying out his instructions and attending to lesser routine duties. In the present context, however, the reference must be to the bailiffs, seizing the property of a bankrupt.

911. sonas: in view of the absence of an assonance with a syllable in the next line, we might read sulas (: uireasbhuidh). Cf. OIL, l. 904.

913-916. Having regard to the pattern of assonances occurring in other verses, these lines should possibly read:

ann an daor chùirt nan Gall,
ged bu chaomh leis bhith ann ri bheò
triath na Hearadh ’s Chlàr Sgìth,
cha b’eagal da dìobhail stòir.

The usage is caomh leam (= is toigh leam) is typical of the Blind Harper’s native dialect of Lewis.

913. daor chùirt nan Gall: another reference to life at court in England (cf. l. 900 n) and the expense it entailed. See also l. 920.

915. Eilg: one of the early MacLeod chiefs had a charter of the lands of Glenelg from King David II (W. Robertson, Index of Charters, 48, 99, 100; The Book of Dunvegan I, 275).

Chlàr Sgìth: see l. 451 n.

918. a bhlàth air bhuil: literally, “its bloom on (the) outcome”. Cf. tha [a] bhlàth ’s a bhuil, MacL.

920. See l. 900 n.

922. a dhol ann an geall na chuir: the translation is rather tentative. The chief difficulty is how to interpret na chuir. With a dhol ann an geall compare théid mi ’n geall air, “I will be surety for him, become bound for him”. So the meaning appears to be, “(there) to become bound for all that they have staked (in gaming)”.

925. trusail: not in dictt. It may be connected with the verb trus, “gather”, and mean a gathering or collection of that

[TD 142]

part of the rents paid in kind (butter, cheese, hens, etc.), a task usually performed by the ground-officer (maor) which did nothing to add to his popularity. (Cf. l. 908 n.) If so, seachd trusail might mean a collection of such rents made in seven townlands.

925-926. At the end of the seventeenth century the price of a horse, as shown in the Dunvegan accounts, varies between 10s. and £3: 5s. sterling (The Book of Dunvegan I, 202).

927. làsdail: occurs in a collection of Lewis words and phrases (TGSI XXXVII, 17). Cf. làsdalachd, l. 281.

fo’n tòin: the article has been substituted for the possessive pronoun, which would refer to the horse, especially in view of ’na cheann in the next line.

927 ff. Twenty guineas is apparently quoted as the total cost of saddle and bridle, which must surely be considered an exaggeration if the currency is sterling, as it seems to be (see l. 946). The Dunvegan accounts show the price of a saddle and related accoutrements as varying between £1 19s. 10d. and £5 6s. 4¼d. (The Book of Dunvegan I, 204-205).

934. glac: can mean a hand at cards; but as làmh is used in that sense in the next line, it seems here to be the name of some specific card game, the nature of which is only guessed at in the translation “catch-the-ten”. The word béist, applied to the other player, might suggest that he is pictured as a sharper, or a professional gambler.

936. an leum: possibly the term for snatching a certain card when it showed.

938. h-aon-diag: apparently eleven dice, but the reference is obscure.

941 ff. Here again the prices quoted seem exaggerated when tested against contemporary evidence. At the end of the seventeenth century a gold hat-band could be purchased for 5s. 10d. and a hat at prices ranging from 12s. to £3 15s. sterling (The Book of Dunvegan I, 192). On the other hand the figure mentioned for the cravat seems to be on the low side. The prices in the Dunvegan accounts range from £1 8s. to £3 10s. sterling (ibid., 191).

949. luach mairt: mart was the word for a cow to be slaughtered at Martinmas (hence the name). According to contemporary documents, a mart was valued at £1 sterling (R. C. MacLeod, The Island Clans, 144-145). Cf. The Book of Dunvegan I, 155.

[TD 143]

950. In the Dunvegan accounts about this time a pair of the best silk stockings are quoted at £1 10s. sterling (The Book of Dunvegan I, 195).

952. ducatùn: DC provides the clue to this reading, which is surely a better interpretation of Duic o duin than Ducaid diuc in OGS, GB, MT. The ducatoon was an old silver coin in Venice and elsewhere, valued at from five to six shillings. It contained 32 grams of silver, and was regarded as the equivalent of one English crown. As to the price quoted, in the Dunvegan accounts we find a pair of “Shews waxed for the Leard” bought for 4s. sterling; but a pair of boots, also waxed, are entered as high as £1 15s. sterling (The Book of Dunvegan I, 205).

954. smàl: the vowel, normally short in Sc. Gael., was originally long, as here (: fearr, ard, barr). See RIA Contribb, s.v. smál, smól, smúal.

956. tastan: in view of the prices quoted below, apparently one shilling sterling, as now. The word was a borrowing from Sc. testan, testoon, originally a silver coin of the sixteenth century with Queen Mary’s head on it, the “inglis testane” being worth 8s. Scots (MacB). As to garters, and what they cost, in the Dunvegan accounts an ell of “taip for drawing the knees” costs 3d. and 6d. sterling on two different occasions, and a “taig” (tassel) 1s. 10d. sterling (The Book of Dunvegan I, 196).

’nam barr: the meaning is that the tassels attached to the ends of the garters, the part that showed when worn, were more expensive than the garters themselves, an observation that is confirmed by the prices quoted above.

958. bho’n Fhraing: then, as in more recent times, France was regarded as the arbiter of fashion, and with good reason, for the court of Louis XIV was the most splendid in Europe.

961. shadadh: the sources read thilgeadh, thilgeil, but the Harper must have said shadadh (: fasan).

964. peana: the sources have peann, but the necessity for an assonance with baile in the previous line indicates that the Harper’s form was peana, as in his native Lewis dialect now.

bann: the MacLeod chief’s propensity for giving his bond has been illustrated in the introductory notes on this song (p. 134).

967. ged chosd: see l. 168 n.

978. biùgail: the sources, with the exception of MT, read

[TD 144]

bucaill, which must be an error, as the necessary assonance with bhùth in the previous line is lacking. In MT the editor, seeing the difficulty, solves it characteristically by rewriting the whole line.

979. In Sc. Gael. the normal construction here would be ’s fheudar sin (a = do) fhaighinn dà; but the Lewis dialects are to some extent an exception, in that the construction in the text is to be heard, more especially in the districts of Back and Point. So here we may have an example of Roderick Morison following native Lewis usage. But, equally, he may be following literary usage. In Keating, for example, we find ní toil liom fastódh na bhfileadh, “I am not willing to retain the poets”, but not as yet ní toil liom na fileadha d’fhastódh. (For the syntax of both constructions, see Bergin, Stories from Keating’s History of Ireland, xv-xvi.)

984. mu spréidh: “in respect of cattle”. Cf. l. 566 n.

985. togar: perhaps we should read cunntar to provide assonance with ciùradh in the next line.

986. ciùradh: this reading is based on curadh in DC, which cannot stand for ciùrradh, “injure, hurt”, the reading in OGS. It must be a Gaelic borrowing of English “cure”, a word that was used with reference to the salting of beef. The arrangement envisaged may have been similar to that entered into in 1641 between James Barnes, burgess of Edinburgh, and George, Earl of Seaforth, whereby the latter dispones of 1,500 cattle to be delivered within the space of five years, the Earl undertaking to have them driven to the town of Stornoway and to furnish sufficient houses for the killing, keeping, salting and preserving of the beef (MS. History of North Uist by Dr. A. J. MacDonald in Edinburgh University Library). See also Martin, A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland, 69.

988. fiarach: see l. 405 n.

989. Uilleam Màrtainn: he was Iain Breac’s personal servant, and continued in the service of the next two chiefs, Roderick and Norman. In a discharge given by one Donald MacLeod, “indweller in the Isles”, there is mentioned the sum of 100 merks given to “Martin, MacLeoid’s man, for his charges north, dated March 9, 1694” (The Book of Dunvegan I, 252). There are two letters of his, dated October 1728, and 30th May 1730, written in defence of those responsible for the supervision of the MacLeod estate during the minority of Norman MacLeod, when the latter preferred certain charges

[TD 145]

against them (idem II, 4, 5). In later life he had the property of Inchfure in Easter Ross. His daughter Ann became the second wife of Norman MacLeod of MacLeod (1706–1772). See further I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 344 n, 345 n, 387 n; Clan MacLeod Magazine V, No. 30 (1965), 117; Mackinnon and Morrison, The MacLeods, 30 n. The Blind Harper evidently regarded Martin as an upstart, but one suspects that, as a competitor for the favour of Iain Breac, he may have been rather jealous of the other’s privileged position.

992. ris an àrmann: i.e., Iain Breac.

996. bùrach: with the exception of MT, the sources have ruamhar, which will not do, in view of the need for an assonance with diùc. Here again, in MT, the editor notices this, and rewrites the whole line. The obvious emendation is for ruamhar to substitute bùrach, which is a synonym, but somewhat insulting (it can mean rooting with the snout, like swine).

998. Ruaidhri òg: the young chief, Roderick, whose alleged lack of the chiefly virtues prompted the song.

1000. giodh: see l. 254 n.

1002. Iain: Iain Breac, Roderick’s father and predecessor as chief.

1007. theann: for lenition of initial consonants in a series of adjectives, with examples, see DB, xlvi. Cf. l. 192 n.

1010. This line refers to the fact that, unlike Roderick, Iain Breac had not been fond of town life, to the neglect of his estate.

1011. am bannach gun bhearn: this is a proverbial saying. Thus the widow of Donald MacAulay, tacksman of Brenish, Lewis, who died c. 1762, on hearing that he had left her all his possessions, which had been in dispute, exclaimed, Taing do shealbh gu bheil am bonnach slàn agam.—“Thank goodness that I have the whole bannock.” (From Mr Murdo MacAulay, Stornoway, a direct descendant of the aforesaid Donald MacAulay.) Compare the proverb, Is soilleir mìr a bonnach slàn.—“Bit from a whole cake is soon seen”. (NGP, 287.)

1012. aithriseadh: note that two constructions are used in the same sense. In l. 824 it is aithris air, but here the verb is followed by the accusative case. The common usage now is atharrais [ath + aithris] air.

[TD 146]

CUMHA DO FHEAR THALASGAIR

The title in E is “Oran a rinnidh do dh’Ian Mhac Shir Ruairidh fear thaillasgair; le Ruairidh Mac Mhuirich” (A Song made to John, son of Sir Roderick, Goodman of Talisker; by Roderick Morison); and in SO “Cumha do dh-Fhear Thalasgair” (A Lament for the Goodman of Talisker), with the note “Mr John M‘Leod, son of Sir Roderick M‘Leod”.

John MacLeod of Talisker appears to have had some share in the running of the MacLeod estate in the time of Iain Breac, perhaps as factor (I. F. Grant, The MacLeods, 330), and it seems likely that on the death of Iain Breac he assumed an even heavier burden of responsibility. It is clear, at any rate, that he continued to have an important role in estate administration. Thus, for example, on 23rd October 1699 the Presbytery of Skye are instructed to speak to him with a view to applying money for the repair of the church of Glenelg (Argyll Synod Register). He certainly played the part of patron to poets and musicians (see Introduction, pp. lxi ff.), thus doing something to fill the blank left by the fact that no one was holding court at Dunvegan. This lament is not our only indication that he befriended Roderick Morison (ibid.), and the severance of the latter’s ties with the MacLeod family and estate must have followed upon his death, which took place c. 1700 (I. F. Grant, loc. cit.). The Blind Harper perhaps surmised that he had now reached a parting of the ways, and it may not be fanciful to detect a note of foreboding (see especially l. 1021) underlying the conventional sentiments expected of him, expressing his grief on this occasion, as he does, in the metre and impersonal manner of the bards. (Cf. pp. 151, 163.)


1013. A Choinnich: who this was must remain matter of conjecture. But there is a possibility that it was Kenneth MacLeod, tacksman of Scallasaig, Glenelg (Donald Mackinnon, The MacLeods of Arnisdale, 12), a newcomer to that region, like the Harper himself, for whom it would be natural to seek out one of the few MacLeods among the neighbouring tacksmen with whom to share his grief.

cuiream: the source represents cuireamaid, now the normal form in Sc. Gael. But this gives three unstressed syllables between the two main stresses, which is one too many. The solution would appear to be that we should read cuiream, an

[TD 147]

alternative form of the 1 pl. imperative. (See SGS V, 162.) To the examples given in the place just cited may be added Nì n-léigeam ar tì air dearmad (BGh, l. 5933). Similarly, in BGh, l. 5935 (E, 25, XII b), we should probably read, not Tréigeamaid (E) or Tréigmid (BGh), but Tréigeam farmad is mìorun.

cuiream le: for this idiom, cf. Is mithich leibh cur leinn.—“It is high time for you to assist us.” (Am Bard, Leabhar I, 60.) Another example is:

<gai>Is cian ’s gur fhad’ tha thu ’d laighe,
nach do dh’éirich thu fathast
chur le deagh Mhac Gill’ Eathain<eng>
(JM, 199).—

More than long have you been reclining,
when you have not risen yet
to aid worthy Maclean.

1014. dèanam: the same remarks apply as on cuiream in the previous note.

1028. soillse: in view of internal assonance (: oidhche, lanntair, choinnlean, fhaighneachd), and also the fact that sòlas occurs in ll. 1035, 1044, this emendation of sòlas seems justified.

1030. lanntair: this is the form in Lewis; elsewhere lainndeir.

1033. an Eòin seo: John MacLeod of Talisker, the subject of the lament.

1035. chuir … an goinne: literally, “put into greater degree of scarcity”, though, for the notion of degree, one would expect goinnead as the more likely form, on the analogy, e.g., of a’ dol an daoiread, “getting dearer”. Cf.

<gai>Gun aithnichinn do bhuidheann
a’ tighinn o’n mhòintich
air ghilead an léintean
’s air dheirgead an cleòcan,
air ghuirmead an triubhais
’s air dhuibhead am brògan<eng>
(Traditional; cf. TGSI XV, 146).—

I would know your company
coming from the hill
by the whiteness of their shirts
and the redness of their cloaks,
by the blueness of their trews
and the blackness of their shoes.

[TD 148]

Cf. l. 652 n.

1036. an Eòin eile: John MacLeod (Iain Breac) of Dunvegan.

1048. ’n Clàr Sgìth: here, if the source is to be relied on, the article is used, despite the fact that Clàr is followed by another noun (Sgìth) in the genitive case. Similarly, an Cuan Sgìth is met with as well as Cuan Sgìth (The Minch). Butnote that the article is not used in ll. 451, 658, 915. See further l. 451 n.

an clàr rosgìth: not a very happy pun, nor is rosgìth a very happy compound form, as metre demands a close compound, with stress on ro-.

1060 ff. The reference is to the proverb, B’fhearr an t-olc a chlaistinn na an t-olc fhaicinn (It were better to hear of misfortune than to see misfortune) (Rel. Celt. II, 481).

1064. m’Iain: the subject of the lament, John MacLeod of Talisker.

1065. cinneasach: the source has coinseasach. The emendation is suggested by the need for assonance with snigh’, tighearnail, luighe (rather than laighe), and cridhe.

1068. nighean Alasdair: John MacLeod of Talisker’s wife, who was Janet, only child of Alexander MacLeod, younger of Greshornish. After his death she married, as his first wife, Sir James MacDonald of Sleat. (MacKenzie, History of the MacLeods, 231, 265; Clan Donald III, 474.)

TRANSLATION

Blow those bellows for me, boy, and bring over the hammer to the anvil, so that I may pluck unwonted strings for this man who is taking liberties with us. He said to the tinkers that they were given to drinking; that is no shame for craftsmen, that they should frequent so many taverns.

The king of that fraternity has now come before us; he has grown genial and companionable, and it is easy for him to be constantly drinking. He has got an anvil handy, well fashioned by MacLeod; no sooner are three blows struck on it by him than he earns a groat for it.

And though Catherine was self-assured, and Morison who trailed after her: to my mind, though he is readiest at fashioning something with his hammers—since I have been called Gillimichell, why should I lower my voice?—devil the groat have they earned but has been spent by them on drink.

[TD 178]

But what is this that the sly rascal is insinuating to me—a man who has always been drinking from wine-cups without fail since his youthful years? His passion was for that clanswoman ruined by his treatment of her, until at last he broke the band at the place underneath her.

Very good as a merry fellow is one of his wiles and ways, though he turned his back on his wedded wife, leaving her in broken health. Does he not now deserve to be whipped, if justices were within reach of him, as he persists in his whoring because the other’s music is more delectable.

But as he cannot see her well—her head, her wont and manner—he often takes her shift off her, jealous as he is of George’s son. When she turns outrageous on him, with the shrewishness of her tongue, he shows her his tuning-key, and presses his finger in her [ ? ].

Should I see King William and the clergy who swore fealty to him, I would send in a cleverly drafted report on his base conduct; but as they are down in London, much dejected by the news of the day, I shall send him to the sheriff to be examined under oath in court.

As to what the scathing fellow said to the heir of the MacLeods, who renounced the sword, offering no violence to the one who was saying it: should he see King James come with his sharp-edged blades over the sea, devil the prosperity would it bring to him, to stand him in good stead till the day of his death.

By his ill-natured abuse he has put to shame these newly appointed commanders who will not willingly go to Flanders to attack Frenchmen and get hurt; (the more so) in that he recommended to them the fine needle without an eye—if alarm or excursion should overtake them, that it could be stuck in their rear.

But I know in a certain place a brother of the craft, if he is alive, between here and the point of Gairloch, who is not ashamed of being given to drinking—if he should chance to be

[TD 179]

in that place, unless his fist should fail, he would ram it in the rear of some of them furiously with a hammer.

NOTES

There are thirty verses (240 lines) in F (LSMR, 262-275), of which only the first ten are given here, as the remainder make no further reference to the Blind Harper, and are mainly concerned with the political situation at the time. The drift of the remarks about the Harper may be rather difficult to follow at first sight, owing to the use of symbolism. As explained in the following notes, the anvil stands for the harp at the outset, but thereafter the harp becomes the “other woman”, for whom the Harper neglects his wife, and the symbolism takes on a sexual significance, conveyed in ambiguous language, similar to that of the Harper himself in Féill nan Crann.


1. See l. 241 n.

2. See l. 242 n.

5-6. Cf. ll. 249-250. A better reading (though not justified by the MS.) would be

gun duirt e ris na ceardan
gum bu ghnàth leo bhith ri òl.

This avoids the harsh elision of the vowel before the spirant in b’ ghnàth. Or read gur gnàth, as in l. 250?

7. sgannal: though Macrae writes scandile, this does not necessarily mean that he would not Gaelicise the word in speech.

9. rìgh nam braithrean: i.e., the supposed fraternity of tinkers. In reality, the phrase is an acknowledgment of Roderick Morison’s pre-eminence as a harper.

10. còir: a syncopated form of comhair here, following the prep. fo. Cp. l. 875 n.

13 ff. inneoin: ostensibly the anvil appropriate for the work of a ceard; but in actual fact the harp for the playing of which MacLeod is said to pay at the rate of a groat for three notes.

15. oirr’: MM has orr’, with the extraordinary explanation,

[TD 180]

“orra ought to be in the place of air in next line, and vice versa: metathesis” (LSMR, 322). It is true that, grammatically, the prepositional pronoun refers to the masc. noun inneoin, but, as already explained, in reality the reference is to the harp, and clàrsach is a fem. noun—hence oirr’.

16. buidhinn: buyn̄in in F, correctly transliterated in MM as buidhninn. But assonance demands buidhinn. So also in l. 23, where F reads veūnin, with the first n apparently deleted.

gròt: a courtly writer of Queen Elizabeth’s time (1589) makes reference to “blind Harpers and such like taverne Minstrels that give a Fit of mirth for a groat” (Percy, Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, 34).

17-18. These lines have been commented on already (Introduction, pp. lxx-lxxi).

19. giodh: see l. 254 n.

19-20. giodh e as ullamh: this is probably an acknowledgment, in terms of the “tinker” fiction, that the Blind Harper is a readier composer of songs than Macrae.

21. thubhradh: a preterite passive form, like Ir. adubhradh. Normally thubhairteadh, thuirteadh in Sc. Gael.

23. bhuidhinn: see l. 16 n, supra.

23-24. Here it is alleged, with what truth cannot now be said, that the Harper and his wife were addicted to the bottle.

27. As already mentioned (p. 104), the reference is to the fact that Duncan Macrae was known as Donnchadh nam Pìos (Duncan of the Drinking-cups), apparently because of the splendour of his table-ware.

29. a’ bhean-chinnidh: from what follows in the next two verses, it is clear that this is the harp, though why it is called a “clanswoman” does not appear. The idea of the Harper forsaking his wife for the harp is in line with the proverb, Darna bean a’ chlàrsair—a’ chlàrsach fhéin.—“The harper’s second wife—the harp itself.” (NGP, 162.) The same idea is conveyed by Eud bean a’ chruiteir.—“The harper’s wife’s jealousy.” (Ibid., 173.) It is also stated that Neil Gow’s fiddle was said to be his second wife, and that there is a tune so called (ibid., 162).

34. dùisligean: not in dictt. Taken to be a variant of dùisleannan (LSMR, 322). See Dw and MacB, s.v.; “ùisliginn, whims, properly dùisliginn” (NICS, 214).

38. f’a chòir: see l. 10 n, supra.

39. siùrsaidheachd: suirsich in F and siùrsachd in MM,

[TD 181]

but metre demands three syllables.

40. ise: the emphatic form of the pronoun, to indicate that the reference is, not to the bean-phùisde in l. 36, but back to the bean-chinnidh (i.e., the harp) previously mentioned in l. 29.

41. léir dha is’: the transliteration in MM makes no sense; leir rais in F. The reference is to the Harper’s blindness. Cf. ll. 17-18 n, supra; p. 106.

43. léine: for a léine. The symbolism here is suggested by the act of taking the cover off the harp before playing it.

44. ’s e ’g eudach ri mac Dheòrs: this appears to be an allusion to a song in praise of the violin composed by a contemporary poet, Alexander MacDonald, son and successor of Angus MacDonald of Ardnabie, who fought at Killiecrankie in the army of Viscount Dundee (Clan Donald III, 345). The song begins:

<gai>Gum b’ait leam bhith làimh riut,
a Mhàiri nighean Deòrsa,—<eng>

I’d delight to be near you,
Mary daughter of George.

So he addresses the violin. But later on he calls it an céile bh’aig Deòrs, “the spouse that George had”. (E, 269, 271.) Duncan Macrae’s version appears to have been an céile bh’aig mac Dheòrs, “the spouse that George’s son had”. The meaning is that Roderick Morison, as a harper, is jealous of the harp’s standing vis-à-vis the violin. (For the Blind Harper’s contempt for fiddling and fiddlers, see Instrumental Music, p. 164.) MacDonald of Ardnabie’s song is directed to be sung to the tune of another called Màiri inghean Deòrsa (E, 269). This may be the song, of which the text seems to be lost, by Grant of Sheugly in Glen Urquhart, comparing, as a performer on them all, the merits of harp, pipe and violin, the last under the name of Màiri nighean Deòrsa (Fraser of Knockie, Airs and Melodies, 2, 96). See also An Gàidheal IV (1875), 135; and BGh, l. 2991 n.

45. déistneachd: F reads eistnighk, hence the transliteration in MM, which, however, yields no sense. It seems, therefore, necessary to emend the reading in the MS., even though it is the composer’s autograph.

47. crann-gleusda: the double entendre here is the same as the Blind Harper’s in Féill nan Crann, with which Duncan Macrae was doubtless acquainted. The form gleusda is the

[TD 182]

genitive of the verbal noun gleusadh (cf. l. 692 n).

51. rumpalt: possibly from E. “rumble” in the sense of a rumour or report.

52. trùillebeart: the first element is apparently trùille, “filthiness”, which, though not in dictt., may be inferred from trùilleach, “a filthy person”.

56. mhionnachadh: the transliteration in MM will not do because of the need for assonance with siorraimh in the previous line.

57. A leth ’s gun: cf. Ir. i leith is go, “as if, even if, in view of the fact that” (Din).

57-58. The meaning and significance of these lines have been discussed already. See pp. 107 ff.

59. A reference to the fact that young MacLeod took no retaliatory measures against the Blind Harper, despite the latter’s bitter invective. Cf. Introduction, pp. lx, lxi; and p. 134.

66. na comanndairean: see pp. 105-106.

69. aonais: taken to be a variant of Ir. aghnas, “a plea” (LSMR, 322).

70. gun chrò: meaning that it could not be threaded, and so could not be pulled out again?

70 ff. Cf. ll. 277-280. What the exact function or symbolism of the needle is seems uncertain. The insinuation is that the officers are cowards. Was the needle to be stuck into them in order to speed their flight from the enemy? Probably Duncan Macrae did not, any more than the Blind Harper, want them to be faithful soldiers of King William.

74. bràthair ceairde: apparently some other poet in Wester Ross between Duncan Macrae’s residence in Inverinate in Kintail and some promontory in Gairloch (l. 75), perhaps Rubha Ré. Who he was we do not know. At the time the most notable men of the sort in Wester Ross were John Mackay (Am Pìobaire Dall), piper to the Laird of Gairloch, and Murdoch Matheson, bard to William, Earl of Seaforth. John Mackay was a friend of Roderick Morison (see Introduction, pp. lxiii ff.).

Now, if … if he … if the Blind Harper was his son, the account that MacKenzie has in The Beauties of Gaelic Poetry is not correct, for he says that he was the son of an Episcopalian minister who was in Stornoway.

The name is not now in local use, but there is a site still known as Tobhta a’ Chlàrsair, situated in Galder, near Glenelg school. It cannot have been much of a farm as regards extent. The reputed site is a small area between, on the east, the farm of Buorblach (some 300 acres), which since the mid-eighteenth century has been the glebe, and, on the west, the crofting township of Galder, which probably was a farm on its own at the end of the seventeenth century.

that after this the harper walked about for many years in Skye and the mainland. Upon his travels he met a person who told him that a son of his late chief was being educated in Edinburgh. He did not credit the story. Nevertheless he travelled all the way to Edinburgh on foot in the hope of seeing the boy. The story goes that the schoolmaster to test him brought half a dozen boys. The harper thereupon put his hand to their foreheads and asked them to speak individually. He declared with emphasis that there was not a MacLeod among them. We can imagine, says the narrator, if the story is true, his joy when the young MacLeod was at last brought forward. (1)—Nat. Lib. MS. 3782.

POSTCRIPT TO A LETTER OF THE REV. ANGUS MORISON
[Beurla]

[TD 206]

APPENDIX E

JOHN MORISON OF BRAGAR
(Cf. Introduction, pp. xl-xli; Appendix C, p. 192.)

The earliest account of John Morison of Bragar is to be found in the pages of Martin Martin, who describes him as “a person of unquestionable sincerity and reputation”. (1) Other accounts of him are traditional, including traditions current in Lewis down to the present time. More than any other Lewisman, he has left the impress of his personality on the minds of succeeding generations. He is specially remembered for his ready wit, expressed in impromptu verse. According to tradition, a contemporary, John MacKenzie of Assynt, to whom he gave hospitality at Bragar, (2) described him in the Earl of Seaforth’s presence as having “lady’s modesty, bishop’s gravity, lawyer’s eloquence and captain’s conduct” (3)—rather fulsome praise; but it may be accepted that he was a man of character and ability. There is the story of him as the diplomat, patching up a quarrel between his superior, the Earl of Seaforth, and MacLeod of Raasay; (4) and again, as the tactician, showing the same Earl of Seaforth how to bring the siege of Ardvreck Castle in Assynt to a successful issue. (5) There is a reference, apparently to him, in the song by his friend, Murdoch MacKenzie of Achilty, (6) from which we gather that he was noted for his skill, not only in poetry, but also in music:

<gai>Bhiodh ceòl fidhle ’nar cluais
o’n Eòin fhìnealt gun ghruaim,
fear on rìoghail cur dhuan air folbh.<eng> (7)—

There would be fiddle music in our ears
from John, handsome and jovial,
a man who throws off verses with royal prodigality.

John Morison was also a man of good education, though he seems not to have attended a university, as one or two contemporary Lewis tacksmen did. (8) At least one document written and subscribed by him has survived. (9) His books are entered

[TD 207]

as an item in an inventory of his effects made after his death. (10) We have evidence of his literary ability in his Description of the Lewis, (11) written between 1678 and 1688. (12) This work has been erroneously attributed to his son, the Rev. John Morison. (13) But he could not have been the author, for he did not graduate at Edinburgh University until 1692. (14) Furthermore, the Description bears to have been written “by John Morisone Indweller there” (i.e., in Lewis), (15) and the Rev. John Morison must have left Lewis as a youth and was not an “indweller” or resident in the island after reaching maturity. It is therefore virtually certain that the Description of the Lewis is the work of his father, John Morison of Bragar.

Judging by the dates when two of his sons completed their studies at the University of Edinburgh, (16) John Morison must have been born about 1630, and probably received his education in an institution praised by him in his Description of the Lewis—the school maintained by the Earls of Seaforth in Stornoway. (17) He was apparently in possession of other lands in Lewis before going to Bragar. According to tradition, he and his brother Donald were joint-tacksmen of Upper Coll (Col Uarach). John did not prosper there, and was looking for some means of improving his situation in life. He found his opportunity when he was one of a large number of tenantry assembled to welcome the Earl of Seaforth on one of his visits to Lewis. (18) At that time there was no pier on the Stornoway water-front, and it happened that the tide was at the ebb. John Morison, acting, according to some accounts, on a friend’s advice, waded out and carried the Earl ashore on his back. The noble lord, gratified by this service, asked if there was any way in which he could show him favour. John Morison said that he would like to have another tack than the one he had, and, in answer to a further question, admitted that it was the townland of South Bragar he had in mind.

The story-tellers have embellished this plain tale with some weird touches of their own. (19) John Morison’s failure to prosper in Upper Coll is attributed to the activities of certain malevolent females (bha a chuid air a mhilleadh le boireannaich); the implication is that the females concerned were practising witchcraft against him and injuring him in his means, as, for example, by putting spells on his cattle and taking away the “substance” (toradh) of their milk. In some versions of the story he is told by a spirit (fuath, tanasg) (20) that he must leave Coll and cross

[TD 208]

Abhainn a’ Ghlinn Duibh on the stroke of midnight (aig a’ mheadhon-oidhche), otherwise the same misfortune (tubaist) will follow him to Bragar. There is at least one account (21) which locates these happenings, not at Upper Coll, but at Swordale in Point; but, as it also mentions the crossing of Abhainn a’ Ghlinn Duibh, there must be some mistake; a glance at the map will show that the river in question is not on the way from Swordale to Bragar. It is possible, however, that John Morison lived at Swordale before going to Upper Coll, and, indeed, the claim that he lived at one time in Point (An Rubha) is made in more than one account. (22)

John Morison’s move to Bragar meant that he became the largest tacksman in Lewis. (23) In his encounter with the fuath he is supposed to have been told that he would settle in Bragar and that he would have a stook of barley for every day in the year on the bottom of Loch Ordais (gu suidhicheadh e a chabair am Bradhagair, agus gum biodh currcag eorna aige mu choinneamh a h-uile latha ’so’ bhliadhna air grunnd Loch Ordais). This loch was subject to inundation by sea water during high tides. John Morison made a channel between the loch and the sea into which he put a sluice with a valve that let the loch water out but did not let the sea water in. In this way he drained the loch and brought the land into cultivation. After his time, the drainage system was neglected and much of his work was undone. John Morison’s house in Bragar was situated at Cnoc Bhaile Loch, and he had a summer house at Cnoc Cràidh. His still was at Glaic an Airm, just below the site now known as Seann Tigh Chaluim Oig. His mill was to the east of the later Muilinn Iarach on the stream that flows from Loch an Dùine. It is said that he diverted this stream (Abhainn an Dùine) to drive the mill. Surrounded by such amenities, John Morison is traditionally represented as a man enjoying a life of prosperity and contentment, were it not for an ill-tempered wife and the impositions of the ground-officer (maor) and teind-collector (pracadair). (24) There is no doubt that he lived in comfortable circumstances according to the standards of the time, and story-tellers of a later day were probably not exaggerating unduly when they pictured him laying his head on the pillow on a calm night and listening to the trickle of the still on the one side and the clatter of the little mill on the other. (An uair a leigeadh e a cheann fodha air a’ chluasaig oidhche chiùin, chluinneadh e sreabhan na staile air an darna taobh agus glagan na muilne bige

[TD 209]

air an taobh eile.) (25) He died in 1708, (26) apparently at a good old age.

The following is a collection of verses traditionally ascribed to John Morison of Bragar. (27)


I

There are many traditions about John Morison’s wife, and none that speak well of her. There is reason to think that she may have been a daughter of Roderick MacKenzie and sister of Donald MacKenzie, tacksman of Dalbeg. (28) If so, it should be borne in mind that in the seventeenth century the MacKenzies must still have been regarded by Lewismen as aliens who had usurped the place of the native ruling family of MacLeod; and so the traditions in question may reflect the unpopularity, not only, or perhaps so much, of the lady herself, as of the clan to which she belonged. Some of the verses alleged to refer to her are not by John Morison at all. (29) In other cases there may be no reason for doubting the ascription to him, so far as known, and yet the theme of the unsatisfactory wife must have been so widespread that the traditional monopoly of such verses possessed in Lewis by one author must be regarded with some suspicion. (30)

In the verses now to be given John Morison bewails his wife’s performance of her household duties and the laziness of his servant-girl:

<gai>Fhuair mi bean chadalach òg—
’s e leòn mi a cadal ri h-aois;
’s e meud a cadal ri h-aois
a dh’fhàg mo chlàr gun taois.

Fhuair mi searbhanta dh’a réir
a reic air a cadal a gràs: (31)
cha sguab taigh, cha chuir sìos luath,
gun bhuabair (32) a bhith ri màs.—<eng>

I got a sleepy young wife—
what has pained me is her sleeping in later years;
it is all her sleeping in later years
that has left my baking-board without dough.

I got a servant-maid to match her,
who has sold her grace for sleep;
she neither sweeps the house nor removes ashes
unless a besom (?) is applied to her bottom.

[TD 210]

II

John Morison is also supposed to have complained that his wife’s tongue was never at rest:

<gai>Toiseach tùs an anraidh
an taigh am bi ’n toirm:
an coileach tric ’na thàmh
’s a’ chearc a ghnàth ag gairm.<eng> (33)—

The very beginning of trouble
in a house filled with noise:
the cock often silent,
and the hen for ever crowing.


III

To her other faults John Morison’s wife is accused of adding bad temper and greed. Once the family ran out of meal, and this led to an outburst of scolding that changed to smiles when she saw a well loaded horse coming from the mill. John Morison said:

<gai>Nì thu gàire ris a’ mhin,
’s misde do ghion (34) bhith gun bhiadh;
is b’fhearr leam fhìn na ’n t-each dearg
nach do ghabh thu fearg a riamh.—<eng>

You smile to see the meal;
your temper is the worse for lack of food;
and it would be more to me than the roan horse
if you had never given way to anger.


IV

The roan horse mentioned in the preceding verse was a special favourite of John Morison, and famous all over Lewis. One day the horse bolted and no one could catch him. John Morison supplied an appropriate comment spoken by the horse:

<gai>Thuirt an gearran dearg ris a’ chìobair,
“Seall a bheil mo chalpannan dìreach;
teichidh mi air falbh
a buaile chruidh gu dearbh—
’s treise mi na calmaich na sgìre.”—<eng>

[TD 211]

The roan gelding said to the shepherd,
“See if my shanks are straight;
I will run away
from the cattle-fold and no question—
I am stronger than the stalwarts of the parish.”


V
John Morison was concerned about the damage done to his crops by marauding sheep, and he determined to build a dyke to keep them out. As he himself said:

<gai>Théid an gàrradh air a bhonn,
théid e gu teann fo cheap glas;
a’ chaora, ma bhios i thall,
cha tig i nall ge bhris a cas.—<eng>

The dyke will be set on its base,
it will be firmly built under its cope of green sods;
the sheep, if it is on the far side,
will not get over though its leg should break.


VI

On one occasion John Morison was out walking by the sea-shore, and found the Bragar tenants busily catching fish in a weir (caraidh). When he saw that none of his own servants was taking part in the work, he threw off his coat and said, as if addressing the coat:

<gai>Ma sheallas sinn ris an uaisle,
bidh sinn ’san uair seo falamh;
ach o nach fheairrde sinn an fhalmhachd,
bidh thus’ an dràsd air failbhean (35) na caraidh.—<eng>

If we consider gentility,
we will for the present be empty-handed;
but as empty-handedness will do us no good,
you will lie for the nonce on the copestone of the weir.

John Morison was summoned to Stornoway to act as a juror when he was busy shearing. In this dilemma he said:

<gai>Ma théid mi ann, théid mi as,
’s ma dh’fhuireas mi as, théid mi ann.—<eng>

[TD 212]

If I go there, I shall suffer in my means,
and if I stay away, I shall gain by it. (36)


VIII

John Morison did not like going to Stornoway. He entertained a poor opinion of the townsmen and their grasping mercenary ways:

<gai>Cha téid mis’ a Steornabhagh,
chan ’eil mo chomhnaidh ann,
far a bheil na buirdeasaich
a chuir an cliù ’nam broinn;
cha b’ionann mac an tuathanaich
bho’m faighinn faighdhe (37) shìl,
is bheirinn dha a rithis e
’n uair bhiodh e air a dhìth.—<eng>

I will not go to Stornoway,
my dwelling is not there,
where the burghers are
who have put their good name in their belly.
Not so the farmer’s son
from whom I would get a thigging of seed;
and I would give it back to him
if he had need of it.


IX

John Morison once sent a servant-lad to Stornoway to make some purchases which he listed for him in verse:

<gai>Dà mhaide dhìreach (38) gu caman,
dà mhaide chama (39) gu carn,
cliath, cas-dhìreach is bacan—
cuimhnich, a mhacain, nach fhàg.—<eng>

Two straight sticks for shinty clubs,
two bent sticks for a sledge,
a harrow, a straight delving-spade and a tether-stake—
take care, my boy, not to leave them behind.


X

“On one occasion John Morrison considered himself overcharged by the factor, and refused to pay his demand. The

[TD 213]

factor complained to Seaforth, who sent for Morrison to come to Stornoway. Morrison set out at once, putting the rent into one purse and what he considered to be the overcharge in another. When he arrived at Seaforth Lodge a large dog barked furiously at him, on which Morrison struck it a violent blow on the nose with his stick. The dog yelled dismally, and one of Seaforth’s servants, on coming to see what was the matter, commenced to abuse Mr Morrison, who punished his insolence by striking him on the jaw. The uproar now was greater than ever, and Seaforth made his appearance. John Morrison explained the origin of the row, and added:

<gai>Gille tighearn is cù mór,
dithis nach còir leigeadh leò;
buail am balach air a’ charbad,
’s buail am balgair’ air an t-sròin.”—<eng>

A laird’s servant-lad and a large dog,
two who should not be allowed to presume;
strike the fellow on the jaw,
and strike the cur on the nose.

“Seaforth was amused at Morrison’s impromptu verse, and welcomed him cordially. Morrison told him why he had not paid the rent, and presented the bag containing the real rent and what he had been overcharged. On inquiry, it was found that the factor exacted more than was just, and he was dismissed, while John Morrison had the honour of paying his rent in future into Seaforth’s own hands.” (40)

Among the dues, additional to rent, paid by the Lewis tenantry were the vicarage teinds. To save the factor the trouble of collecting them, they were farmed, that is, the factor sold the right of collection to a speculator at a figure that would allow him to make a profit on the transaction if he managed to collect all that was due. Inevitably, this man (am pracadair) was not very popular among the people, and John Morison shared their aversion. Once, when the collection of the teinds was taken away from one man and given to another, he made this comment:

<gai>Chuireadh Dubhghall bho na phraca,
mar nach glacadh e i riamh;

[TD 214]

’s mas e Mac Amhlaidh (41) as cearta,
chì gach neach sin le ghnìomh.—<eng>

Dugald has been deprived of the teinds,
as if he had never acquired them;
and if MacAulay is the juster man,
everyone will see that by his conduct.


XII

It appears that in John Morison’s time the local ground-officer (maor) claimed half of the dues paid to a smith. John Morison’s son Murdo was a smith, and he resisted this imposition. The ground-officer was Donald MacKenzie (Domhnall mac Ruaidhri), tacksman of Dalbeg. (42) John Morison supported his son, pleading his case thus:

<gai>Aon de charaibh an t-saoghail,
saoilidh mi gu bheil e tuathal:
gobha ’ga losgadh an ceardaich,
’s leth na càin (43) aig Domh’ll mac Ruaidhri.—<eng>

One of the oddities of life,
to my mind it is against reason:
a smith getting scorched at the forge,
and half the dues going to Donald son of Roderick.


XIII

In the following lines, ascribed in Lewis to John Morison, dissatisfaction is expressed with the way in which the ground-officer does business:

<gai>Mo chomain ’s comain a’ mhaoir,
do mo thaobh-sa bhiodh i gann:
bu mhath leis comain a null,
ach gun chomain null ’s a nall.<eng> (44)—

A favour from me and a favour from the ground-officer,
there would be but a grudging one for my share:
he would like a favour to come his way,
but not that favours should go both ways (be reciprocal).

In John Morison’s day heather rope (sìoman fraoich) was used to hold down the thatch on houses and steadings. The heather

[TD 215]

had to be of fine texture, and collected in the summer season. On one occasion two of John Morison’s servants were sent to pull heather for making ropes. One of them did not shake the heather he pulled and left lumps of earth sticking to the roots. The other pulled everything indiscriminately, including coarse stems, not fit for the purpose intended. When they returned home, each with his load, John Morison said:

<gai>Chuir mi Breunan is Fudaidh
bhuain fraoich an cuideachd a chéile:
thug Breunan dhachaigh an cudthrom,
’s thug Fudaidh dhachaigh na geugan.—<eng>

I sent Nasty and Clumsy
to pull heather together:
Nasty brought home the weight,
and Clumsy brought home the stems.


XV

The sub-tenants of a tacksman were required to work for him on a stated number of days. Once, when the people of Baleloch, in Bragar, were working for John Morison, they had breakfast in his house, and lingered rather long over the meal. In his impatience to resume work, John Morison said:

<gai>Fasan muinntir Bhaile Loch,
an deaghaidh mo chuid brochain òl:
h-uile fear a’ bagairt éirigh,
’s cha togadh e fhéin a thòin.<eng> (45)—

The habit of the Baleloch people,
after supping my gruel:
each man making to rise,
and yet not lifting his bottom.

According to Martin Martin, “Donald-Chuan, in a village near Bragir, in the parish of Barvas, had by accident cut his toe at the change of the moon, and it bleeds a fresh drop at every change of the moon ever since”. (46) The memory of him has been perpetuated in Lewis, not on this account, but because he was the subject of one of John Morison’s impromptu verses.

[TD 216]

He was apparently a poor landless man. (47) One tradition has it that “Domhnall a’ Chuain was an old bachelor who had nothing to do but to go rock and loch fishing, and when lucky to get some fish and gorge himself, he would go and lie on the hillside”. (48) Finding him in this position, John Morison addressed him to the following effect:

<gai>Is buidhe dhuit fhéin, Dhomh’ill a’ Chuain,
’s tu ’nad laigh’ air do chluain thaobh:
cha tog pracadair do gheall,
ni mò tha thu ’n taing nam maor.<eng> (49)—

You are a lucky man, Donald of the Ocean,
lying at ease on your side:
no teind-collector will exact what you owe,
nor are you beholden to ground-officers.


XVII

John Morison had a neighbour—according to some accounts, he was known as An Croiteir Ruadh (50)—with whom he was not on very good terms. In an attempt to compose their differences, it was arranged that they should meet over the flowing bowl, but the quarrel only flared up anew, and the neighbour abruptly took his departure without accepting any hospitality. (It is said that, as a result of the quarrel, he eventually migrated to the parish of Lochs.) In this situation John Morison said:

<gai>Dh’fhalbh thu ’s cha mhisde leam,
’s dh’fhàg thu mo leann agam fhéin,
’s leis a’ bhith a tha ’nam fheòil
dhèanainn òl ged dheigheadh tu eug. (51)

Ach bidh mi réidh ’s am fear ruadh,
’s bidh am fear ruadh réidh is mis’;
’s bidh searrag againn an cùil,
ma bhios i eadar Uig is Nis.<eng> (52)—

You have gone, and a good riddance,
and you have left my ale to myself;
and so incensed to the core am I
that I would drink it though you should die.

[TD 217]

But I will be quit of the red-headed man,
and the red-headed man quit of me;
and we* will share a bottle on the quiet,
if one can be got between Uig and Ness.

* i.e., John Morison and his cronies.


XVIII

Once John Morison was asked for his opinion of two of his clansmen (53) in Lewis. This was his reply:

<gai>Nan tachradh iad rium air sgeir,
cha tugainn dheth Iain mac Uilleim
’s dh’fhàgainn Iain mac Ailein air.<eng> (54)—

If I found them marooned on a rock,
I would not take John son of William off,
and I would leave John son of Allan on.


XIX

It is said that John Morison’s well-timed intervention once prevented bloodshed between the MacKenzies and the MacLeods. Having established themselves in Lewis, the MacKenzies, for obvious reasons, made a point of claiming that the old ruling family of MacLeod had left no legitimate succession. The MacLeods, on the other hand, had no doubt as to the line of descent in which the chiefship of the clan lay, and continued to accord to the representative of that line (55) all the appropriate honours. When he died, they made preparations to bury him in the tomb of the MacLeod chiefs at Aignish. (56) On the day of the funeral the MacKenzies made a hostile demonstration, and threatened to disinter the dead man on the ground that he had no right to such a mark of recognition. At this point John Morison took action. He confronted the MacKenzies with a drawn sword in his hand, and said:

<gai>Leódhus gu léir aig Mac Coinnich,
ach leud a dhrom’ aig Mac Leòid. (57)—

Let MacKenzie have all of Lewis,
but let MacLeod have the breadth of his back.

The MacKenzies recognised that the bargain offered was to their advantage, involving as it did formal recognition by the

[TD 218]

MacLeods of the Earl of Seaforth as superior, and saw fit to withdraw.


XX

The leading MacLeod in Lewis in John Morison’s later years was John MacLeod (Iain mac Thorcaill), tacksman of Haclet, Bernera. At one time he was rather discontented at Haclet, and thought that he might better himself by moving elsewhere. But, when the opportunity for such a transfer occurred, he was in doubt whether to take advantage of it, and sent to John Morison for advice. He got the latter’s answer in verse:

<gai>Cha toigh leis an t-seangan an t-socair—
mar sin tha Mac Thorcaill ’s an imrich:
chan e dìth arain no brochain,
ach toiseach aig’ air a dhol iomrall.<eng> (58)—

The ant is not fond of ease—
so it is with Torquil’s son’s itch to move:
the cause is not want of bread or gruel,
but that he begins to fail in his judgment.

John MacLeod must have taken the advice to heart, for he remained in Haclet to the end of his days.

It would appear that John Morison was regarded in his day as the representative of his ancestors, the judges or lawmen of Ness, and that, on occasion, he was invited to act in a similar capacity to settle local disputes. There was once a controversy between the tenants of Upper and Lower Coll (Col Uarach agus Col Iarach) about the boundary between their common grazings, and John Morison was chosen as arbiter. After taking evidence from both sides and surveying the terrain, he pronounced judgment in these words:

<gai>Tha chìoch (59) am Bogha nan Naosg, (60)
’s mar thairrneas tu an taod teann (61)
dh’an Bhota Dhomhain (62) seo shuas,
’s a sin a Chol Uarach nam Beann.—<eng>

[TD 219]

The hub is in Bogha nan Naosg,
and as you draw the cable tight
to the Bota Domhain up here,
and from there to the hills of Upper Coll. (63)


XXII

It is said that this is what John Morison considered ideal weather between Christmas and the end of summer:

<gai>Cabhadh mór eadar dhà Nollaig, (64)
’s Màrt tioram a thodhar chrann;
tuil bhuirn an am na Bealltainn,
’s tart an deireadh an t-samhraidh ann.<eng> (65)—

A great snowstorm between the two Yules,
and a dry March to bleach the trees;
a deluge of rain about Mayday,
and a drought at the end of summer.


XXIII

The subject of the following verses seems to have been a priest whose conduct was unbecoming in one of his profession. It might be considered unlikely that John Morison would have any contacts with the priesthood in Protestant Lewis. We know of only two priests who visited the island in his day, and it is probable that there were few, if any, others. It so happens that one of these men was involved in a scandal that caused a considerable stir at the time, with repercussions in the courts of the Church and the Privy Council. One must suppose that the odds against a priest falling from grace in this way are considerable, while the odds against a priest doing so in a normally priestless island must be very long indeed. It is therefore possible to identify the one whose conduct was censured by John Morison with some confidence.

There was only one Roman Catholic family in Lewis towards the end of the seventeenth century—that of George MacKenzie of Kildun. (66) He matriculated at King’s College, Aberdeen, in 1655 and at Edinburgh University in 1656, (67) but apparently did not take his degree. This may have been because he lost his sight, (68) probably as a result of smallpox. He was ordained an elder of the Church of Scotland on 8th February 1674, at

[TD 220]

Dingwall, (69) but some years later he was received into the Roman Catholic Church. Although styled of Kildun (near Dingwall), he made his home during the latter part of his life at Aignish in Lewis, and was tacksman of extensive lands in the district of Point (An Rubha), granted to him by his brother, Kenneth, third Earl of Seaforth, who died in 1678. (70) In or about 1688 he gave hospitality to two priests at Aignish. Their names were Patrick O’Carolan and Cornelius Con, (71) the latter described as a doctor of the Sorbonne. (72) O’Carolan’s stay appears to have been of short duration, but Con remained at Aignish, probably acting as domestic chaplain to Kildun. No doubt he is the priest mentioned by Martin Martin to whom some Lewis fishermen—“about 14 years ago”—applied for holy water to sprinkle on their nets, at the same time turning their coats inside out as a sign of their conversion—all in the hope that they could thus ensure large catches of fish. As it happened, they lost their nets, and the priest lost credit accordingly. (73)

Con was soon to discredit himself more seriously. According to a traditional account, he “became so very familiar in the Laird’s [i.e., Kildun’s] family as to throw off the Sacerdotal restraint by getting one of the Laird’s daughters with child”. (74) Tradition finds confirmation in the following postscript to a contemporary letter written by one of John Morison’s sons, the Rev. Angus Morison, Contin: “Kildins daughter Jean is wt childe & as the report goes she has declair’d to some friends, priest Coan is the man ha ha”. (75) Con was banished, first to Fladda in Loch Roag, and subsequently to North Rona. According to the records of the Synod of Argyll (whose information about his character seems to have been rather inadequate), he was in Fladda in 1694 and in North Rona in 1696. (76) The affair came to the ears of the Privy Council, who sent an officer (a Lieutenant Walkingshaw) to investigate. He landed on Fladda, but all he found was a message from Con, by then partly illegible, written on the shoulder-blade of a sheep. This showed that Con’s guard, one of the Maclennans (sons of Iain mac Ruaidhri Chléirich) who were tacksmen of Little Bernera, (77) had got there first and removed him from the island. (78) He was finally liberated and wrote a letter of thanks to the Synod of Argyll in 1699. (79)

It is not at all unlikely that such a fama clamosa would evoke one of John Morison’s characteristic comments in verse.

[TD 221]

<gai>Is deacair do fhear aimcheist fhaoisid
ri sagart nach d’fhaod bhith air leth,
mun bhuin cliar gun fhiamh roimh ’n athais
nach d’fhaod cliath (80) a sgathadh dheth.

Ge maol do cheann, ’s fhada t’earball,
da tharraing a steach throimh bheul tuill;
nach cuirear a mach gun athais
am feadh bhios deur ri fhaighinn duinn.

Dà phìobair is dà mhadadh,
dà mhaor-eaglais is dà bhard:
an dream ud tha ’m feum an teagasg,<eng>		[sud, MS
<gai>’s anntlachd air pears’-eaglais àd.—<eng>

It is hard for an anxious man to make his confession
to a priest who has failed to remain a man apart,
a case touched on by poets without fear, ere the charge was made
of which a jury could not acquit him.

Though your head is tonsured, your tail is long,
drawing it in through an orifice;
(you) cannot be put outside without affronting you
as long as there is a drop of drink for us to get.

Two pipers and two hounds,
two church-officers and two bards:
those are people in need of instruction—
to a cleric they are a reproach.

As noted elsewhere, (81) Lewis tradition has it that the Blind Harper was John Morison’s eldest son, and a verse ascribed to his father is often quoted in proof. On one occasion he returned home on a visit after a long absence, and his mother failed to recognise him. John Morison’s comment was:

<gai>Cha tig fuachd gun tig Earrach,
cruadal no cruaidh chrannadh;
’s barail leam gur h-ann air éiginn
dh’aithnicheas bean a ceud leanabh.<eng> (82)—

[TD 222]

Cold does not come till Spring comes,
nor hardship, nor snell winds;
it seems to me that only with an effort
can a woman recognise her first child.


ADDENDA

John Morison had an only daughter Mary, (83) who seems to have shared her father’s penchant for ex tempore verse. It is said that she had two suitors, one of whom was a doctor. (84) The other suitor went to consult the doctor when suffering from sore eyes, and was given a preparation to use dissolved in warm water. Mary Morison, who was showing a preference for this man, suspected that the treatment prescribed by the doctor was not meant to do his rival’s eyes any good, but quite the reverse, and suggested that he had been better off bathing his eyes in cold water:

<gai>Bu bhrèagha leómhanta do shùilean
an uair bha iad ’sa’ bhurn fhuar;
ach ’n uair bha iad ’sa’ bhurn bhlàth
gholl (85) iad.—<eng>

Your eyes were winsome and bold
when bathed in cold water;
but when bathed in warm water
they grew bleary.


On one occasion John Morison was arbiter in a case in which two men claimed a foal. His decision was that the foal should be awarded to the man whose mare it followed. One of the men had, not a mare, but a gelding. The foal went to the gelding, and the award was made accordingly. The rightful owner, aggrieved at this decision, complained to John Morison’s daughter. She told him to go to a certain stream when her father was passing that way and dip a bag of salt in the water. She also told him what to say. John Morison duly arrived on the scene and asked the man what he was doing. “Making malt” (A’ dèanamh bracha) was the answer. “That is foolish

[TD 223]

work, with a bag of salt” (Is amaideach an obair sin, le poca salainn). To which the man replied:

<gai>Chan ’eil e nas amaidiche na—
an searrach bu chòir bhith as an làraidh
’ga shìor fhàsgadh as a’ ghearran.<eng> (86)—

It is no more foolish than—
the foal that should be out of the mare,
stubbornly squeezing it out of the gelding.

The man had the foal restored to him.


One of John Morison’s clerical sons, the Rev. Angus Morison, (87) Contin, also had a gift for ex tempore verse, some of it hardly befitting the dignity of the cloth. His best known effort of the kind is Dàibhidh greabhsgach crom ciar, a series of verses in which a weaver is bullied into leaving his own work in order to reap the minister’s corn. This piece was first published in Gillies’ Collection (pp. 138-139) and in fuller form in MacKenzie’s Aos-dàna (pp. 87-92). (88) The following are further specimens of these rather tasteless effusions.


A couple came to the Rev. Angus Morison to be married. (89) The young man told him that he had been to a fair a short time before and bought a churn and a quarter-pound of tobacco. The tobacco was stolen from his pocket. After the wedding ceremony had been completed Master Angus (Maighstir Aonghus) said:

<gai>Ghoideadh an cairteal tombac’ as do phòcaid
chuireadh an raipeas air do bhorr bhuidhe;
is mur biodh e air do ghualainn
is e bheirte bhuait am muidhe.—<eng>

From your pocket was stolen the quarter-pound of tobacco
that would leave a dirty stain on your yellow gob;
and if it had not been on your shoulder
it’s the churn that would have been taken from you.

[TD 224]

When the bridegroom heard that he said, “I will give you sixpence if you will praise me”. “Hand it over” (Fair a bhos i), quoth Master Angus; and he said:

<gai>Fhuair mi sèa sgillinn
air son an fhir ud a mholadh,
’s cha rachainn thairis air cuspair
ged theirinn busaidh ri borraidh—
busaidh breunaidh borraidh;
’s e busaidh fhéin
a b’fhearr a fhreagradh ort.<eng> (90)—

I got sixpence
to praise that man,
and I should not go beyond the mark
if I said “smouty” to “gobby”—
“smouty”, filthy, “gobby”;
it’s “smouty” in fact
that would suit you best.


At another wedding the Rev. Angus Morison is supposed to have said of the bride to the bridegroom:

<gai>Ge salach i ’s ge rapach i,
’s ge dubh lachdann riabhach i,
’s e do chuid-s’ an dràsd i.—<eng>

Dirty and untidy as she is,
and black, sallow and grizzled as she is,
she is yours now.

To which the bridegroom replied, “If that’s how she is, I've had enough of her” (Mas e sin mar a tha i, tha gu leòr agam dhith), and refused to continue with the ceremony. (91)


The Rev. Angus Morison’s brother John, during the latter part of his life, was minister of the parish of Urray, including Strath Conon. (92) Partly, no doubt, because the elder brother had been ordained a minister before, and the younger brother after, the Revolution of 1688, they disagreed on questions of ecclesiastical polity and perhaps also (in view of what follows) forms of worship. When visiting his brother, then apparently living in Strath Conon, the Rev. Angus took umbrage at not being invited to preach, conduct family worship, or even say grace before meals, and expressed his displeasure in verse:

[TD 225]

<gai>O mo mhinisteir
sunndach meanmnach,
’m ministeir glagach
as fhaide nì searmon,
’s oil leam an text
a bhith stad ann ad shealbhan,
O mo mhinisteir
sunndach meanmnach.

Bha mi oidhch’ an Srath Chonain
’n tigh a’ mhinisteir chorraich,
’s cha d’fhuair mi ann onair,
ard sgoileir sgìr Farbraoin.

Tràth thàinig am biadh
rinn e altachadh fiadhaich,
e cho fad ri slat-iasgaich,
’na dhriamlaich ’s ’na dhreamlainn.
. . . . . .
. . . . . . (93)
bha ’n urnuigh cho fada—
rug a’ mhadainn air cearb dhith.<eng> (94)—

O my minister,
lively and spirited,
the babbling minister
who makes sermon last longest,
I’m vexed that the text
should be left in your keeping,
O my minister,
lively and spirited.

One night I was in Strath Conon
in the crabbed minister’s house,
and there got no honour—
I, the best scholar in the parish of Fairburn.

When food was served
he said an uncouth grace,
as long as a fishing-rod,
all fankled and snarled.
. . . . . .
. . . . . .
the prayer was so long—
morning overtook a swatch of it.

[TD 226]

When the Rev. Angus Morison was on his death-bed, his wife and one of the elders were at his side. His wife was continually rocking herself and sighing, and saying ceaselessly, “Alas, woe is me today” (Ochadan mar tha mi ’n diu). At last Master Angus said as he lay in bed:

<gai>Ochadan mar tha thu ’n diu,
’s Aonghus Dubh a’ dol gu bàs;
cha dèan e pòsadh no baisteadh,
is chan fhaigh thu dad bho chàch.—<eng>

Alas, woe to you to-day,
with Black Angus about to die;
neither baptism nor marriage will he solemnise,
and you will receive nothing from others.

Then the elder spoke and said, “Master Angus, Master Angus, is it not time for you to give up that sort of thing, when it is more than likely that you are to part from the world in a very short time?”. The man who was in bed answered him at once:

<gai>Dealaichidh sinn ris an t-saoghal,
is dealaichidh an saoghal ruinn;
’s ged bheir thu ’n t-aodach dhe’n gharman,
leanaidh armadh ris an t-slinn.<eng> (95)—

We will part from the world,
and the world will part from us;
and though you take the cloth off the beam,
the dressing-oil will stick to the sley. (96)

[TD 228]

(29) There are at least three such verses:

(1)
<gai>Diùghaidh connaidh fearna fhliuch
diùghaidh sìde flion-chur;
’s gus an téid an saoghal as
’s e diùghaidh ’n t-saoghail droch bhean.—<eng>

Worst of fuel is wet alder,
worst of weather is a hail of sleet;
and until the world’s end
worst in the world is a bad wife.

This has been ascribed to John Morison (PSAS XII, 529; DT, 32). Elsewhere it appears without ascription (Nat. Lib. MS. LXV, p. 16; Mackinnon, Catalogue, 213; NGP, 227). What makes the ascription to John Morison most unlikely is that the verse also occurs in Irish sources. See O’Rahilly, Dánfhocail, No. 245.

(2)
<gai>Mar fhadadh teine fo loch,
mar thiormachadh cloich’ an cuan,
comhairle thoirt air mnaoi bhuirb
mar bhuill’ uird air iarann fuar.—<eng>

Like kindling a fire in a loch,
like drying a stone in the sea,
is the giving of counsel to a shrewish wife,
or like the blow of a hammer on cold iron.

Ascribed to John Morison in some sources (PSAS, loc. cit.; DT, loc. cit.). But in other sources there is no ascription (CC, 232; NGP, 60). In the MacColl MSS. (Highland Monthly II, 430) the verse occurs in a poem ascribed to Fear Fheurlochain, i.e., the Goodman of Feurlochan in Benderloch. But, in fact, the verse was just as well known in Ireland (O’Rahilly, op. cit., No. 89; and see also NGP, loc. cit.).

(3)
<gai>Och, a Rìgh!
mar a tha mi fhìn ’s mo bhean:
ma their mi gur dubh am fitheach,
their ise gu bheil e geal.—<eng>

Oh Lord!
My wife and I are in sorry plight:
if I say that the raven is black,
she will say that it is white.

Ascribed by the writer’s mother and others in Lewis to John Morison. But, here again, we find that a similar verse is known from Irish sources (O’Rahilly, op. cit., No. 77). Cf. UB, 229.

(30) As an example of a verse on this subject not recorded in Lewis we have the following from North Uist tradition:

<gai>Tha ’n uaisle ’na h-eire ro throm
air an fhonn far nach faighear an nì;
mo chreach, far nach faighear an crodh
chan fhaighear am modh leis a’ mhnaoi.—<eng>

on the land where kine are not found;
my sorrow, where cattle are not found

(Cf. NGP, 393.)

III

Sources: PSAS XII, 531; NGP, 334; DT, 32; and still widely current in Lewis. The version here given was learnt by the writer from his mother, who stated that a song was composed in praise of John Morison, but without a word about his wife, because of her unpopularity. She was furious, and, to appease her, John persuaded the author to add some verses of the sort she desired.

(34) gion: as io is often substituted for ea in Lewis (e.g., cionalta for ceanalta), this may be regarded as a variant of gean; on the other hand it may be gion, voracity, greed.

(37) faighdhe: see Watson, Scottish Verse from the Book of the Dean of Lismore, 272-275. Possibly a survival of ritual gift-giving, the suggestion in the verse that it was intended to be reciprocal is borne out by the writer (? Kenneth, fourth Earl of Seaforth, at the time of his coming of age) of an undated document (but c. 1680) who refers to “my thigging gotten as a gratuity of gentile men but oblidged to repay them ye same at their call” (DP, Book 1105, fol. 324 r). That it was by no means confined to the poor is indicated by a tradition that, when MacLeod of Lewis married, one of the first things his wife did was to go round the island thigging, with a young lad to assist her with the gifts she received (W. C. MacKenzie, The Western Isles, 132).

Duncan Lothian has similar lines to the above in his Seanfhocail agus Comhadan (NGP, 403; BGh, ll. 993-1000).

(44) The verse is ascribed to John Morison only in WW, NGP and DT. Otherwise it appears, in non-Lewis sources, without ascription. But these latter sources also have the inferior reading comunn for comain. The fact that the verse was better understood in Lewis might be regarded as a point in favour of a Lewis provenance.

(53) They cannot be identified with any confidence. According to tradition in South Dell, one of the former tacksmen was a Morison called Iain mac Ailein, probably John Morison, who is on record as tacksman of South Dell at various dates from 1704 onwards. (Information from the late Malcolm MacKenzie, South Dell, descended from a family of MacKenzies who succeeded the Morisons as tacksmen there; Commissariot of the Isles: Testament of John MacKenzie of Assynt; FEP.)

(54) If this witticism was John Morison’s, it cannot be regarded as altogether original. Aonghus nan Aoir said of Maclean of Ardgour and Maclean of Kingerloch:

[TD 233]

<gai>Mac mhic Eóghain ’s Mac mhic Eachainn

Variant:
<gai>Leódhus uile do Mhac Coinnich,

(Alexander Campbell)

(55) It is not known what this line was: perhaps that of Torquil Dubh, a son of the sixteenth century chief, Roderick MacLeod of Lewis. This Torquil Dubh had three sons, Roderick, Torquil and William, whose succession, if any, has not been traced. William appears to be the “Gulielmus McCloyd” who graduated at Glasgow University in 1622, and, as “Mr William McCloid”, witnesses a bond of caution as nephew of Sir Roderick MacLeod of Dunvegan on 10th December 1623, the designation “Mr” indicating that he was a Master of Arts (Munimenta Alme Univ. Glasg. III, 15; RPC XIII, 824). Sir Robert Gordon, who does not mention William, appears to be in error in stating that it was the eldest son, Roderick, who was a student at Glasgow University (Earldom of Sutherland, 276). There is no trace of him in the records.

(56) There is a saying in Lewis to the effect that twenty-one (in some versions nineteen) MacLeod chiefs lie under the one tombstone in the churchyard of Eye. (Tha tighearna ar fhichead de Chlann Mhic Leòid fo’n aon lic an cladh na h-Aoidhe.) They are, in fact, buried within the church. The figure quoted (whether nineteen or twenty-one) can be regarded as plausible only by supposing that it includes the individual whose rights were defended by John Morison, and a good number of his successors.

(57) John Morison was well qualified to make such an appeal to the MacKenzies, for the Morisons had played a considerable part in ensuring that Lewis should pass into their hands. The other side to the bargain he proposed apparently was that, not only should the dead man be allowed to rest in peace, but that later representatives of the family should have the same right; and the identity of families who made a point of exercising this right until recent times is still known in Lewis.

Sources: WW; AML; DT, 53 (see note 52 supra); the version in the text is from the writer’s mother and aunt. As the other versions differ considerably they are given here:

(1)
<gai>Cha b’e dìth arain no dìth brochain

(3)
In another version instead of Mac Thorcaill it is Mac Ailein, described as Mac Ailein Bharbhais (the son of Allan of Barvas):

<gai>Cha b’e dìth brochain no arain
chuir Mac Ailein air imrich,
ach nach bi fois aig an t-seillean
a theannas dol iomrall.<eng> (AML)

(58) The tradition given to the writer with this verse states that the subject of it was Iain mac Thorcaill, and that he was a MacLeod, a man of note in his day, who was thinking of taking another tack (baile) in place of the one he had. It is known that John MacLeod, tacksman of Haclet, Bernera, was Iain mac Thorcaill by patronymic, and descendants of his can be traced (FEP; GP; AML). Early in the eighteenth century he and Norman MacLeod, Garrabost, were the only MacLeod tacksmen in Lewis (FEP). In 1726 John MacLeod depones that he has been tacksman of Haclet for forty years, and signs the deposition in a good hand (ibid.). With John Morison’s advice to him compare the proverb, Is buidhe le amadan imrich.—“Fules are aye fond o’ flittin.” (NGP, 221.)

Variant: the verse is so frequently met with that it would serve no useful purpose to have written down variants from all the above sources; but it is given in two main versions with minor variations, the version given in the text, and another, which runs as follows:

<gai>Marbhaisg ort, Earraich,<eng>			[Marbhaist, DT
<gai>le d’ chrìonadh ’s le d’ chrannadh,<eng>	[chaoile … ghainne, DT
<gai>an uair nach dèan bean air éiginn<eng>	[ach air éiginn, DT
<gai>aithn’ air a ceud duine clainne.<eng>

[TD 236]

To the same purpose is the saying:

<gai>Is ann a cheart éiginn ’s a dh’aindeoin
a dh’aithnicheas bean a ceud leanabh,
mar thuirt Iain mac Mhurchaidh mhic Ailein.—<eng>

It’s barely, and in spite of everything,
that a woman knows her first child,
as John son of Murdoch son of Allan said.
(NGP, 212.)

(81) See pp. xxxix-xl.

(82) There must be an element of doubt as to whether John Morison was the author in view of the fact that, in Uist and elsewhere, the verse occurs in some, but only in some, versions of a well known folk-tale, Uilleim, bi ’d shuidhe, also known as Cas-shiubhal an t-Sléibhe agus a’ Chailleach Bheurr. See p. xl and note 1.


ADDENDA

(83) See pp. xl, 198. There is a strange story about Mary Morison in DML which is also still current in Lewis. She is alleged to have gone, in place of her brother who was at college, to a hosting of the Earl of Seaforth in the guise of a man. The story has been elaborated with various details of more or less improbability, including the complications that ensued when a brother officer’s wife fell in love with her, and, on being rebuffed, accused her of seducing her, thereby making it necessary for her to give proof of her sex. There is even a verse about her adventure:

<gai>Nighean oighre Mhic Ailein
bha ’n cogadh na Spàine,
thàinig i slàn as gun dórainn.—<eng>

The daughter of Allan’s heir
who was in the Spanish war—
she returned from it whole and unscathed.

(This tradition, including the verse, was related to the writer by Angus MacLeod (Aonghus Phàdruig), South Bragar.) There is no reason to suppose that the Earl of Seaforth of the day ever led his clan on an expedition to Spain, and the verse looks as if it was composed long after the alleged event. If one were to seek for an element of truth in the story, it might be noted that Kenneth (Coinneach Og), fourth Earl of Seaforth, must have called out the clan when he was in rebellion against the new Williamite régime in 1692 (W. C. MacKenzie, History of the Outer Hebrides, 392), and that Mary Morison’s brother John was a student at Edinburgh University at that time (see p. 196).

(84) This may have been Dr Kenneth MacIver, who was medical officer in Seaforth’s Regiment during the Sheriffmuir campaign in 1715 (Morrison’s MS. Traditions, Vol. 6; W. C. MacKenzie, The Western Isles, 148) with the rank of lieutenant (Seaforth MSS. in British Museum). He was tacksman of Carloway (FEP). He

[TD 237]

appears on record as “Mr Kenneth McIver” (Commissariot of the Isles: Testament of John MacKenzie of Assynt) and was known to tradition as Maighstir Coinneach (Campbell, Account of the Clan Iver, 104), signifying that he was a Master of Arts. (According to Mr Angus MacLeod, late schoolmaster at, and native of, Carloway, he is known to current tradition there as Coinneach Ruadh.) He was a student at King’s College, Aberdeen, in 1694 (DP, Book 1314, fol. 10r), and was no doubt the “Kenethus Mackeiver” who graduated there in 1697 (King’s College Officers and Graduates). As far as is known, he was the only qualified medical man in Lewis in his day. He spent some time in France with William, fifth Earl of Seaforth, and was known thereafter as Coinneach Frangach—“ffrench Kenneth” in a contemporary reference (Morrison’s Traditions, vol. 9; Seaforth MSS., ut supra).

(85) gholl: peculiar as a verb. The corresponding adjective gollach, on the other hand, is common parlance in Lewis in the sense of “blear-eyed”.

(86) Source: DML. It should be noted, as tending to cast doubt on the ascription to John Morison’s daughter, that the following is found in a Uist source without any ascription:

<gai>An searrach bu chòir bhith ’san làir
’s ann a dh’fhàs e anns a’ ghearran.—<eng>

The foal that should be in the mare,
it grew in the gelding.

(94) The source is The Highlander, issue of 18th July 1879, and the contributor was “D.C.M.”, i.e., Donald C. Macpherson, of the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh.

(95) The sources are GB I, 160; Carm. Gad. II, 298. In the latter source there are the following variants: 1d ’S cha mho gheobh; 2c Ach leanaidh am breabadair ris a gharman; 2d Is leanaidh an t-armadh.

(96) Beam and sley are parts of a loom. The meaning is that the habits of a lifetime cling to one to the end.
