ABBREVIATIONS AND SOURCES

At the end of each entry below are added the numbers, as used in this collection, of the poems which occur in the source concerned.

CC A. Maclean Sinclair, Clarsach na Coille, Glasgow 1881; 12, 14, 15, 19, 20.

CW The Carmichael-Watson collection of manuscripts in Edinburgh University Library: these had belonged to various collectors, including Alexander Carmichael, W. J. Watson and J. C. Watson; for details see Mackechnie, Catalogue I, pp. 455 ff. The manuscripts used here are nos. 210 (written by W. J. Watson) and 297 (written by Alexander Cameron, editor of RC), and W. J. Watson’s notes on poem no. 4 here are quoted from MS 204; 6, 9.

The Harp of Caledonia, Glasgow n.d. (see Maclean, Typographia,

[DA 30]

p. 149). This little book contains much in common with Mackenzie’s Cruiteara Gaelach (see below), and much in common also with another small anonymous collection, Co’chruinneachadh de Dh’ Oranan Taghta, published by Duncan Macvean, Glasgow 1836. The copy of The Harp of Caledonia in Aberdeen University Library contains an advertisement for Sinclair’s Òranaiche, to be published in October 1876; 14.

HM The manuscript collection of poems made by Dr Hector Maclean of Grulin, who died about 1784 according to The Clan Gillean, pp. 445-446; BL, p. 5. A note by Maclean Sinclair at the beginning of the manuscript tells us that he had it rebound in 1891, but that on the original cover the date 1768 was stamped, but this does not mean that the manuscript is to be dated to that year. It was already in progress by 1738 (Thomson, Introduction, p. 145; SGS VIII, p. 10) and may represent a lifetime of collecting. After Dr Maclean’s death, his daughter gave the manuscript to John Maclean, the compiler of JM, who took it with him to Nova Scotia in 1819. It is now in the Public Archives in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and for the present collection I have used the photocopy (MS 2318) in Aberdeen University Library; 1, 2, 6, 8-10, 12, 14-17, 20.

Inv The photostat numbered Acc 1994 in the National Library (see Mackechnie, Catalogue I, p. 324). This is a copy of a manuscript in the Inverneill Papers, which are at present in the possession of Dr J. L. Campbell of Canna. Dr Campbell tells me that he has no evidence as to the date of the manuscript apart from the fact that it contains a lament on the death in 1742 of Iain Ruadh nan Cath, 2nd Duke of Argyll, and a Fàilte for his successor; 9.

JM The manuscript collection of poems made by John Maclean (1787–1848), the Tiree bard who emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1819, taking both JM and HM with him. The date of JM is usually given as c. 1815 or c. 1816 (BL, p. 7). For his grandson’s account of his life see The Clan Gillean, pp. 339-341; CC, p. xiii. The manuscript is now in the Public Archives in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and I have used the microfilm copy (MF. 5) in Aberdeen University Library; 6, 7, 11, 19.

According to Maclean, Typographia, p. 178, the editor was the Reverend Duncan MacCallum, Arisaig; 19.

ML The manuscript collection of the Reverend James MacLagan (1728–1805), made during the second half of the 18th century and now in Glasgow University Library: for details see Mackechnie, Catalogue I, pp. 412 ff. Many of the poems in this collection are in versions close to those of MN. The manuscripts used here are nos. 222A and 227, both written by MacLagan himself; 4, 6.

MN The manuscript collection of the Reverend Donald MacNicol (1735–1802), made during the second half of the 18th century and later added to. Some of the manuscripts are now in the National Library, Acc 2152, and are numbered from 1 to 77, while others are in Edinburgh University Library among the papers of the Reverend Colin Campbell of Achnaba (1644–1726) and are numbered from A to S (though it is not certain that MSS D-S had all belonged to MacNicol). The manuscripts used here are MS 52 in the National Library and MS C in Edinburgh University Library. For further details see Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, pp. xvii-xviii; BSC, p. xxviii; 4, 19.

N Manuscript 72.2.15, formerly MS LXV, in the National Library. It is perhaps to be dated to around 1750 (see BSC, pp. xxix-xxx), being written in the old “Irish”

[DA 32]

hand: in the Sources and Readings here, letters which are represented in the old hand by various contractions and symbols are given in italics. Mr Ronald Black informs me that the manuscript was written by the Kintyre scribe, Uilleam Mac Mhurchaidh, on whom see SGS XI, pp. 26 ff. See also Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 105; Mackechnie, Catalogue I, pp. 245 ff.; 6, 9.

Note on BL, CC, GB and GB2:

These collections by Maclean Sinclair often give readings which cannot be found in other extant versions of the poems. The editor seldom identifies his sources, but includes few poems which cannot be found elsewhere. In CC, however (pp. x-xi), he identifies HM and JM as sources for a number of poems, and a comparison of these with the manuscripts concerned shows that in many cases he has silently altered the text beyond simply regularising the spelling. This may have been done, as Dr Campbell suggests to me, in the interests of getting readily intelligible Gaelic poems into print speedily. In a letter to Counnduillie Morison, dated Jan. 26th, 1898, Maclean Sinclair says, referring to the forthcoming BL: “I have made a few trifling changes in the songs you sent me, partly to remove mistakes in composition, and partly to avoid repetitions in ideas or words. I have also thrown in a verse or two. I have not, however,

[DA 33]

changed the meaning of the songs. I have weakened the statement about Calum in Mrs MacAskill’s lines ‘Chuir mi suas mo ghùn bainnse’ [BL, p. 258]. I did not want to make it quite so clear as she made it that she cared nothing for Calum. The sheets are going off to Glasgow this week, where the book will be bound.” See also the remarks of Maclean Sinclair quoted here in the Notes for line 342.

Because of this attitude to sources, I have assumed in the case of all the poems dealt with here that the versions in Maclean Sinclair’s collections are derivative, and that significant divergences there from the older sources are due to changes made by him without authority.

I must nevertheless acknowledge my great debt to Maclean Sinclair’s work, which made my own very much easier.

EACHANN BACACH

1. ’S ann Di-Ciadain an Là

1.
’S ann Di-ciadain an là
Ghabh mi cead dhiot air tràigh:
Rìgh, gum faice mi slàn ’san eachraidh sibh,

2.
Air bhur pilleadh a rìs
Air reothart a’ lìon’						5
Gu Dubhairt bu rìoghail aigeannach,

3.
Shir Lachainn nam bàrc,
Chuireadh luingis air sàil,
Leis an taghar an càbhlach acfhuinneach;

4.
Le deagh-oighr’ Eachainn Òig,				10
Leis an éireadh na slòigh:
Nuair a leumadh do shròn cha b’fhalcaireachd.

5.
Clann Ghill-Eathain nach tlàth
Dhol an cogadh nan arm,
’S tric a bhuannaich sibh blàr: ’s e b’fhasan dhuibh.		15

6.
’S fada chluinnteadh bhur foirm
Agus … bhur gleòis,
Togail chreach ona’ chrò ’sa’ ghlasanaich.

7.
Nuair a spreagadh sibh pìob
’S fuaim bhur creach ga cur sìos,				20
Gum biodh crith air an tìr an tachradh sibh.

8.
Nuair a nochdadh sibh sròil
Ris na caol-chrannaibh stòir,
’S mairg a thachradh d’a dheòin roimh’n lasan sin.

[TD 3]

9.
An dùirn laochraidh gun leòn					25
Cuilbheir caol cruaidh gorm,
Fuaim shradaidh nan òrd toirt lasain dhaibh.

10.
Cinn gheala de’n stàil’nn
An glacaibh gun tàir,
Lann thana ’nan làimh gu sracaireachd.			30

11.
Fad ’s a bhitheas tu beò,
Glac an stiùir ann ad dhòrn;
Na mealladh fear seòid na beairte thu.

12.
Nuair a chì thu muir mór
Is e tighinn fo chròic,						35
Ceann-fiodha cha chòir machnadh (?) air.

13.
’S fada chluinnteadh fuaim theud
An àm luighe do’n ghréin,
Mnathan grinne cur gréis air fasanan.

14.
’S mi bhiodh cinnteach as d’fheum				40
Ann am beanntan na seilg,
’S do choin earbsach air éill roimh’n chamhanaich.

15.
Nàmhaid eilid nan gleann
Agus bradain nan allt;
Sgiobair fairg’ thu ’s muir àrd ’san langanaich.		45

16.
Och a Mhoire, mo chràdh
Mu Chlann Ghill-Eathain nam bàrc!
’S e mo chreach mar tha ’n tràghadh seachad oirbh.

Mhic Moire na gréine,
A ghiùlain do cheusadh,					50
’S tu m’aighear is m’eudail ’s mo threòir.

Oighre dligheach na h-aitribh,
Nam pìob is nam brataichean sròil.

3.
An Dùn Éideann nan caisteal					55
Tha ceannard treun na mór aitim:
’S ann ded’ bheus a bhith sgapadh an òir;

4.
Is nach b’urrainn dod’ dhùthaich
Chur ad ghlacaibh de chùinne
Na chosgadh tu chrùintibh mu’n bhòrd.			60

5.
Gur buidheach na h-éisgean
De dh’uasal an éididh:
Leat gun guidh iad buaidh threun anns gach tòir.

6.
Chuid de’n chléir-se chaidh seachad,
’S ann mud’ réidhlean gum faight’ iad;			65
’S fad ’s is cian thug luchd astair ort sgeòil.

7.
Crann gun doicheall gun euradh,
’S tric a chosgas na ceudan,
D’am bu dorsaireachd féile tràth nòin.

8.
Bhiodh fir Mhuile mud’ bhrataich,				70
’S ann mud’ ghualainn gum faight’ iad;
Bu nì duilich am fasdadh ’s do leòn.

Bogha ’n iubhar dhearg-dhathte
Chùil bhuidh’ thig á Sasann,
Ghabhadh lughadh ’s nach spealtadh ’san dòrn.

Pìc iadhaidh nam meallan
Mar a’ ghrian ’s i gun smal oirr’				80
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

12.
Fiùbhaidh chinnteach chruaidh fhallain,
’S i gun fhiar anns gach geal-làimh:
Bhith ga pianadh b’e leannan gach seòid.

13.
Bhiodh na gallain bu daoire					85
Cruaidh sgalanta caoineil;
Glac eàrr is cinn ladhrach o’n òrd.

Gan aiseag thar chaoiltean,
Clann bharrail dheas aobhaidh Mhic Leòid.

1.
Is beag aobhar mo shùgraidh
’S chan eil sunnd orm ri macnas,

2.
O nach tadhail mi ’n othail,
’S gur h-i mheodhail seo chleachd mi.			100

3.
Is mi sealltainn air Dubhairt,
Leam is dubhadh a faicinn,

4.
’S gura minic a bhà mi
’Na taighibh àrd’ anns a’ mhadainn;

5.
’S mi ri sealltainn Earra-ghàidheal,				105
Is bàrr dearg air a h-aitribh.

6.
Càit am faic mi rim’ shaoghal
Fear aogaisg Shir Lachainn?

7.
Dol an coinneamh do nàmhad
Bu neo-ràtanach tais thu.					110

8.
Togail suas am bragàda
Bu neo-sgàthach air each thu.

9.
Ge b’e chitheadh do dhaoine,
Rìgh, bu ghreadhnach am faicinn,

10.
Le musgacha dubh-ghorm					115
’S iad gun sùith orr’ gun deatach.

Ged a dh’fhàg mi mo bhràithrean
Anns an àraich gan casgairt,

14.
Chan e siod tha mi ’g àireamh,
Ach sàr-mhac Shir Lachainn

15.
Bhith an làimh aig luchd Beurla,				125
’S nach d’fheud thu dhol as orr’.

4. A’ Chnò Shamhna

1.
Thriall bhur bunadh gu Phàro;
Có b’urrainn d’a sheanchas					130
Ach Mac Mhuirich, Mac Fhearghais?
Craobh a thuinich ré aimsir,
Fhreumhaich bun ann an Albainn;
Chuidich fear dhiubh Cath Gairbheach:
Fhuair sinn ulaidh fear th’ainme theachd beò.		135

2.
Cha chraobh chuire, cha phlannta,
Cha chnò ’n uiridh o’n d’fhàs thu;
Cha bhlàth chuirteadh mu Bhealltainn,
Ach fàs duillich is meanglain,
Am meur mullaich seo dh’fhàg sinn:				140
Cuir, a Chrìosd, tuilleadh an àite na dh’fholbh.

3.
Is mór pudhar an ràidh-se,
’S trom an dubhadh-sa dh’fhàs oirnn;
Gura cumhang leinn t’fhàrdach,
Leaba luighe nan clàraidh:					145
’S fhad as cuimhne leinn càradh nam bòrd.

4.
Cha do bhrist thu chnò shamhna—
Chaidh do chiste ’n taigh geamhraidh;
Misneach fear Innse Gall thu;
’S mór as misde do ranntaibh					150
Nach do chlisg thu roimh armailt—
Rìgh, bu mhiosail thu ’n campa Mhontròis.

Fhir bu rìoghaile cleachdadh,
’S tu bu bhìoganta faicinn
A’ dol sìos ann am machair;					155
Bhitheadh mìltean mud’ bhrataich,
Chuid bu phrìseil de’n eachraidh;
Luchd do mhì-rùin nan caist’ ort
’S ann a dh’innsteadh leò t’fhasan
Nuair bu sgìth leò cur sgapadh ’nam feòil.			160

6.
Gum bu sgipidh neo-chearbach
Thigeadh do phistil ’s do chairb’nn ort
Air chrios breac nam ball airgid;

O’n là chuala mi naidheachd mo leòin.

Tha do chadal sàmhach buan,
Gu aiseirigh ’n t-sluaigh o’n bhàs;				1415
’S àghmhor a’ chabhair a rug ort
O anacair ghoirt ’s o chràdh.

8.
Tha mo dhòchas ann an Crìosd,
’N Tì dhìol air son peacadh chàich,

Gu bheil t’anam nochd ’na bhlàths.

9.
Cuid eile chùis m’éibhnis mhóir
Nach d’fhaod gum b’e bhith beò do chàs;
Bhith foirfe ’n naomhachd gun spot,
Gun pheacadh gun lochd gu bràch.				1425

10.
Còmhdhail shòlasach le chéile
Tha mi guidhe Dhé de ghràs
Bhith agam-sa ’s agad fhéin
An talla ’n éibhnis ’s an àigh.

An creideamh nam pong-se fhéin,				1430
An dùil éisteachd anns a’ chàs,
Tha ’m rùn-sa fuireach rim’ ré
Gun monmar gun éis gun chràd.

Cha robh do theanga-se luath:
Có de’n t-sluagh d’an tug i beum?				1435
B’fhurasda dhomh cliù thoirt ort
Nach coisneadh a h-uile té.

13.
Ach o nach eil m’ùidh-s’ ann an sgleò,
’S nach mò th’ agad-sa air feum,
Fanaidh mi tuilleadh am thàmh:				1440
Ach mo bheannachd gu bràch ’nad dhéidh.

SOURCES AND READINGS

1. ’S ANN DI-CIADAIN AN LÀ

My only source for this poem is HM, p. 106, from which it has also been printed (omitting stt. 10 and 12) in CC, p. 194, GB, p. 44, and BL, p. 35.

2. IORRAM DO SHIR LACHANN

My only primary source for this poem is HM, p. 107, from which it has been printed in GB, p. 41, and BL, p. 32. In HM st. 4 is followed by an earlier version of st. 5, which is stroked out, though remaining legible, and replaced by a slightly different one. The first two lines of each stanza are written as one. In the second lines of stt. 1-15, and in the third lines of stt. 2, 3 and 5, meaningless vocables were inserted by the scribe after the poem had been written out: see Metres and Tunes.

A shar chosbuinn na troideadh,

4. A’ CHNÒ SHAMHNA

For this poem I have used four sources which are, in whole or in part, independent of each other:

HM p. 101: This contains stt. 1-5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 8 (second version, slightly different from the first), 13-15, 17, 18, 20-22.

MN MS 52: The beginning of the poem in this has been torn off. The surviving part begins with the last four lines of st. 15 (from line 229), after which come stt. 8, 5, 11, 20, 3, 10, 4, 9, 21, 22, 2. These verses are in the same order as the corresponding ones in the original ML version (see below), so that

[TD 126]

probably one derives (perhaps indirectly) from the other. Since the original ML text is in a more normal spelling than MN, it seems fair to suggest (a) that MN is the older text, and (b) that only three and a half verses are missing from the beginning of the MN text.

Undoubtedly the missing stanzas are those appearing in MN MS 18, as listed by Mackechnie (Catalogue, I, p. 332), where there are three seven-line stanzas and three further lines: the first three stanzas in the original ML version (see below) are also of seven lines each. But MS 18 is now (1975) missing from the MacNicol Papers in the National Library, and I have been unable to use it. The ascription to Pàl Crùbach in MN MS 18 also indicates that the version there was close to that in ML.

ML MS 222A, 27th page: As first written, this version was very close to that of MN, but there are numerous additions, also in MacLagan’s hand, which may derive from a version showing some similarities to that of HM and E. These consist of additional lines or groups of lines added between lines or stanzas of the original text, and extra stanzas added at the end. These additions are referred to here as ML2.

Stanzas occurring in the original version (ML) are: 1, 14, 6, 15, 8, 5, 11, 20, 3, 10, 4, 9, 21, 22, 2. After the version of st. 2, the words “a Chrioch” are added, but stroked out.

The additional stanzas (ML2) are: a version of part of st. 10 added between stt. 11 and 20; and the following added after the version of st. 2: 7, 12, 13, 17 and a stanza made up of the first four lines of st. 19 and the last three of st. 18.

The verses throughout are numbered, but not consecutively: this numbering is probably part of the ML2 emendation.

E, p. 85: It is argued in Scottish Gaelic Studies XII, pp. 217-219, that this text is mainly copied from HM, and that some text akin to MN/ML was also seen. But there is also one stanza (16) which is not derived from any of the texts listed above. Stanzas occurring in E are: 1-5, 7, 8, 14, 15, 9, 16, 10; a stanza made up of the first three lines of st. 17 and three lines similar to the last three of st. 18; st. 19; a stanza made up of the first three lines of st. 18 and the last three of st. 17; stt. 20-22.

Other extant versions of the poem appear to be derived from one or more of the above. The version in Macleoid’s Collection (1811), p. 133, and that in SO, p. 77, are probably derived from E, and that in GB, p. 45, and BL, p. 37, from both HM and E. The

[TD 127]

version in BG, p. 205, is edited (see p. xiii) from E, GB, SO, MN and BL. A version of st. 20 in Morison MS A (see Introduction, Section 2) may be derived from BL.

The version given here follows HM as closely as possible. St. 6 is added from ML (the only source I have for it), as is st. 11 (see Notes, line 195); st. 16 is added from E (the only source I have for it), as is st. 19 (see Notes, line 250).

6. ÒRAN DO SHIR EACHANN

I have used five sources which provide primary material for this poem:

N, pp. 10-11, which has the stanzas as follows: 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 15, 12, 3, 7, 8, 4. Three further lines are added at the end, see Notes. There is no title or ascription. The stanzas are written each in four long lines.

HM, pp. 98-100: stt. 1-5, 7-11, 13-17.

ML MS 227, 5th page: stt. 1, chorus, 8, 7, 3, 5, 15; lines 468-469, 474-475; stt. 4, 12. There is no ascription.

E, p. 178: stt. 1-5, 7-9, 11-17. There is no ascription.

JM, pp. 301-306: chorus, stt. 1-17, chorus. The following note precedes the poem on p. 300: “Bha n’ t oran she lennas, air a chuir Shios, aunn an Comh-chruineachadh, Raonuil Donalaich, agus she riasan a thug dhomhsa, chuir aun sa ’n fhear sheo, gu’n duair mi da raunn, dheth nach rodh aunn, sa leobhar eile.” On p. 301 Maclean Sinclair has written: “See Red Book page 224”; I have failed to trace this reference.

Another version of the chorus and st. 1 may be found in M. 566, where they are given with the tune (see Metres and Tunes). According to Mackechnie (Catalogue I, p. 64.311) there is a copy of st. 3 in National Library MS 50.2.1 (J. F. Campbell, 1861).

The text mainly followed here is that of HM, the oldest reasonably full version. Stt. 6 and 12 are supplied, as far as possible, from N, and inserted according to the order in JM, the only complete version. Deviations from this scheme are explained in the notes.

It is argued in SGS XII, pp. 216-217, that E is derived from HM with relatively minor amendments, except for the E version of st. 12, for which I can trace no source. JM appears to be mainly a revised copy of E, but st. 10 there may have been taken

[TD 133]

from HM. The version of st. 6 in JM seems to be independent of that in N.

On the chorus given here see note on line 376. This chorus is taken from ML, the oldest source containing a chorus, but there is another form of it in JM and SO (see Metres and Tunes). Since E has no chorus, it may well be that the version of the poem in SO, p. 386, has been arrived at using some other source in addition to E, but all the verses there are consistent with derivation from E alone, with emendations.

The version in GB, p. 50, and BL, p. 41, is basically that of JM, but Maclean Sinclair also had access to HM and E. J. C. Watson (Mary Macleod, p. xxxiv) says the GB version is “better” than either E or N, but the GB version owes something to the emendations of Maclean Sinclair. The versions in the collections of Macpharlain (1813; p. 82) and Meinne (1870; p. 221) are taken from E.

A version of five stanzas (6-9, 15) appears in Dick, Bàrdachd gu a Mìneachadh, p. 102; this, Mr Dick tells me, is taken from Thomson, Gaelic Poems for Interpretation, p. 94, where the source is named (p. 95) as the Scottish Leaving Certificate (Higher) Examination paper for 1953. These verses are almost certainly derived from the BL version.

CW MS 210 has a typed version of this poem, the work of W. J. Watson: it is a copy of E in normalised spelling, with notes on the N version. It was probably intended originally for inclusion in BG (1918), for above it are written the words “Not now relevant” and “see Gaelic Bards I.50 A. M. Sinclair”.

A few comments on the N version are offered by Ewen MacLachlan in National Library MS 72.3.4, and these are quoted by Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 213. MacLachlan, Mackinnon and Mackechnie (Catalogue I, p. 245.7-8) take the N version to be two separate poems, the first on p. 10 (stt. 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 15, 12) and the second on p. 11 (stt. 3, 7, 8, 4). In the case of the “first poem” MacLachlan refers, quite correctly, to E, p. 178; in the case of the “second poem” he refers to E, p. 107, apparently believing that these stanzas were part of Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh’s Luinneag Mhic Leòid (Watson ed., p. 36; cf. ibid., p. xxxiv; TGSI XLI, p. 20).

9. ASCAOIN MOLAIDH NA PÌOBA

This poem is edited from four manuscript sources, all perhaps of the mid-18th century: N, p. 7; TM, p. 62; Inv, p. 7; HM, p. 42. TM makes no ascription of authorship, and has been printed in RC, p. 340; lines 684-699, copied from TM by Alexander Cameron, author of RC, are also to be found in CW MS 297 (see Mackechnie, Catalogue I, p. 526). The HM version appears, much emended, in GB, p. 126, and in BL, p. 69.

All four versions are closely similar to one another, and N and TM were written by the same scribe, though N is in the old hand and their versions are by no means identical. Inv and TM have perhaps the closest similarities of text. HM has the only complete text, though it seems to me the poorest of the four, for the other versions omit lines 700-703, Inv ending line 699 with “&c-”. I have therefore chosen to follow the N text as far as it goes (since TM is already in print) and to supply lines 700-703 from HM.

In N and Inv the stanzas are written as four lines, in TM as eight lines, and in HM there is a mixture of both forms (see Metres and Tunes). In HM there is a large space on p. 42 between stt. 2 and 3.

10. UAM-S’ THA RÀITINN

My only source for this poem is HM, p. 64, from which derives the version in GB2, p. 3, and in BL, p. 79: in these stt. 13, 15, 18 and 19 are omitted. This is probably explained by the

[TD 141]

note written by Maclean Sinclair at the end of the poem in HM, p. 66:

“Jan 8. 1887.—I have finished copying the above poem. I have found it more difficult than any other in the book. Of verse 15 I can make nothing. I have now copied out everything in this book. A. McL. S.”

It is some consolation to know that Maclean Sinclair too found this poem difficult. Because there are so many difficulties of interpretation, I give here the entire text as it appears in HM (pp. 64-66):

6b. The ’m was added to the left of the line after the line was written.

15b. The first letter of the first word is unclear to me: possibly l (ledh), but all other lines begin with capital letters; possibly S (Sedh); possibly l with a further letter before it.

15c. There is a mark, perhaps a correction, over Cion, but I cannot decipher it.

24c. The an was inserted after the rest of the line was written.

The text is printed here exactly as it appears in AB except for the following changes of the lettering: in AB the s in saor, sinnsreadh and sgeimh is the English “tall s”; the d in beirid and in all five instances of do, and the f in fhoghlum and mfuaim, are in the “Irish” form of print.


14. ÒRAN DO BHARBRA NIGHEAN EASBUIG FULLARTON

My only primary source for this poem is HM, p. 68, if it is accepted that the version in E, p. 300, is derived directly from HM, as is argued in SGS XII, pp. 213-214. The version in CC, p. 200, GB2, p. 2, and BL, p. 73, is probably derived from both HM and E. Ten stanzas (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 9-12) appear in Mackenzie’s Cruiteara Gaelach, p. 20, and in the Harp of Caledonia, p. 22, and this version seems to me to be derived, with amendments, from E.

In all versions except those of CC, GB2 and BL we are instructed to repeat the last two lines of each stanza.

17. RAINN

This poem is given here exactly as it appears on the 7th page of the Preface of AB (apart from the title and one change in line 1200, see below). This is almost certainly the only primary source of the poem, but there is a version in HM, p. 72: it is here assumed that this derives ultimately from AB, though it may have come partly through oral sources, for it differs quite considerably from AB. We have no positive indication that any of the HM text is more likely than AB to represent the original text.

An emended version from AB, with an English translation, appears in Pattison, Gaelic Bards, p. 199, and the version in GB2, p. 58, and BL, p. 226, seems to be based on both AB and HM. The version in BG, p. 155 (see p. ix) is edited from AB and GB2.

19. ÒRAN GAOIL D’A LEANNAN

The three primary sources I have found for this poem are MN MS C, p. 21, JM, p. 137, and MCa, p. 166. Only JM ascribes the poem to Maighstir Seathan, MN having neither ascription nor title and MCa having no ascription. MN omits stt. 7 and 8, while MCa omits stt. 6 and 8, but adds four other lines (see below) not found in JM or MN.

The version in JM2, p. 179, clearly derives from JM: there are some differences but, until we have some evidence that JM2 used a second source, we must regard these as editorial emendations (cf. SGS XII, pp. 302-303). The version in CC, p. 291, and BL, p. 231, is probably based on both JM and JM2, but omits stt. 5 and 6.

The text here follows JM, the fullest version, admitting only two emendations from MN (lines 1351, 1382).

NOTES

1. ’S ANN DI-CIADAIN AN LÀ

This poem comes from HM, the only primary source I know, and has been printed from there in CC, p. 194, GB, p. 44, and BL, p. 35.

It is addressed to Sir Lachlann Maclean (line 7), 16th of Duart, and must date from the time after he had become “Sir”. He got this title on becoming a Baronet of Scotland or, as the title was more popularly known, Baronet of Nova Scotia. These baronetcies had been instituted in 1625 in order to encourage settlement in Nova Scotia, but few of the baronets actually went there (Laing, Royal Letters, Preface, p. 126). A letter written by king Charles I, dated November 17th, 1629, tells us that Sir William Alexander, leader of the Nova Scotia colonists, had made an agreement with some Highland chiefs by which they would be transported to Nova Scotia “for advancing the said plantatione, and for debordening that our kingdome of that race of people, which in former times hade bred so many troubles ther” (Patterson, “Sir William Alexander”, p. 96). This early plan for Highland Clearances came to nothing, but it is not at all impossible that Lachlann, or one of his predecessors, was among the leaders approached.

Lachlann is listed by one source as having become a baronet on September 3rd, 1631, and by another on February 13th, 1632, “with a grant of, presumably, 16,000 acres in Nova Scotia, entitled the Barony of New Morvaren, of which he had seizin in Feb. 1632” (G.E.C., Complete Baronetage II, p. 394; cf. p. 275). These lands seem to have been on the island of Anticosti in the St Lawrence estuary, now in the Province of Quebec, but then part of Nova Scotia (Campbell, Scotsman in Canada, p. 85), but I have found nothing to suggest that Sir Lachlann ever visited them, or any other part of Canada. In the Privy Council Register he is first called “bart.” on March 30th, 1632, whereas he is mentioned without “Sir” or “bart.” on September 22nd and December 15th, 1631 (2nd series, vol. IV, pp. 338, 674). This

[TD 154]

seems to make it more likely that he became a baronet on February 13th, 1632, than on September 3rd, 1631.

We can therefore conclude that the poem is to be dated after 1631 and before 1649, when Sir Lachlann died (see Notes on poem no. 4). St. 1 shows that it was probably composed on an occasion when Sir Lachlann had left Mull, possibly on the same expedition which gave rise to poem no. 2. But Sir Lachlann is likely to have left Mull on many occasions which we do not know about. For one thing, he was elected Member of Parliament for Tarbert in September, 1628. He was present at the session of Parliament which opened in Edinburgh on June 18th, 1633, and on June 28th agreed to the merging of the shires of Tarbert and Argyll, thus putting himself out of office (Times, Acts of Parliaments V, pp. 9, 12, 80-81). He was also absent from Mull during part of Montrose’s campaigns in 1645 (see note on line 152), and was imprisoned in Carrick Castle in Cowal for a year in 1647–1648 (see Introduction, Section 1).

It may be, however, that stt. 11 and 12, which give advice on the execution of his duties as chief in terms very similar to those used in giving advice to his son, Eachann Ruadh, on his accession as chief in 1649 (lines 269-275), suggest that the poem was composed shortly after Lachlann’s accession as chief. The date of this event is debatable (see Introduction, Section 2), but it is perhaps unlikely that the poet would call Lachlann “deagh-oighr’ Eachainn Òig” (line 10) if Eachann Mór, his brother and predecessor, were still alive: Eachann Mór died in 1634 or 1635 (Introduction, Section 2).

Lines 46-48 suggest that some disaster has befallen the Macleans, as indeed disasters continued to befall them right through the 17th century (see Notes on no. 10). Perhaps Eachann Bacach is referring to the fact that in 1634 Sir Lachlann found it necessary to borrow money, to accept Gilleasbuig Caoch, Lord Lorne, as surety for it, and to accept him also as his feudal superior in the traditional Duart lands of Aros and Brolas (see Introduction, Section 1; Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 245); line 33 might well support this suggestion that the disaster was to some extent a financial one.

All this might make a dating c. 1635 acceptable for the poem. On the other hand, it is not certain that stt. 11 and 12 provide any dating evidence at all, and it is quite possible that st. 16 refers to a disaster which had occurred, or begun, long before the poem was composed. We therefore cannot be sure that the

[TD 155]

poem is as early as 1635, or indeed that it is not as late as 1649.

Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832) knew a version of this poem, or an English translation of one. In April or May, 1809, he sent a letter from London to Mrs Marianne Maclean Clephane. She was the daughter and heir of Lachlann Maclean, 7th of Torloisk, who had died in 1799, and the widow of Major-General William Maclean Douglas Clephane, a native of Fife who had died in 1803 or 1804. Scott was the guardian of her three daughters, Margaret, Anna-Jane and Wilmina-Marianne (Clan Gillean, pp. 461-462; Grierson, Letters 1808-1811, p. 489, n.). The letter is as follows (Grierson, Letters 1808–1811, p. 189):

On my return home before dinner, finding I had half an hour good, I employed it in an attempt to versify the Macleans’ song. No English Rythm would suit the structure of the original, so I fear singing the lines at last to its own tune, is out of the question. However though the verses have this fault, besides being but indifferent otherwise, I hope, my dear Madam, the young ladies and you, will accept my attempt, as a trifling expression of my respect for the Clan, and my gratitude for the high pleasure I have received in your society particularly.
W.S.

The enclosure is as follows (Grierson, p. 190):

WAR-SONG OF THE MACLEANS
IMITATED FROM THE GAELIC

I
A weary month has wandered o’er
Since last we parted on the shore;
Heaven! that I saw thee, Love, once more,
Safe on that shore again.
’Twas bold Sir Lachlan gave the word,
Lachlan of many a galley Lord
He called his kindred bands on board
And launch’d them on the main.

II
Clan Gillian is to battle gone,
Clan Gillian fierce in foray known,
Rejoicing in the glory won
In many a former broil.
Full far is heard the thundering fray
The rout, the ruin, the dismay

[TD 156]

When from the twilight glens away
Clan Gillian drives the spoil.

III
Woe to the hills that shall rebound,
The bannered bag-pipes maddening sound,
Clangillian’s onset roaring round,
Shall shake their inmost cell.
And woe to him who stops to gaze
Where Lachlan’s silken streamer plays;
The fool might brave the lightning blaze
As wisely and as well.

This poem was later printed with some amendments, see Scott, Poetical Works, vol. 8, p. 395 (cf. J. P. Maclean, History of Clan MacLean, p. 420); there it is entitled: “War-song of Lachlan/High Chief of Maclean/from the Gaelic”, and is called “an imitation, or free translation”. A note preceding the poem there says: “This song appears to be imperfect, or, at least, like many of the early Gaelic poems, makes a rapid transition from one subject to another; from the situation, namely, of one of the daughters of the clan, who opens the song by lamenting the absence of her lover, to an eulogium over the military glories of the Chieftain. The translator has endeavoured to imitate the abrupt style of the original.” For some comment on this “abrupt style”, so common in 17th-century poetry, see Thomson, Introduction to Gaelic Poetry, p. 117.

It seems beyond dispute that the poem here being “imitated” is the present one, or at least stanzas 1 and 3-8 of it: in this connection it may be worth noting that the text as first written in HM omits st. 2, for which Scott seems to offer no “imitation”, and ends with st. 12 (see Sources and Readings). Scott’s letter and note seem to suggest that he had seen a version in Gaelic, perhaps supplied to him by Mrs Maclean Clephane (cf. Grierson op. cit., pp. 398-399).


1. For this line HM has ’S ann Diciadin, an la, and that this is the proper form of the line seems to be confirmed by the title ’S ann Di-ceudain an làth in MS 14949 (see Metres and Tunes). The line is taken here to be asyntactical, a combination of two expressions: ’S e Di-ciadain an là a ghabh mi cead dhiot and ’S ann Di-ciadain a ghabh mi cead dhiot. Both of these have practically the same meaning, which is taken here for the combined expression. The

[TD 157]

combination of the two syntactical expressions might have been facilitated by the fact that Di-ciadain is used as an adverb as often as it is used as a noun. There is a similar case of asyntaxis in line 829 here, see note.

Alternatively, however, as Mr Donald MacAulay suggests to me, the comma in the HM line may be of significance: the expression may be simply ’S ann Di-ciadain a ghabh mi cead dhiot, with an là added parenthetically, as an là sin might be added in prose, to emphasise Di-ciadain in some way, perhaps “that fateful day”.

3. HM seems to have eachri, though this is not quite clear. ’San eachraidh is, as Mr William Gillies points out to me, a rather “uncomfortable” reading; other possibilities he suggests are that eachri (?) represents a word for a time or period of time, such as earrach or (an) eararais, or a place, such as eachras, “house” (Armstrong) or eachdarra, “pen for confining straying cattle or sheep” (Dwelly), or a placename, or an adjective to which the preceding an- is a privative prefix; note also eachrais, “confusion, bustle” (Dwelly).

5. HM reads Ar reamhar a liun’dh, which is perhaps open to various explanations. Mr MacAulay suggests to me that the form liun’dh is intended to tell us that the word is a verbal noun and that it is monosyllabic. The dropping of the verbal noun ending -(e)adh is not unknown in Gaelic dialects, and the poet may here have adopted, metri causa, a colloquial form of lìonadh.

8. HM reads Lungis but, because HM frequently replaces almost any unstressed vowel with i, this may really represent loingeas; BL, GB and CC have luinge(a)s.

9. HM has toghar, which might also represent togthar, a literary form of togar, “is raised, is built”.

10. See above, and Introduction, Section 2. Eachann Òg, 14th of Duart and father of Eachann Mór and Sir Lachlann, made over his estate to Eachann Mór, 15th chief, in 1623 and lived until c. 1633. Eachann Mór in turn made the estate over to Sir Lachlann in 1630, and died in 1634 or 1635. Eachann Mór was thus never in control of the estate after his father’s death, and it may be that Eachann Bacach saw Sir Lachlann as the real successor of Eachann Òg. However, this is not necessarily so, as oighre may simply indicate that Lachlann eventually succeeded to his father’s place.

12. HM has alcearreachd. Armstrong defines falcaireachd as “scoffing; cheating”. Mr Gillies suggests a meaning close to

[TD 158]

“confidence trick” here, the reference perhaps being to a feigned anger by which lesser men might deceive an enemy.

It is also possible to take this stanza as quite independent of the previous one, and read it as: “Nuair a leumadh do shròn, cha b’fhalcaireachd le deagh-oighre Eachainn Òig …” On the change of person involved in this interpretation cf. note on line 425.

For the meaning “anger” in the phrase leumadh do shròn, see Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs II, line 1345 and note.

16. HM has fòirm, on which see note on line 129. For the meaning see BG, p. 367.

17. For the word omitted here HM has fòrruinn, for which Maclean Sinclair writes farram in the manuscript, and prints faram or farum in CC, GB and BL. There are various possibilities for the HM form, e.g. a form of Donnchadh Bàn’s forgan, “keenness, anger; stir, surge, riot; fury, passion” (Macleod ed., p. 487, n. 2736); Dwelly’s fòirinn, which he says can mean “strength” as well as “help, remedy”, etc.; a noun related to Maceachen’s verb fòirn, “intrude, force”; or perhaps a form of fòirne, plural of foireann, “a band, troop, etc.” The meaning of gleòis, genitive (?) of gleus (“activity” or “ranks”?), can perhaps only be ascertained when that of HM’s fòrruinn is known for certain. Scott (see above) may have understood fòrruinn to mean “rout” or “ruin” or “dismay”.

20. For the tentative interpretation offered here in the translation I am indebted to Mr William Gillies, who also suggests an alternative: “the sound of [tunes commemorating] your forays being played”.

23. Stòir is taken here, at Mr Gillies’ suggestion, as an adjectival use of a form (genitive?) of stòr, which is used to denote a mountain peak and (as in line 282 here) a prominent tooth.

27. HM has shràidh, but I can see no alternative to emending this to shradaidh. Maclean Sinclair writes stradag in the manuscript, and prints sradag. See also note on line 354.

30. HM has na laimh, so that the possessive might be singular; but the context, despite the singulars lann thana and làimh, seems to me to suggest a plural.

33. Seòid is here understood as genitive singular of seud, “instrument; way, path” (Dwelly), and possibly “means”, and fear seòid, like fear beairte, as “a crafty man”: the plural of beart can mean “works, feats”.

[TD 159]

34-35. Similar lines occur in a South Uist song in Tocher 27, p. 146.

36. Dwelly defines ceann-fiodha as “end of a ship timber”, and Ceunn (?) a fiù in HM must be a variant of this. For similar uses of ceann see Meek, Campbell Collection, no. 440.

HM seems to have Machnaodh, but the first letter is uncertain, though the remainder seems quite clear. I have tentatively taken the word as a form of Irish machnamh or machtnamh (Middle Irish machtnad), “to wonder; deliberate, reflect, imagine; ponder”. This word, however, is not otherwise attested in Scottish Gaelic, as far as I know, so that perhaps the initial group of marks in HM represent not M-, but something else: possibilities include Ne-, Ste-, Sle- and Fle- (fleachnadh for flichneadh ?); even seachnadh is perhaps a possibility. If machnadh is correct, the stanza may mean that when the entire ship (i.e. the Maclean inheritance, as in lines 263-275) is in danger one ought not to concern oneself with minor details, but give a firm lead against the main threat.

It is also possible, as Mr. Gillies and Mr MacAulay suggest to me, that, if HM’s scribe did write Machnaodh, the word he intended may have been something like meathnadh; this might have been a local form of meathadh, “withering, degenerating”, the intrusive -n- being comparable with the intrusive -l- in Dwelly’s verb meathlaich, and with the -n- in Armstrong’s meathanas, “consumption”.

37-39. Stanza 13 seems somewhat isolated here; it is clearly part of an episode, of a kind common in the seventeenth century, in which the subject’s generosity is praised by listing the lavish entertainments in his house in the evening. The stanza is not in the text as first written in HM, but this is true also of several other stanzas (see Sources and Readings).

On harping in Duart see note on line 237.

Line 39 (on which see also note on line 247) is reminiscent of a line by Iain Lom in a poem of 1647 (Mackenzie ed., line 509):

<gai>Mnài uchdgheal gruaidh-dhearga cur gréis.<eng>

Keating (Foras Feasa III, line 2770) has the line “gan inghean … ré cur síoda ná gréis”.

45. In a poem in ML MS 135B by “am Bàrd Asantach”, addressed to Iain Molach, 2nd MacKenzie of Applecross, who succeeded in 1646 and died in the 1680s (Mac Phàrlain, Lamh-Sgrìobhainn, p. 156), we find the lines:

[TD 160]

<gai>
B’e t fhasan bhi sa bheinn sin
’Ga ’m bi na feidh san langanaich.
<eng>


2. IORRAM DO SHIR LACHANN

This poem is taken from HM, whence it has been printed in GB, p. 41, and BL, p. 32. The subject is identified only in the title.

Sir Lachlann is absent in Edinburgh, and it is possible that it was during the same absence that no. 1 was composed; but, even if this could be shown, it does not help to date the poem (see Notes on no. 1). Stanza 2, here, however, may suggest that Sir Lachlann’s predecessor, his brother Eachann Mór, has now died and that Lachlann is being urged by the poet to return to his inheritance. This might date the poem to 1634 or 1635 (see Introduction, Section 2), and there is nothing to make such a date unlikely. On the other hand, the poem might have been composed at any time during Sir Lachlann’s chiefship, if st. 2 is not to be interpreted strictly as suggested above. On the meaning of Iorram in the title see Metres and Tunes.


53. Aitreabh, usually masculine, is marked feminine by Macalpine and appears as feminine in a poem by Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Watson ed., line 247). The gender varies also in Irish (Dinneen).

56. In the photocopy of HM the end of the word aitim is obliterated and only at … is legible. Maclean Sinclair was presumably able to read the whole word when the manuscript was in his possession, and he reads aitim in BL. On the history of this word see SGS II, p. 15.

60. For chosgadh HM has chosce. The verb, also used in lines 605 and 1224, is that given by Dwelly as cosd, but it often appears in the dialects as cosg (e.g. Wagner, Linguistic Atlas IV, p. 237, no. 1023, and p. 241).

64. HM has Chud don chlérs chuigh shechud. I have taken the -s of chlérs to be the demonstrative enclitic used as a relative: for other instances of this see note on line 488. Mr Donald MacAulay suggests to me, however, that it may be that in this case the -s represents the form is (for agus) as used in expressions like uiread is a tha agam, “as much as I have”; uibhir is a tha ann, “as much as there is”; a mheud is a bhean ris, “as many as

[TD 161]

touched him”. Cuid, being similar in meaning to uiread, uibhir and meud, may have appropriated some of their syntax.

Eachann Bacach may be drawing a distinction between the éisgean of line 61 (RIA Contribb. éicse, “the poetic profession, the bardic order; poets”; Dwelly eisg, “satirist, lampooner, scurrilous poet”) and cliar, which Dwelly defines as “poet” and the RIA Contribb. as “company, band, train, troop (especially of a poet’s following)”.

68. HM has choscus, and Watson (BG, p. 355) gives the meaning of this cosg as “put an end to; hence, fulfil, serve”. But Professor Thomson suggests to me that the meaning might equally well be that used in line 60: “Who often spends hundreds (of gold coins)”.

72. HM has i’ fasta, which might also be understood as a fasdadh.

75. HM has chaisd, taken here as the imperfect passive form of the verb cas, “turn”. The passive of this verb, followed by various prepositions, may be used for “meet (with)” in Classical Gaelic (see RIA Contribb. s.v. casaid), and is usual for this meaning in Irish. There is another use of the same form in line 158.

76-77. De’n iubhar dhearg-dhathte and a’ chùil bhuidhe are here taken as parallel adjectival phrases qualifying bogha; it was thus the bow, not simply the cùl, which came from England. Hodgkin (Archer’s Craft, p. 35) tells us that the longbow, presumably the type described here, was “to all intents and purposes an English monopoly”. This interpretation of the lines, however, has syntactical difficulties, but these seem to me unresolvable: to emend iubhar to iubhair (genitive) would also leave syntactical questions unanswered.

Reference to the bow being dathte (? coloured) is found also in line 309, and the bow is said by Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 124) to be made of red yew. The wood of the Common or English Yew (taxus baccata) is described as “satiny red” (Hadfield, British Trees, p. 9), so that dearg-dhathte here probably means simply “red (-coloured)”, rather than implying that the bow had been reddened by any staining or painting process.

In a poem of 1651 (E, p. 234, st. X; BL, p. 267) we have the line “Le ’m boghachaibh cul bhuidh”; Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines 19, 122) twice mentions bogha ’n t-sàr chùil. Hodgkin (p. 86) distinguishes between the “back” and the “belly” of a bow, the former, evidently, being the extremities of the stave, which are nearest the archer when shooting, and the latter the middle part,

[TD 162]

which is pushed outwards by the archer. Due to natural weakening of the wood (especially if the yew used is English) after the bow has been bent many times, it is sometimes necessary to provide a “backing” for these extremities: Hodgkin says (p. 99) “the ideal backing is vellum, which is calf-skin cleaned and prepared …” This would give us, I suggest, a reasonable explanation of the word cùl (the “backing”, perhaps, rather than the “back”), and a reason why it might be yellow, if Hodgkin’s suggestion about vellum reflects long-standing practice.

78. For lughadh HM has luaodh, and Maclean Sinclair writes lubadh in the margin. On the word lughadh, also in line 223 here, see BG, p. 375.

79. On the frequent use of pìc for “bow” see note on line 309. Iain Lom has the line pìc rìomhach nam meallan in a poem of post 1678 (Mackenzie ed., line 1870).

HM appears to have iehi, presumably representing iathaidh. This seems to be a genitive, used adjectivally, of iadhadh, which Armstrong says can mean “stretching, as a bow”.

80. What seems to be the letter o is inserted in HM above the space between mar and ghrian: the line in HM is mar ghrian ’s gun small or. This o is here taken to be an error, since the o, representing meaningless vocables inserted in the text when sung (see Metres and Tunes), is inserted again in its proper place between ’s and gun. For the interpretation of the line I am indebted to Professor Thomson.

81. This line in HM consists merely of a row of crosses, and BL fills it as follows: ’Chuireadh naimhdean gu talamh fo leon.

82. The arrow is also referred to as fiùdhaidh by Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines 1195, 2116); see also ibid., p. 411, line 94, and BG, p. 366.

83. Leannan is taken here to denote the thing which is desired; cf. Dwelly’s leannan òinsich, “an idiot’s choice”.

86. HM has caonoil, here taken, at Professor Thomson’s suggestion, as a variant of caoin in its meaning “dry, seasoned”.

91-93. This may be a reference to the fact that Sir Lachlann’s wife was Mary, daughter of Ruaidhri Mór (d. 1626), 13th MacLeod of Dunvegan, and sister of the current MacLeod chief, Iain Mór (d. 1649). Sir Lachlann’s brother and predecessor, Eachann Mór, had in 1623 married Mary’s sister Margaret (Clan Gillean, p. 252; Macleod, Book of Dunvegan I, p. 55). On the close relationship between the Macleans and the MacLeods at this time see SGS XII, p. 196, and note.

[TD 163]

Perhaps line 93 is to be translated rather as “the matchless, handsome, genial children of the MacLeod chief”.

94-96. This stanza differs from st. 15 in being in the past tense. It may therefore be that the reference is specifically to Cailean Ruadh, 1st Earl of Seaforth, who died on April 5th, 1633. According to The Clan Gillean, p. 252, he was Sir Lachlann’s uncle, his sister Janet having been Sir Lachlann’s mother (but see Mackenzie, History of Clan Mackenzie, p. 246). Possibly the poet here refers to documents relating to the marriage of Janet and Eachann Òg, but there were probably numerous other relevant documents. Mull tradition in the 17th century was very conscious of historical and genealogical links between the Macleans and the MacKenzies (see TGSI XXXIX/XL, pp. 217, 224).

A Maclean chief is said (Mackenzie, History, p. 244) to have paid court to Cailean Ruadh while the latter was on a circuit of the islands and, though no date is specified, it is not impossible that Sir Lachlann was the visitor.


3. IS BEAG AOBHAR MO SHÙGRAIDH

This poem is taken from HM, which is the only primary source I have for it, and from which it has been printed in GB, p. 57, and BL, p. 49. A version of lines 124-128 appears also in the JM version of poem no. 6 here (lines 423-427; see Sources and Readings): the version of these lines in no. 6 here, which is based mainly on N, also has similarities to lines 121-128. Lines 107-108 are strongly reminiscent of lines 472-473.

I cannot date this poem with any confidence, and have placed it no. 3 on what amounts to little more than a guess that its date may be 1647. This dating depends on the assumption that the poem, as we have it, is not corrupt and contains no lines which were not originally part of it, and also on the assumption that lines 107-108 do not necessarily carry an implication that Sir Lachlann is dead (he died in 1649, see no. 4, Notes).

In July, 1647, Sir Lachlann was forced to surrender the castles of Duart and Aros to Sir David Leslie (see line 209, note), and Maclean Sinclair says (Clan Gillean, pp. 189-190) that he also gave Leslie his son, Eachann Ruadh, as a pledge of his fidelity. But the captivity of Eachann Ruadh is explained differently by other historians (“Seneachie”, p. 148; J. P. Maclean, History of Clan MacLean, p. 174; Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I,

[TD 164]

p. 135). These say that the Earl of Argyll had kidnapped Eachann Ruadh from his school in Dumbarton as the army passed through the town, and threatened to kill him if his father did not surrender. The Clan Gillean (p. 190) rejects this account apparently on the grounds that Eachann, being aged about 20 at this time, would not have been at school, and that Argyll, though greedy and crafty, was not a murderer.

The details of the captivity, of course, do not affect the dating of the poem. I do not know how long Eachann Ruadh was held captive, but to date the poem tentatively to 1647 would account for the captivity in lines 124-126, and would also explain the poet’s apparent inability to visit Duart (lines 99-100). See, however, note on line 128 below.

But various other datings for the poem are possible. It might be argued that lines 121-128 do not properly belong to the poem at all, since they are so similar to lines in no. 6; rejecting them on this basis we would have no reference to Sir Lachlann’s son, and little dating evidence.

Again, the deaths of Eachann Bacach’s brothers are traditionally held (see Introduction, Section 2) to have occurred at the Battle of Inverkeithing in 1651. Since they were evidently dead when this poem was composed (lines 121-122), we might hold that the poem was composed after that battle: not long after it, since lines 124-126 would then have to be understood, like lines 423-427 (see Notes on no. 6), to indicate that Eachann Bacach knew that Eachann Ruadh had been wounded in the battle, but did not yet know that he had died. But we have, as far as I know, no means of being sure that the tradition referred to was not based on the present poem, with a false identification of the àrach of line 122 with Inverkeithing. As far as we know, the battle here referred to could just as well be one of those which occurred during Montrose’s campaigns of 1644–1645.


99-100. The HM text is: O nach taol mi noil,/’S gur hi bheoil sho chlachc mi. A gloss on noil by Maclean Sinclair in the manuscript says: “n Aodhail, the name of a brook or place.” Another says: “Faodhail, a ford.—”.

I have failed to identify any place to which Fadhail here could refer, and the HM text in any case seems to demand the o-vowel. Entries in McDonald, Gaelic Words, s.vv. fothail and meadhail, suggest that the meanings of (f)othail and meodhail may have been very similar (cf. note on line 846).

[TD 165]

I have treated seo here as a mere relative particle (see note on line 488), since as a demonstrative it has no likely referent.

105-106. Perhaps line 105 is part of the same sentence as the previous two lines; but here it is taken as a parallel to line 101, which also begins a sentence.

If the red tops of the houses are the result of fire, as seems certain, this might well have been caused by Leslie’s army after its departure from Mull after garrisoning Duart: they are said to have caused some destruction after leaving Mull (see note on line 209).

By Earra-ghàidheal (arighael in HM) the poet presumably means the mainland adjacent to Mull.

107-108. Cf. lines 472-473.

110. HIM has neo ratanach tais. The long -à- is demanded by the rhyme with nàmhad. I have understood ràtanach as an adjective derived from a form of ràdh like ràitinn, used in lines 704 and 1365: perhaps we should read neo-ràitinneach.

Tais, with its basic meaning “damp, moist”, is usually a complimentary epithet only in regard to physical beauty, and in regard to fighting is usually unfavourable (“timid”, “soft”, “faint-hearted”, Dwelly; cf. RIA Contribb.). The meaning “calm” in the translation is a guess based on Dwelly’s meaning “relaxed”.

111. HM has im bragade. Bragàda is here understood as plural (cf. musgacha in line 115), and im as representing the possessive pronoun, 3rd person plural: the literal meaning is thus “their brigades”, “they” being Sir Lachlann’s followers in battle.

116. HM appears to have swì, and opposite the line in the manuscript Maclean Sinclair has written “smur orr’ gun teabach” (this last word is a little unclear): above smur he has written suidh. The word seems to be sùith, “soot”.

117. HM has Don ghramhalt thoilor. We might expect the plural here and, unless we take it that this couplet is out of place and ought to be placed after st. 8, the singular gràbhailte is presumably to be taken as standing for the helmets of all the Macleans.

119-120. This couplet, presumably addressed to the Macleans in general, probably refers to the same incident referred to in lines 450-459 (see notes on these lines). On the other hand, it is possible that the reference is to the distant mythical ancestors of the Macleans, the sons of Míl, who conquered Ireland (Clan Gillean, pp. 29-30; and see note on line 1166 here).

[TD 166]

121-122. The apparent cold-heartedness of the poet in dismissing the deaths of his brothers as relatively unimportant would seem to be, to some extent, a literary device which was fairly widely used in the 17th century—though we have, of course, no reason to doubt that Eachann Bacach had, in fact, lost his brothers in a battle.

Iain Lom similarly dismisses the death of his father in a poem composed in the 1640s (Mackenzie ed., lines 95-96, and see note, p. 235). Anndra Mac an Easbuig dismisses the death of his wife as less important than the loss of his brothers (lines 850-851). The same device occurs in a poem (which has been thought to be the work of Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh, see TGSI XLI, p. 18) in E, p. 233, lamenting the death of Eachann Ruadh in 1651; and in another in An Gaidheal LVIII, p. 3.

A somewhat milder use of the same device, without reference to the poet’s kin, may be seen in lines 434-435, 460-463 and 517-518: it looks as if Eachann Bacach was fond of this device, which may be an extension of that which James Ross (Éigse VIII, p. 13) calls “emphatic antithesis”, used here, e.g., in lines 136-140.

125-126. On the change from the third person (line 125) to the second (line 126) see note on line 425: the change here is unusually abrupt, and JM (see Sources and Readings) reads e for thu.

128. This line might be taken as an argument against the date and circumstances of the composition of the poem as postulated above. I have seen no evidence that Eachann Ruadh had taken part in any battles before 1647.


4. A’ CHNÒ SHAMHNA

This poem is edited from four sources: HM, MN MS 52, ML MS 222A and E, p. 85. The text followed here is that of HM, but stt. 6 and 11 are supplied from ML, and stt. 16 and 19 from E (see Sources and Readings).

The title A’ Chnò Shamhna appears in HM as well as in the versions in GB, p. 45, BL, p. 37, and BG, p. 205. Mackinnon (Catalogue, p. 319) seems to imply that the same title is used in a MacNicol manuscript, but I have failed to find it anywhere in MN. The title, which seems rather inapt, is clearly taken from line 147. Titles of this kind seem to be rare in the poetry of this period, and we might expect a title like Marbhrann do Shir Lachlann (as in SO, p. 77) or like those in ML and E (see Sources

[TD 167]

and Readings). But since HM may be our oldest source for the poem, and since the text here is mainly based on it, we must clearly keep HM’s title. Perhaps the scribe saw line 147, with its implication of the imminence of Sir Lachlann’s death, as being of central importance in the poem.

There is some disagreement about the date of Sir Lachlann’s death. “Seneachie” on p. 153 gives the date as April 18th, 1649, yet on p. 226 he says that Sir Lachlann died in 1648; The Clan Gillean (p. 252) gives 1648. J. P. Maclean (History of Clan MacLean, p. 176) resolves the conflict in “Seneachie’s” dating by saying that Sir Lachlann died on April 18th, 1648 (cf. BL, p. 34). The 1716 account given by Macfarlane (Genealogical Collections I, p. 136) is likewise uncertain and gives both 1648 and 1649 as possible dates. A late-18th-century account in Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 246, gives the year as 1649. Samuel Johnson states (Chapman ed., p. 120): “In 1649, Maclean of Dronart in Mull married his sister Fingala to Maclean of Coll …”. “Maclean of Dronart” can only be Sir Lachlann (see Clan Gillean, p. 252), but perhaps we cannot put much reliance on Johnson’s dating. In May, 1649, the Synod of Argyll urged that its followers should have no dealings with Sir Lachlann (Mactavish, Minutes 1639–1651, p. 134). If Sir Lachlann had died in 1648 the Synod could scarcely have been unaware of it, and we may thus conclude that he died in 1649. It remains possible that April 18th, 1649, was, as “Seneachie” says, the date of his death, and that the Synod had not yet heard of it in May—but even this seems unlikely.

The poem can therefore be dated to 1649, and line 197 seems to confirm this date (see note below).

In MN and in the original text of ML (see Sources and Readings) the poem is ascribed to Pàl Crùbach, presumably the MacLeod poet who composed Iorram na Truaighe on the death in 1649 of Iain Mór, 14th MacLeod of Dunvegan (BG, p. 201). We have, however, no good reason to reject the ascription to Eachann Bacach in HM and in the revised version in ML: lines 193-194 show that the author was closely connected with his subject. It is likely that the ascription to Pàl Crùbach is due to an error based on the virtual equivalence of some of the meanings of bacach and crùbach.

On August 7th, 1809, Miss Margaret Clephane (on whom see also no. 1, Notes) sent Sir Walter Scott “a translation of the words of the Gaelic coronach of Sir Lauchlan Maclean (the hero

[TD 168]

of the war song [i.e. no. 1 here]) which has become so popular as to be the coronach of the clan” (Grierson, Letters 1808–1811, p. 226 n.); the translation may have been dictated by her mother, Mrs Marianne Maclean Clephane (ibid., p. 229). In a postscript to his reply, dated 17 August 1809, Scott says: “The Coronach of Maclean is one of the most beautiful specimens of Celtic poetry I have ever seen. I would attempt to gratify you by putting it into English Metre, but I distrust my own powers of combining the same degree of strength and simplicity” (ibid., p. 230).

Scott published an “imitation, or free translation” (SO, p. 77) of part of the present poem (stt. 1, 2 and 4) in his The Lady of the Lake in 1810, in a note on the word coronach, which appeared in his text (Lang edition, p. 209). The note begins as follows:

The Coronach of the Highlanders, like the Ululatus of the Romans, and the Ululoo of the Irish, was a wild expression of lamentation, poured forth by the mourners over the body of a departed friend. When the words of it were articulate, they expressed the praises of the deceased, and the loss the clan would sustain by his death. The following is a lamentation of this kind, literally translated from the Gaelic, to some of the ideas of which the text stands indebted. The tune is so popular, that it has since become the war-march, or gathering of the clan.

Coronach on Sir Lauchlan, Chief of Maclean

‘Which of all the Senachies
Can trace thy line from the root, up to Paradise,
But Macvuirih, the son of Fergus?
No sooner had thine ancient stately tree
Taken firm root in Albion,
Than one of thy forefathers fell at Harlaw.—
’Twas then we lost a chief of deathless name.

‘’Tis no base weed—no planted tree,
Nor a seedling of last Autumn;
Nor a sapling planted at Beltain;
Wide, wide around were spread its lofty branches—
But the topmost bough is lowly laid!
Though hast forsaken us before Sawaine.

‘Thy dwelling is the winter house;—
Loud, sad, sad, and mighty is thy death-song!
Oh! courteous champion of Montrose!

[TD 169]

Oh! stately warrior of the Celtic Isles!
Thou shalt buckle thy harness on no more!’

Cf. J. P. Maclean, History of Clan MacLean, p. 420. Scott’s words “literally translated” should perhaps not be taken too literally. The poem has nothing to do with the tradition of mourning-songs (on which see Collinson, Traditional and National Music, pp. 113 ff.).

As Scott says, part of this poem is also used in the text of The Lady of the Lake itself. In a section headed “Boat Song”, addressed to a MacGregor chief by his followers, the following lines occur (Lang edition, p. 44):

Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain,
Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade …
(cf. lines 136-138; BG, p. 318)

Simon Fraser, in his 1816 collection (no. 76) provides a tune for this “Boat Song” (see note on p. 110 there), which was intended, says Scott (Lang edition, p. 197), as “an imitation of the jorrams, or boat-songs, of the Highlanders”.

Margaret Clephane, who provided Scott with a translation of this poem, was married in 1815 to Spencer Joshua Alwyne Compton, who became Marquis of Nothampton. She contributed two poems to Alexander Campbell’s Albyn’s Anthology, vol. II, published in 1818 (see p. 61 n.). She died in 1830, and her mother and sisters survived her (Grierson, Letters 1831–1832, p. 498; Clan Gillean, p. 462).

CW MS 204 contains class notes by W. J. Watson on the BG version of the poem, and these are quoted occasionally below. The poem is discussed, and much of it translated into English, in Thomson’s Introduction, pp. 128 ff.


129. The possessive pronoun is ar or air in all sources. But since these often appear in the same sources for bhur, I have taken the form here as bhur (as BG and Scott’s translation have) because of the parallel use of the second person (th’ainme) in line 135.

For Phàro HM has Phàraish, ML and MN MS 18 (Mackechnie, Catalogue I) have Pharrais, and E emends to Phàra. Clearly therefore, the form intended in the oldest sources was Phàr(r)ais, and the translation “Paradise” is given by Scott (above) and “heaven” by Mackinnon (Catalogue, p. 319). Such forms must

[TD 170]

be wrong, however, because the preceding gu would not lenite the P- of Pàrras (cf. Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, line 961, and Celtica IX, p. 330). However the form Phàrais is to be explained, the Ph- is clearly the radical, not the lenited, form and the reference must be to Pharaoh. Eachann Bacach obviously knew the tradition, expanded on by Maighstir Seathan (see note on line 1166), that the Gaels were descended from Pharaoh.

The word Phàro here rhymes with words like seanchas, Fearghas, Albainn: in st. 15 the words càradh and Flànras rhyme with earba and tearmad. Stt. 6 and 14 contain other examples of this type of rhyme, and many more are to be found. John Macdonald has discussed this type of rhyme in SGS II, p. 73, but seems to stress rather too heavily that “a word in a rhyming or assonating position which contains a svarabhakti vowel requires a word with similar vowel to make rhyme”. It is clearly acceptable in the 17th century and later (cf. Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs II, p. 257 n.) that a long à should rhyme with a short a when the latter is followed by a consonant group broken by an epenthetic vowel. It is thus unnecessary, I suggest, to use the form Pharao, as in BG, especially since HM and E mark the first a long.

A similar rule applied to other vowels in rhyme: for e see lines 40-41, 178-179, 258; for o see lines 16, 26, 141, 194, 243; for u see lines 319 (and note), 842, 961 (and note).

131. Ach appears only in HM, though it may also have been in the version translated by Scott (above). ML reads “Tha Mac Mhuirich Mhic Fhearghuis”, which is similar to Scott’s line but must nevertheless be wrong, since the Mac Mhuirich family (on whom see Thomson, TGSI XLIII, pp. 276 ff.) are not known to have descended from any Fearghas.

There is nothing in the text to give the “and” of the translation, but it is only by understanding it that I can make sense of the line.

The first reference is probably to Cathal Mac Mhuirich, well known as official poet to Clanranald: he is on record in 1629 and was still composing poetry in 1661 (TGSI XLIII, p. 298). Possibly it was he who praised the Macleans in a poem, part of which appears in Macfarlane’s Genealogical Collections I, p. 142 (interpreted in SGS IX, pp. 90-91). The writer there says (p. 119): “Mac Varich Shenachie to the Family of Clan Ranald in a Panegyrick upon the Macleans affirms their being originally related to Curi Mac Dari …”. In her letter in MS 73.2.26, Mrs

[TD 171]

Christina Mac Kenzie lists the oldest poems she has, and ends with “a fragment of a panegyric of Mac mhurichs upon the MacLeans, at what period the last was composed I cannot say, but it been look’d upon as a very old one”.

The name Mac Fhearghais is glossed in ML: “Last Clark Register of I Columke an Antiquary”; in MN MS 18 (Mackechnie, Catalogue I, p. 332) “Clerk-Register of Icolmkill”, and in E “Clerk-Register of Icolumkill”. This may reflect a tradition which is also mentioned, only to be partly rejected, in a letter of March 30th, 1786, from the Rev. James Johnstone in Copenhagen (Pinkerton, Correspondence vol. I, pp. 118-119): “To suppose that the Caledonian records were preserved at Iona is a common error … It is much more likely that Kenneth the 2nd, after obtaining the Pictish crown, intrusted his archives to Tuathal M’Fergus, primate of the united kingdoms; but who resided in a part of the nation very remote from Icolmkill, and much less explored.” It seems unlikely that Eachann Bacach would treat of any such early figure in the same terms as “Mac Mhuirich”.

Watson (BG, p. 318) draws attention to a document of 1485 (Macdonald, Clan Donald II, pp. 746-747), involving the Lord of the Isles and witnessed by “Lacclannus mc muredhaich archipoeta” (TGSI XLIII, p. 286) and “Colinus Fergusii, domini cancellarius”: the latter may have been known as Mac Fhearghais. In 1559 a Master Neill McAris was the notary public who drew up a bond of friendship between Norman MacLeod of Harris, the Earl of Argyll and Eachann Mór, 11th of Duart (Macleod, Book of Dunvegan I, p. 44). The 1786 letter quoted above from Pinkerton’s Correspondence (for the reference to which I am indebted to Dr J. W. M. Bannerman) goes on to say (p. 120): “I am told a Baron Ferguson, in Cowal, is possessed of some charters which nobody can read. I wish they could be copied: they are most certainly of the Norwegian princes.” Dr Bannerman suggests to me that, if these charters really existed, they are quite likely to have been in Gaelic script. On Ferguson families in Cowal see Fergusson, Records, vol. I, pp. 236-237; vol. II, pp. 67-69. However, apart from these three isolated references I have found nothing to suggest that Mac Fhearghais or Ferguson was the surname of any family of learned men comparable to the Mac Mhuirich family.

Matheson has suggested (TGSI XXXIX/XL, p. 227) that the “Mac Fhearghais” referred to here may have been the

[TD 172]

official historian to Maclean of Duart, and Professor Thomson suggests to me that he may have been a member of the Beaton family, in which the name Fearghas was not uncommon. There are several instances of the name in the “Genealogy” published by Mackinnon, and various branches of the Beaton family trace their ancestry back to one Fearghas Fionn (p. 142; cf. Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 285; TGSG V, pp. 98-99). It is therefore possible that the style “Mac Fhearghais” was used by the Beaton (Mac Bheatha) family, or part of it, which was attached to the Macleans of Duart as physicians. In support of this suggestion, Mr Ronald Black has directed my attention to O’Grady’s description of a medical manuscript in the British Museum (Catalogue I, p. 223). The manuscript is said to date from the 16th century, and the following note, in a hand said to be of the 17th century, appears in it: “Mac: ffargus is the true possesor of this booke”. O’Grady comments: “one of the Betouns no doubt”.

It is thus quite likely that the reference in the poem is to John Beaton (1594-1657), representative of this learned family when the poem was composed (his father’s name, Dr Bannerman tells me, was Malcolm). This John was probably the last hereditary physician of his family, but the family were scholars as well as physicians, and John could have served the Macleans in both functions (see Scottish Studies 12, pp. 62-63). Maighstir Seathan says of this family (Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 33): “Our Physicians were Beatons both in Mull and Ilay, of whose skill and acts they talk great things. They were expert schollars both in Irish and Latine, but had English ne’er a word …” John Beaton’s second son was succeeded by Maighstir Seathan in 1702 as minister of Kilninian and was well known as a seanchaidh (see Introduction, Section 6).

However, there still remain other possibilities for identifying the “Mac Fhearghais” here referred to. Ronald Black draws my attention to a reference in “The Genealogy of the Macras” written by the Rev. John MacRa (d. 1704), brother of Donnchadh nam Pìos, printed in Macphail, Highland Papers I, pp. 198-199: “A more particular account might be had from such as conversed with and have known those historians and genealogists, such as Fergus MacRourie, Mildonich MacLean, etc., who were good scholars and acquainted with the manuscripts and records of Ireland … and from them I heard it confidently said and affirmed, that the Mackenzies, MacLeans and MacRas were of the same people in Ireland.” Mr Black (who informs me that

[TD 173]

Mildonich MacLean is Maol Domhnaigh Ó Muirgheasáin, d. c. 1662, cf. SGS XII, p. 195) suggests the possibility that Fergus MacRourie was the father of the individual referred to here.

132. The word ré is re in the sources, and BG is followed here in adding the mark of length. Re could equally well represent the preposition ri (as it often does in HM), and the ML reading, re h Aimsir, might support this interpretation. But in any case the meanings “during” or “for (a time)” which ri has are probably at least partly due to the influence of the noun ré, “a space of time”.

The translation here is based on Thomson’s (Introduction, p. 129) in understanding ré as “a long period” and aimsir as a genitive form.

134. Eachann Ruadh nan Cath (? c. 1367–1411), 6th chief of the Macleans, acted as Chamberlain to his uncle, Donald, second Lord of the Isles. The Battle of Harlaw, near Inverurie in the Garioch (Gairbheach), Aberdeenshire, was fought on July 24th, 1411, between Donald, claiming the Earldom of Ross, and Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Eachann Ruadh was in command of Donald’s right wing, which defeated Mar’s left, but was mortally wounded in a fight with Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum (Clan Gillean, pp. 53-55). The battle is referred to in the Annals of Connacht (Freeman ed., p. 410.15) in the following terms: “Maidm mor le Mac Domnaill na hAlpan for Gallaib Alpan, 7 Mac Gilla Eoin do muintir Meic Domnaill do marbad hi frithguin in madma-sin” (translated by Freeman: “Mac Domnaill of Scotland won a great victory over the Galls of Scotland. Mac Gilla Eoin, one of Mac Domnaill’s followers, was killed in the resistance of the vanquished”). This accords well with Highland tradition, but historians are by no means certain as to the outcome of the battle (see Carney and Greene, Celtic Studies, pp. 147, 167 n. 2).

The placename appears as cairrbha in HM, cairrbheach in E; the Red Book of Clanranald (RC II, p. 160 n. 3) has cairfech.

Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn, in a poem in the same metre, has the line (BG, line 3632): “Chuidich Eachann cath Gairbheach”.

136. Cuire is taken here as an alternative for cuir, genitive of cur, which can mean “planting”. Watson (CW MS 204) gives: “craobh-chuir, a sapling; lit. a tree that has grown from seed” (cf. BG, p. 356). Eleanor Knott (Tadhg Dall II, p. 189) has noted several instances of cuir used attributively of trees in Classical Gaelic, but its exact meaning has not been established

[TD 174]

(see RIA Contribb., C, col. 472.62 ff.). There are instances of its use with craobh, which, however, means “branch” in Classical Gaelic. But the word may also be used of things other than trees and plants, so that the identity of this cuir with cur, “planting”, is very doubtful. However, cuire in the present instance may represent a usage quite different from that of Classical Gaelic cuir, since the context suggests strongly that craobh chuire means “recently-planted tree”.

Plannta presumably denotes a very young plant here, a sense the English word plant can also have.

138. Perhaps we should read chuireadh, for HM has chuirtheadh; the line is omitted in MN and ML. The translation is based on the assumption that Maytide is the usual time for sowing and planting (see Meek, Campbell Collection, nos. 53, 435).

140. On the meaning of seo see note on line 488.

143. After this line MN and ML insert another: “’S glan an t-iubhar a dh’fhàg mi.” This is ignored in the text here because it is not in HM, but in any case it seems a little out of place, especially with its singular personal pronoun.

145. HM has clari, while other sources have clàran. Similarly, a poem by Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn in JM (p. 323) has the line “Sdu leba chumhaing na clàri” (cf. BL, p. 63, line 24). Clàraidh may be a plural similar to Irish plurals in -(a)í, which probably derive from Classical Gaelic plurals in -(e)adha. Compare also the plural mnài for bean (as in line 874 here), and see note on line 150 below.

147. MN, ML and E begin this stanza with line 148, which MN and ML follow with line 150, placing this line third in the stanza.

In CW MS 204, Watson’s notes on this line are as follows: “cnò shamhna, ref. to the custom of cracking (and eating) nuts at Halloween. Also nuts were placed in the fire in pairs to represent a lad and a lass. If they burned quietly side by side, good; if one or both sprang aside, not good.” This has no obvious direct bearing on the line in question, which is perhaps why Watson has no comment on the line in BG. The HSD similarly defines Cnò-shamhna: “The hallow-even nut, nuts eaten or burnt on hallow-eve in divination of marriage”.

A possible explanation of the line, perhaps the one favoured by Scott (above), is that Sir Lachlann lived almost until Oidhche Shamhna, but not quite, and that he therefore died in October,

[TD 175]

1649. The poem An Crònan Muileach contains the following lines in Gillies’ Collection, p. 33:

<gai>
Lach’uinn a dh’fhalb mu Fheill-iain
Mo sheachd ruin chuaidh dhuibh mu shamhuinn
’S ceann mo mhuirn ann cunthart fadhasd.
<eng>

Matheson (TGSI XLI, p. 21), arguing that this poem is the work of Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh, suggests that instead of Lach’uinn here we read Eachann, which is the name in the version in Campbell’s Albyn’s Anthology II, p. 61. The first line above might then be understood to refer to the death of Sir Eachann of Duart at Inverkeithing on July 20th, 1651: Féill Iain is probably June 24th, but it is given as an approximate date. The second line could refer to Sir Lachlann’s death “mu shamhuinn” in 1649.

This explanation, however, is certainly not beyond question, and perhaps Watson’s notes are nearer to the mark. Mr Donald E. Meek tells me that his father, a native of Tiree, knows of a custom there whereby, on Halloween night, hazelnuts were heated and then people tried to crack them between the palms of their hands (cf. Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs, 215.7). If a man failed to crack a nut in this way it was believed that he would die before the next Halloween. It is possible, then, that Eachann Bacach knew of such a custom in the Mull of his time, and is in effect saying here: “Your life was fated to be cut short”.

148. Taigh geamhraidh occurs also, again in reference to death, in a poem of which there are two versions in the CW MSS (see Mackechnie, Catalogue I, pp. 501, 502, MSS 152.xxviii, 158).

150. Ranntaibh in HM is altered in E to ranntaidh. These are understood here as plurals of Dwelly’s rann, which can mean “genealogy, pedigree, ancestry, relationship, bond, tie”. The revised ML version reads Ranncachd. Cf. note on line 195 below.

151. HM has Nach clisg, and the emendation here offered by E is accepted in the present text; MN and ML have “Cha do theich”, and there is an emendment in ML to “Cha do chlisg”. The implication may be that Sir Lachlann’s death was due directly to his bravery, but I have failed to discover how exactly he died. But see note on line 209 below.

152. After the victory of the army of James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, at the Battle of Tibbermore on September 1st, 1644, Lachlann of Duart was anxious to lead his men to join Montrose, but was prevented from doing so by fear of his

[TD 176]

Campbell neighbours. Montrose spent the winter of 1644 plundering Campbell lands, and Lachlann brought a handful of men to join him at Cille Chuimein (Fort Augustus) at the end of January, 1645. He “was received by the marquis with much cordiality, and publicly thanked for the promptitude with which he answered the summons. His followers immediately had parts allotted to them about Montrose’s own person, and were to continue in such positions until the levies from Mull and Morvern arrived” (J. P. Maclean, History of Clan MacLean, pp. 165-167). Iain Lom believed (Mackenzie ed., lines 259-261) that the presence of the full Maclean force would have prevented any of the Covenanters escaping from the Battle of Inverlochy, which was fought on February 2nd, 1645, with Sir Lachlann and his few followers in the centre of Montrose’s victorious army.

After the Battle of Alford (July 2nd, 1645) Sir Lachlann led 1100 men, 750 of them Macleans, to join Montrose, and when they left Mull the Campbells ravaged it. The Macleans took part in the victory of Kilsyth on August 15th, 1645, and left Montrose’s army early in September.

155. Watson (CW MS 204): “dol a sìos: the regular term for charging in battle. The Gaelic soldiers always tried to charge from higher ground.”

158. On caist’ see note on line 75.

160. It would be easier to change leò to leat, following the revised ML text, but the leo of HM is at least defensible, even if it makes the grammar somewhat complicated. The sgapaodh of HM is Scappa in MN and Scapaidh in ML and E.

161. This stanza occurs only in ML, though it is virtually certain that it was also present in MN MS 18 (see Sources and Readings).

162. Thigeadh is an emendation of the ML text, which has “A thig”. Pistil is the ML form, and is also the form in HM for line 402 (where ML MS 227 has piostol).

166. Instead of this line, the text of ML, as originally written, gives lines 172-173. But in the margin the line given here has been written as a replacement for both these lines. The first word of the emendation is unclear in the manuscript: it could be Ar, perhaps, or even (English ?) Or.

The word pàis, with the alternative form péis, is known in the dialect of Bernera, Lewis, Mr Donald MacAulay informs me, in a sense akin to that of the word pax as used in English, a “truce” or “respite”.

[TD 177]

168. The reference here seems to be to the medieval English tradition of the gauntlet as a challenge—a notion which seems to be rare otherwise in Gaelic. The use of the word fuasgladh seems to imply that the gauntlet belongs to the person taking up the challenge, and this does not accord with the usual English tradition.

169. Gach, omitted in HM, is clearly demanded by the context and the metre and is inserted here from E.

170. Watson (BG, p. 376) quotes a similar line from Turner’s Collection, p. 230, in a poem by the 18th-century Maclean poet Iain Mac Theàrlaich, and concludes that mac a’ mhàil means “rent-payer”. If this is correct, the form mac a’ mhàile (Mhàili in Turner) may have the extra syllable simply to fit the metre (cf. chuire in line 136 above). Iain Mac Theàrlaich may well have been borrowing consciously from Eachann Bacach. Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 877, and cf. line 2052) also praises a chief for his leniency in the collecting of rent. See Matheson, MacCodrum, pp. 267-268.

The form in the revised ML text is Mhic a Mhaille, and a footnote says: “Mac a Mhaille discharged all ugly un-soldier like men from his house”. The writer evidently believed that some popular tradition was being alluded to here.

173. Pòr could be the English word pore (as in BG, line 2801): “when pride entered into your pores” (Thomson, Introduction, p. 130). It is taken here as the word for “seed” used, like sìol, for a group of people related to one another.

174. Watson (CW MS 204): “aithriseach, worthy of recounting”.

175. HM has two slightly divergent versions of this stanza, in the first of which na crannan is written and in the second na n crannan. Crannan is probably a derivative of crann and not a plural form of it: the plural of crannan appears as crannanan in line 571. Though the context of line 571 suggests that the meaning is connected with the pipes, the verb bualadh is used with the noun, as beumadh is used here. Here too the words séideadh (line 176) and perhaps seirm (line 178) suggest that crannan is a name for the pipes, or some part of the pipes; cf. also note on line 666. In BG, p. 319, Watson refers us to Dinneen’s crann ciuil: a bassoon, drone of bagpipe, a flute. The meaning “drone of bagpipe”, however, does not seem to be very well attested (see RIA Contribb., C, col. 509).

If verbs for “striking” like beumadh and bualadh were used in

[TD 178]

relation to such a piping term (cf. “striking up a tune” in English), it is not surprising that crannan, after falling out of use, should be thought to mean “drum”: it is so glossed in E, p. 298, and in the revised ML version of the present line the word Crannain is glossed “Drums”. Watson’s note in CW MS 204 is: “crannan, here prob. spearshafts”; but in BG he favours the meaning “drums” and notes that, apart from this instance and that in line 571, “there appears to be no other reference to drums in Gaelic poetry”. There is, however, such a reference in line 394, and another in Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, line 1687.

The use of the genitive plural here and in the following line (nan crannan, nan deannal) before an infinitive form may seem somewhat archaistic, but this usage was not uncommon in the Classical prose of the 17th century (e.g. O’Rahilly, Desiderius, lines 262, 269, 270-272).

176. HM’s second version of this stanza has sheisdadh instead of shéideadh. Thus we might read here: “Thun nan deannal a shéisdeadh” (? to block the assaults).

178. Seirm, “music”, probably has some reference to the crannanan of line 175; air seirm is attested by Dwelly for “in tune”. But the connection with crannanan is probably intended to be much more vague than the translation implies, and some of the secondary meanings of seirm (“skill, dexterity” according to Dwelly) may also have been in the poet’s mind.

180. I have found no parallel for the expression used in this line. Watson says (CW MS 204): “Luan-chasga, Easter Monday—a day of rejoicing”, apparently implying that Luan Càsga here means simply “day of rejoicing”, just as càisg can, according to Dwelly, mean simply “feast”.

183. Compare the lines composed by Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh in 1646 (Watson, Mary Macleod, lines 233-234; BG, p. 319):

<gai>
Mar ghàir sheillean am bruaich
An déidh na meala thoirt uath.
<eng>

The following lines by Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn appear in BL, p. 190, from JM:

<gai>
’S ann a tha do luchd-muinntir’
Mar ghaoir sheillean ga t’ ionndrainn.
<eng>

There is a much later use of the same idea in Sinton’s Poetry of Badenoch, p. 255:

[TD 179]

<gai>
Mar sgaoth sheillean ’am bruachaig
’Caoidh na meal’ thugadh uap’ as an sgip.
<eng>

A very similar couplet appears on p. 288 of the same work.

Dr J. L. Campbell has sent me the following note on lines 183-184: “The force of the comparison to bees deprived of their honey is more apparent when one realizes that, under the old straw skep system, taking the honey meant also depriving the bees of their homes and ultimately, if not immediately, of their lives.” (A description of the process of smoking the bees to death, probably with dried fungus in the Highlands, may be found in the 1797 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica.) “Bees which had been absent from the hive when this smoking was done (probably late in August) would have found on their return home and honey gone, and would have circled the spot buzzing angrily, along with any survivors of the process.”

188. In the Lowland Scots of the 15th and 16th centuries the crounar was “a district officer charged with maintaining certain rights of the crown; a coroner” (Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue). Perhaps when borrowed as Gaelic crùnair the meaning was even more vague, so that the word here may be simply a vague compliment; but there may be a reference to some official function Sir Lachlann had.

189. Perhaps “Ghabh a rathad …” (“has taken his road”), exactly as in HM where, however, a often appears for an. E has an here.

193-194. On seal mun see note on line 1221. On the possible implication of these lines see Introduction, Section 2. The grammar of line 194 may be compared with that of the Biblical line (1 Tim. iii.5): Oir mur aithne do dhuine a thigh féin a riaghladh, “for if a man know not how to rule his own house”.

195. This stanza occurs only in MN and ML which, it is suggested in the Sources and Readings section, are closely related, ML probably being derived from MN. ML, however, is followed here because of the material it contains in addition to that derived from MN: I have no reason to think that this additional material does not belong to the poem.

One such addition is line 195, which appears only in the revised ML version. Perhaps it should be excluded (cf. Metres and Tunes), for it could have been taken over from another poem. Iain Lom, in a poem dated post 1663, has the line: “Tha do ranntaichean farsainn” (Mackenzie ed., line 1256, and cf. line

[TD 180]

1262), and Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh in 1699 says (Watson ed., lines 671-672):

<gai>
Is ar ranntanan farsaing
Nan rachte ’nam feum sud.
<eng>

Here ranganan, for “ranks” in battle, may denote potential allies.

197. King Charles I, on whose behalf Montrose’s campaign had been waged, had given himself up to the Scottish army in England after his defeat by the parliamentarians in 1646. He was handed over to the English Parliament on January 28th, 1647, and imprisoned. He was executed in London on January 30th, 1649 (Mackie, Short History, pp. 174-175), and this line may confirm that the poem was composed after that date.

201. Perhaps we should read glasadh here for MN’s glassidh: MN not infrequently represents -adh by -idh. But ML has read glassaidh. Compare line 160, where sgapadh, in a similar context, is from the sgapaodh of HM.

202. This stanza appears in HM in a very imperfect form, and I have filled the gaps from the revised ML version.

James Ogilvy (1586–1666), 7th Lord Ogilvy, became first Earl of Airlie on April 2nd, 1639, after having joined the Royalist forces. He was a cousin of Montrose, both their mothers being daughters of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie (Paul, Scots Peerage I, 122; VI, 241). Airlie’s son, also James (1611–ante 1704), 8th Lord Ogilvy, was also a Royalist, and the destruction of their house by the Earl of Argyll in 1640 gave rise to the well-known song The Bonnie Hoose o Airlie, and perhaps also partly to Montrose’s conversion to the Royalist cause. By October, 1644, the 8th Lord Ogilvy was in prison in Edinburgh under sentence of death, but Airlie and two other sons, Sir Thomas and Sir David, joined Montrose, and Sir Thomas was mortally wounded at the Battle of Inverlochy. Airlie’s part in the Battle of Kilsyth is said to have been important in ensuring a Royalist victory there, and as a result the prisoners in Edinburgh, including Lord Ogilvy, were set free. Ogilvy and Airlie were both in Montrose’s force defeated at Philiphaugh on September 13th, 1645; Airlie escaped, but Ogilvy was imprisoned in St Andrews and again sentenced to death. He is said to have escaped by dressing in his sister’s clothes on the morning on which he was to be executed (Fraser, The Land of the Ogilvys, pp. 90-105; Spalding, Memorialls II, pp. 404-445).

[TD 181]

203. This line occurs only in ML, HM having left the line blank after the first letter C-; possibly the scribe understood “Iarl Ogilvy ’s Airlie” (line 202) as denoting a single person—this would make nonsense of the line, which was therefore not written.

The translation is doubtful. Note the expression recorded in Achill, Co. Mayo (Stockman, Irish of Achill, p. 77, no. 726): tugadh ciall chogair dhó, “he was given sense of a whisper i.e. a whispered warning that the purchase he was about to make was useless.”

204. For some other uses of the English word faction in Gaelic see SGS IV, p. 73; RIA Contribb. s.v. facsoin; and Appendix IV here.

205. For o’n Éinne HM has on Nainachd and ML on Fheinne. The name must be that now spelt Enzie, the district in northern Banffshire from which the Gordons of Huntly obtained one of their titles, Earl of Enzie. In BG, line 2555, a later Marquis of Huntly is called Marcus na h-Éinne. The reference here is therefore to George Gordon, 2nd Marquis of Huntly, who had vacillated somewhat in his support for the Royalist cause, but was executed in Edinburgh on March 22nd, 1649 (Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, pp. 242-243, 252-254). Lord Ogilvy, Montrose and Huntly had met each other at Aberdeen and at Keltie in 1643 (Spalding, Memorialls II, pp. 252-253), and perhaps Ogilvy had a part in ensuring that Huntly eventually joined the Royalist side, as these lines suggest.

206. This line occurs only in HM, where it reads: ’S ann nad thaich is a ghearadh. Interpretation of the last word in this is especially open to question, but the line is the only one which gives the stanza any direct relevance in the poem. If the line implies a meeting at Sir Lachlann’s house in winter, I have no other evidence for such a meeting. It can hardly have occurred in the winter of 1644-1645, since at that time Ogilvy was in jail (see note on line 202 above), and in any case both Ogilvy and Airlie were committed Royalists before 1640 (Fraser, Land of the Ogilvys, p. 90). It is possible that the following tradition (Morrison, Manuscript, pp. 65-66), which opens a tale set in the late 16th century, is of relevance here: “It was the custom of all the Chiefs and proprietors within the Isles to meet at Castle Duart, the seat of the MacLeans in Mull, for the purpose of settling any differences that had arisen between them and to regulate their conduct as to how they were to assist each other in

[TD 182]

case of invasion or molestation from strangers or foreign enemies” (cf. Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 45).

208. Perhaps we should follow ML here in reading “do Rìgh Sheurlas”. The significance of HM’s distinction between aig and do here is not clear to me.

209. The reference is to Lieutenant-General David Leslie who led the Covenanting forces at Philiphaugh. He followed up his victory there by marching north to subdue the Marquis of Huntly, and in May, 1647, led an army to Kintyre, Islay, Jura and Mull. Mr Ronald Black tells me that Leslie’s report on his activities in Mull, now among the Parliamentary Papers in the Scottish Record Office, PA11, is dated July 24th, 1647, so that these activities must have been completed by that date. In July, Sir Lachlann was forced to surrender to Leslie his castles of Duart and Aros, and Duart was garrisoned by Leslie’s men (Turner, Memoirs, pp. 48-49; Clan Gillean, pp. 181-191). It is possible that this is why Eachann Bacach says in line 150 that Lachlann’s kinsmen suffered as a result of his fearlessness in opposing the Covenanting armies during Montrose’s campaigns.

It may have been after leaving Mull that Leslie destroyed Gylin Castle in Kerrera (TGSI XLVII, p. 289), and we next find him in “Knoggard or Moggart, I know not which” (Turner, Memoirs, p. 49).

211. HM omits the t, but inserts the apostrophe before fhear. The t was therefore probably omitted by a slip of the pen, and is inserted here from ML which, strangely enough, omits the word fhear, presumably by a slip of another pen.

212-213. Alasdair Mac Colla Chiotaich, Montrose’s principal lieutenant, evaded Leslie’s pursuit in Kintyre and Islay and went to Ireland about the end of May, 1647. The insurrection begun there in 1641 (with Alasdair playing an important part) was still going on, with a struggle between the “Confederate Catholics” and English parliamentary forces. Alasdair quickly became Lieutenant-General in the Confederate army, and at the Battle of Cnoc na nDos in Co. Cork on November 13th, 1647, he was second-in-command to Theobald, Lord Taaffe. The Confederates were defeated by Murchadh Ó Briain, Murchadh na dtóiteán, Lord Inchiquin, and Alasdair was killed (Hill, MacDonnells of Antrim, pp. 113 ff.). For details of this battle, “the biggest battle ever to take place in Munster”, see O’Brien, Munster at War, pp. 141 ff.

216. The principal enemy of Montrose, Alasdair Mac Colla

[TD 183]

and Sir Lachlann, at Inverlochy and after, was Gilleasbuig Caoch (1598-1661), 1st Marquis of Argyll.

219. The forms for chubhaidh in the sources are chuibh (HM, E) and Chuïdh (ML); perhaps the rhyming pattern also strengthens the case for chubhaidh. The meaning, however, “that the rough ground was not suitable for you”, raises difficulties in the context: BG has emended the word to chuing (“yoke”, “hindrance”), and BL to chuith (“a snow-bank”). But chubhaidh might be understood, with the remainder of the stanza, to imply that the subject’s bowmanship was so good that he had no need to struggle over rough ground in order to get a good shot at his quarry.

222-223. Cf. Macleod, Sar Orain, p. 79.

227. Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 1195) speaks of fiùdhaidh chinn stòraich, “the barbed arrow”.

228-229. Cf. Watson, Mary Macleod, lines 268-269; Mackechnie, Dewar Manuscripts, p. 311, n. 224.

231. Feòlach is defined in dictionaries as “carnage, slaughter”, and the Old Irish feólbach as “flesh of slaughtered animals, flesh-meat” (RIA Contribb.). Eachann Bacach seems to be extending the meaning to “quarry” (potential flesh-meat).

E is the only source which reads tearmad, the others having dearmad. The latter, which scarcely makes sense here, could well be due to mishearings of an original tearmad (preceded by an).

233. Dìol freasdail is explained in BG (p. 319) as: “liberality of entertainment”, literally “satisfaction of ministration”.

235-236. Feadan here is the “worm” of a whisky-still (cf. BG, p. 365). Watson notes that the same line occurs in a poem of c. 1722 by Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn (Turner’s Collection, p. 16; BL, p. 201). Note also the following lines from Sinton, Poetry of Badenoch, p. 249:

<gai>
Uisge-beatha nam feadan
Air a leigeadh tri uairean.
<eng>

237. Rev. W. Matheson tells me that a family known as Clann Mhic Néill na Caillich served the Macleans of Duart as harpers. This information he obtained from Mull tradition, but see also Logan, Scottish Gael II, p. 268; J. P. Maclean, Clan MacLean, p. 289. In a rental of 1662 we are told that Phanmoir (said to have been known as Fàn Mór nan Clàrsairean), which is about two miles south-east of Torloisk, was “possest be the harper”

[TD 184]

(information from Mr Eric Cregeen), and the same statement is made in a rental of 1674 (Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 280).

241. Màthadh is understood here, following BG, p. 377, as a verbal noun, “trumping”. Mr Cathair Ó Dochartaigh tells me that this may well be the earliest attested occurrence of any form of this word in Gaelic. It may be unknown in modern Scotland, but mádh, “trump”, is widely used in Ireland. Mr Ó Dochartaigh suggests that Dinneen may be right in deriving the word from the name of an old card-game, spelt in English mawe. An earlier (?) use of toirm, “calling at cards” (BG, p. 392), may be found in JM, p. 152 (GB, p. 22, line 27; Gaidheal I, p. 179): “Sdu gu m’ buinnedh a chinsh air a torm”.

244-245. It is assumed here that cnaip (translated “cubes”) denotes the dice, two of which were used in backgammon (cf. Matheson, Blind Harper, p. 139).

Tàileasg is the modern form of the word which appears in Middle Irish as táibles, táiplis or táiplesc, a borrowing from medieval French or English tables. These words originally denoted a board-game known in Latin as tabula, which can be traced back to the first century A.D. in Europe. During the 15th century the English name tables came to denote any board-game, including chess, and perhaps the Gaelic tàileasg likewise became less specific: Martin Martin uses the word tables in this general sense about 1700 (Matheson, loc. cit). About the 15th century, earlier games called tables began to be ousted by chess, ultimately an import from India, as the most popular board-game in English-speaking Britain, but in the 17th century there was a revival in Europe of a form of tables called gammon in Lowland Scots and backgammon in English. This game was thus probably included in the blanket term tàileasg, which could also denote the board, but perhaps not a specific game played on it (Bell, Board and Table Games, p. 57; Celtica III, p. 270; RIA Contribb., s.v. táiplis).

Backgammon is notably different from chess in that it uses dice and in that money is wagered on it. Such games were certainly played in the Highlands, as the works of Martin Martin, the Blind Harper and Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines 170-172) show, and it is a fair bet that Eachann Bacach is here referring to a similar game.

247-248. Mention of beautiful women (often, but not always, engaged in sewing or singing or similar seemly pursuits) is common in 17th-century poetry in accounts of the evening

[TD 185]

entertainment in a chief’s house. For other examples see line 39 here; Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, lines 162, 509, 1710-1711, and p. 291, st. 6; Matheson, Blind Harper, line 871; CC, pp. 225-226; Sinton, Poetry of Badenoch, p. 279, 2nd stanza; Knott, Tadhg Dall, no. 11, st. 16.

The word pasmann appears as pasmun in HM and as pasmainn in ML: in the latter it is glossed “flommry, embroidery”. The word is clearly a borrowing from Lowland Scots passment, which is attested as pasmant in the early 16th century and is related to French passement. The SND defines passment as: “Stripes of gold or silver lace or silk braid used as decorative trimming; livery”. It usually appears in the plural, and therefore the pasmun of HM may represent a Gaelic genitive plural, while the ML form is probably genitive singular.

In a poem composed by Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn in 1725 or later we have the lines (BL, p. 210):

<gai>
Siod’ is pasmunn air do dhornaibh,
Mar a chàireadh taillear doigh orr …
<eng>

Here and in line 39, in Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, line 509, and in Knott, Tadhg Dall I, p. 75, line 64, cur (cor) seems to denote the process of “doing” embroidery, or other similar ornamentation, whether this be translated “sewing” or not. Keating, writing in the 17th century (Foras Feasa III, line 2770), has cur síoda ná gréis, in which his editor, Dinneen, translates cur as “wearing” (cf. RIA Contribb., C, col. 470).

249. Watson (CW MS 204): “pòit, feasting—not ‘drunken’. the manner of their entertainment.”

250-255. St. 19 occurs only in the revised ML version and in E. In ML only the first four lines are as here, and there are three others:

<gai>
’S mnathain rimhich cuir pasmainn
’S gunta sid’ or mar fhasan
Gus ’m bu sgith leo gu cadal tra noin.
<eng>

This clearly belongs to st. 18, so st. 19 is given here from E.

259. Sir Lachlann’s wife was Mary, daughter of Ruaidhri Mór, MacLeod of Dunvegan (Clan Gillean, p. 252).

262. HM reads na n eireadh, but I cannot understand this, and have substituted mun on the authority of MN, ML and E. The implication may be that it was the practice in Duart to have the Scriptures read during meals. Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines

[TD 186]

1855-1858) praises Sir Donald of Sleat for reading the Bible, but only “when he became weary of music-makers”.

264. Stt. 21-22 are on the analogy of a ship, though this is never made explicit, and we must take it that e here refers to the ship, i.e. the Maclean inheritance. MN and ML have i instead, perhaps with the word long in mind.

266-268. The terms ceann slaite, fear beairt and taod sgòid are explained in the vocabulary to BG. In Thomson’s Introduction, p. 132, the verb dìobair is taken to mean “abandon, desert” rather than “expel, depose”, and I see no way of deciding which meaning the poet intended.

274. Dwelly’s meaning for fear-iùil is “pilot”, but I have followed Thomson (loc. cit.) in translating it as “helmsman”, since the pilot’s function seems to be allotted to the Holy Spirit in line 275.

275. HM has Naomh ga, and the adjective is here changed to Naomha to fit the metre. MN and ML, however, insert the infinitive bhith after Naomh.

On the words nòs, “dock”, see Éigse VI, p. 66.


5. ÒRAN DO LACHANN

This poem is taken from E, p. 89, where it is entitled: “ORAN do Lach’unn mor Mac Gilleòin triath Dhubhairt, le Eachunn bachdach.” It is printed from E in SO, p. 79 (which omits st. 11), and BL, p. 29.

I think there is good reason to question the identification made in E’s title both of the subject and of the author.

Lachlann Mór, 13th chief of Duart, was perhaps born in 1557, and died at the Battle of Tràigh Ghruinneard in Islay in 1598 (Clan Gillean, p. 149). This would probably make it impossible that any poem addressed to him when he was young (as lines 276 and 284 indicate) could have been composed by Eachann Bacach, whose datable works place him in the mid-17th century.

The identification of the true subject of the poem would seem to depend, to some extent, on the interpretation of lines 292-295. As they are interpreted here, lines 292-293 refer to the subject, the chief of the Macleans, in the third person, and lines 294-295 switch to the second person, addressing him directly; such a change of person is quite common in 17th-century poetry (see note on line 425). The subject is therefore a chief of the Macleans named Lachlann, and (taking it that the only error in E’s title is

[TD 187]

the use of the word mór) we may conclude that the subject is likely to be Sir Lachlann, the 16th chief, the subject also of nos. 1, 2 and 4. In 1623 Sir Lachlann was called “of Morvern” and acted as a surety for the appearance of Ruaidhri Mór MacLeod of Dunvegan before the Privy Council (Clan Gillean, p. 178): both of these facts would indicate that he must have been aged at least 21 in 1623, so that he cannot have been born much later than c. 1600. A poem to him while he was still young cannot therefore be dated very much later than the 1630s. If the poem was composed in Mull, as seems likely because of the numerous Mull place-names, its subject must, from the evidence of lines 278, 302-303, 368-369, have been absent from Mull for a considerable time when it was composed.

On the other hand, a more obvious translation for lines 292-295 might be: “The chief of the Macleans has grown splendid through bravery: he has spread the word over every lordship that you have maintained your honour properly”. In this case, the subject of the poem cannot be any Maclean chief, and we have no means of identifying him. The editor of E may have interpreted the poem in this way, and seen the conflict between these lines and his title, for he has a footnote to the words Chlann Ghill-Eathain: “i.e. Chlannghilleinoin”. The rhyme, however, shows that Chlann Ghill-Eathain is correct.

If we follow this interpretation, however, and assume that E is correct in saying that the poem is addressed to someone called Lachlann Mór, we can find a reasonably good candidate in Sir Lachlann Mór Mackinnon. He was born about 1628, became effective leader of his family in 1649 and died about 1690 (Mackinnon, Clan Fingon, pp. 30-35). His father was Iain Balbhan (or Balbh), who, although deaf and dumb, was chief from about 1629 till about 1641, when he died in his castle in Mull (ibid., p. 30; Celtic Review IV, p. 38; cf. PCR, 2nd series, III, p. 322; IV, p. 677).

Before the 15th century the Mackinnons had been a Mull family, but they obtained the lands of Strath in Skye about 1400, and this eventually became their principal estate. In 1515 and 1517 their chief was Niall Mackinnon of Mishnish, which is in Mull, but by the middle of the 16th century the chief was Eòghann of Strathswordale in Skye. From about this time there was an unbroken tradition of friendship between the Mackinnons and the Macleans (Clan Fingon, pp. 18-19; cf. BL, p. 122). At the time of the death of Iain Balbhan about 1641, the family still

[TD 188]

held the castle of Dunara in Mishnish, and one of the sons of Lachlann Mór was called Iain “of Mishinish” (Clan Fingon, pp. 30, 36; cf. Scottish Historical Review LVI, p. 37).

Sir Lachlann Mór’s mother was Catherine, daughter of Lachlann Maclean, 7th of Coll (Clan Gillean, p. 372), and his own first wife was Mary, daughter of Sir Lachlann of Duart (ibid., p. 252). From 1642 till 1649 Lachlann Mór’s tutor-dative, since he was a minor, was Iain Garbh, 8th Maclean of Coll (Celtic Review IV, p. 38).

All this would help to explain the poem’s emphasis on its subject’s potential allies in Mull, if the subject is, in fact, Sir Lachlann Mór Mackinnon. While we have not the slightest direct evidence for this, and while there are probably others who might equally well be considered as possibilities, this identification would at least be consistent with the fact that the poet (presumably composing in Mull) is shown by lines 287 and 364 to be addressing someone who is across the sea. Following this identification we would have to date the poem, which calls its subject Lachann òg, to a time not long after 1649, or perhaps even before that date. Such a date is, of course, consistent with composition by Eachann Bacach.

We thus have considered two chiefs called Lachlann who might be the subject of the poem, and there may well be others, but we must, I think, favour Sir Lachlann of Duart, if only because his name fits more closely the title given in E, which is the only primary source for the poem. Other points of evidence which may seem to favour either Sir Lachlann will appear in the notes which follow.

Since the title in E is in error on some points, it is possible that it is in error also in its ascription of authorship. The metre of the poem (in as far as we can identify it, see Metres and Tunes) seems out of keeping with the metres of the other six poems by Eachann Bacach given here, and indeed with the metres of most other encomiastic poems of the mid-17th century. If the title in E is entirely unreliable we have no dating evidence for the poem, and the comparatively jaunty metre might suggest that the date is a good deal later than c. 1650. This makes the identification of the subject as Sir Lachlann of Duart (with its consequent dating of c. 1630) especially questionable, and would seem to rule out Lachlann Mór of Duart (d. 1598) entirely.

Accepting, nevertheless, that the poem may have been composed either c. 1630 or c. 1650, we have in line 283 a piece of

[TD 189]

evidence against Eachann Bacach’s authorship. While the mention of a kiss there could be held to represent an old literary convention (see note below), the simplest explanation is that the poet was a woman: possibly lines 368-371 also point, rather less clearly, in the same direction. In SGS XIII p. 105, the suggestion is made, without much evidence, that the proper heading for this poem may be Òran do Lachlann òg Mac Fhionghain, leis an Aigeannaich Nighean Domhnaill Ghuirm, a heading which occurs in ML MS 76 without any poem to follow it. We must note, however, that line 283, with its strong hint of female authorship, occurs in the chorus, and that choruses can be moved from song to song. But in this case the chorus begins with the same address to Lachlann òg which begins the first stanza, so that this chorus is likely to have originated with this poem.

Lines 278 and 303 could be taken to imply that the poet has only met the subject once, a considerable time ago, and does not expect to see him again for up to a year. This, together with the limited acquaintance with the subject implied in lines 300-303, suggests that the poet was not professionally employed by the subject, whereas it is likely (see Introduction, Section 2) that Eachann Bacach was maintained as a poet by Sir Lachlann.

Whether the poet was Eachann Bacach or some unidentified woman, lines 338-339 carry a suggestion that the poet was especially well acquainted with the people of Bràigh Chàrnaig, which is near Duart (see below).

Since I cannot give the poem even an approximate date, its position as no. 5 here has been decided arbitrarily.


277. I can make no sense of this line, which appears in E exactly as given here. Mar probably means “unless”, because it has this meaning in line 279. Following glacadh in line 279, we might read tréigeadh here. Judging by the rhyme-system of the poem (see Metres and Tunes), the word bòrd may be wrong and may have replaced a word rhyming with faic in line 276. Professor Thomson suggests to me that such a word might be Dwelly’s baic (cf. Dinneen baic, doubtless a form of bac), given as an obsolete word meaning “twist, turn”; possibly it is used here for a “turn of fate”, so that we might read Mur tréigeadh baic no bàs mi, “unless a turn of fate, or death, were to leave me abandoned”.

BL substitutes a quite different line: “B’ e m’ aiteas a bhith lamh-riut”.

[TD 190]

279. Fiabhras àrd looks like a translation of English “high fever”. Its appearance here might argue against the mid-17th-century dates suggested above for the poem. On the other hand, it is possible that the editor of E has made an emendation here.

280-281. These lines are printed as one in E: A ghnùis sholta ’s am bèul o’n sochdrach gàire. There are thus only seven lines in the chorus in E, in which this chorus is given both at the beginning and at the end of the poem. While it is perhaps possible that the chorus was composed in that unusual metrical form, it is more likely that half a line has been lost in transmission to E. SO copies the seven-line chorus from E, and BL patches up the faulty line:

<gai>
A ghnuis chiuin, mhàlda, sholta,
Is am beul o ’n socrach gàire.
<eng>

283. As suggested above, this line seems to indicate that the poem was composed by a woman, unless we are to decide that the chorus did not originally belong to the poem. It remains possible, however, that the entire poem was composed by a man, and that we have, in the notion of the subject kissing the poet, a remnant of a conceit popular among the professional poets (filidhean) of earlier Gaelic tradition, whereby the poet views himself as, in some sense, his master’s lover. Carney, in his Irish Bardic Poet (pp. 12-13, 37-38; cf. Carney and Greene, Celtic Studies, pp. 25 f.), noting this idea in the works of Eochaidh Ó hEoghusa (c. 1568–1612), traces it back to the 7th century and argues that it is of pre-Christian origin. There is an echo of this in line 418 here, and another in a praise-poem (HM, p. 15) by Iain Mac Ailein to Donald MacLeod of Talisker (d. 1733), where he calls him “An Domhnall sin ’s leannan dhomh” (BL, p. 129, line 34). It could perhaps be argued that there is another such echo in Iain Lom’s poetry (Mackenzie ed., lines 1924-1927), where the poet speaks of preparing his patron’s bed (cf. Carney, Irish Bardic Poet, p. 37).

290. As is pointed out above, neither Lachlann Mór, 13th of Duart, nor Sir Lachlann, 16th, was a son of Iain, but possibly the words da rìreadh imply that Iain garg was not, as a matter of genealogical fact, the subject’s father.

If the subject is either Lachlann Maclean, we may conceivably have here a reference right back to the Iain (Eòin) Dubh who is said in The Clan Gillean, p. 44, to have been the 4th chief of the Macleans, and who is on record in 1326 (Exchequer Rolls, vol. I,

[TD 191]

pp. lxxiii, 57); but nothing seems to be known about him to explain the epithet garg.

SO changes ghairg to Ghairbh. Accepting this, and taking the subject of the poem to be either Maclean chief, we might interpret the line as a reference to Iain Garbh, first Maclean of Coll, who lived in the 15th century and was a brother of Lachlann Òg, 8th of Duart: he was thus not an ancestor of the Duart family (cf. Clan Gillean, p. 367), but he is traditionally remembered for his warlike exploits (ibid.; MacLeoid, Sgialachdan, p. 125). If the subject here is Lachlann Mór Mackinnon, however, the emendation of SO would presumably indicate a reference to Iain Garbh, 8th Maclean of Coll, who was for seven years tutor dative to Lachlann Mór (see above).

Again, taking the subject to be Lachlann Mackinnon, “Iain garg” might be his father, Iain Balbhan or Balbh, but although he is said to have been “a man of extraordinary bodily strength” (Lamont, Strath, p. 71), I have seen nothing to indicate that he might have earned the epithet garg. However, the use of such an adjective might be purely formulaic, and the poet might have had much more information about Iain Balbhan than we have today. We might even consider substituting Bhailbh here for ghairg.

BL avoids the difficulty here by changing mac Jain ghairg (E) to macan garg.

305. Lùb is taken here as vocative of a feminine noun which, according to the HSD, can have the meaning “a young man”: Eachann Ruadh of Duart, who died in 1651, is referred to as lùb ùr in a poem in BL, p. 26 (line 15); cf. also BG, p. 375.

309. Pìcein is a diminutive of pìc, English pike, which is frequently used in 17th-century poetry for a bow, e.g. lines 79, 220 and 584 here, and see BG, pp. 380-381.

On the significance of the word dathte see note on line 76.

310. To draw the arrow back to the ear has been shown to be “the proper method for accurate aiming” (University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, vol. XIII, 1917–1923, p. 392). Cf. BG, line 5425; Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, line 126.

311. Beith is the usual form in dictionaries, which mark it feminine, but the masculine form beithe is old (RIA Contribb.), and there is a South Uist instance of it in beithe dubh, “a kind of wood” (McDonald, Gaelic Words, p. 40). Beith is marked by the HSD and Maceachen as occurring both as masculine and as feminine. The form beithe was recorded by Borgstrøm in Barra

[TD 192]

(Dialect of Barra, p. 144) and by Holmer in Skye and the Argyllshire islands (Argyllshire Gaelic, p. 127) and in Arran (Gaelic of Arran, p. 15), and Edward Lhuyd (c. 1700) recorded “Bêhe” in Argyllshire (Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 118, no. 14). Beithe is also attested in Carm. Gad. VI, p. 13.

A modern bowmaker, A. E. Hodgkin (Archer’s Craft, p. 109), says: “For hunting-arrows, for durability, and for accessibility, only two materials are worth our attention. These are white birch and Japanese bamboo.” It is likely that Japanese bamboo (Arundinaria japonica) would not have rated highly for accessibility in the 17th-century Highlands, and we may perhaps deduce that the best arrows at that time were made of white or silver birch (Betula alba or verrucosa), which was formerly represented in the Highlands by much better specimens than are now to be found there (Hadfield, British Trees, p. 177).

Birch arrows are also alluded to in a poem in Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, p. 411, line 95.

312. Wax (céir) on the tail of the arrow is also referred to in the work of Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Watson ed., line 264), Pàl Crùbach (BG, line 5427) and Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 129), and in an anonymous early-17th-century poem in BG (line 6341); note also the verse quoted in Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, p. 236, n. 124.

315. The translation is based on Dwelly’s entry: fuil bhrùite, “extravasted blood”. A poem, probably of the 17th century, in Gillies’ Collection, p. 300, has the lines:

<gai>
Mu’n do chuir iad t fhuil bhruite

318. Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh’s line Air crios nam ball snìomhaineach is translated by Watson (line 1064) as “on a spiral-embossed belt”.

Guns made in Scotland are distinguished, as late as the 18th century, for the use of traditional “Celtic” forms of decoration (Jackson and Whitelaw, European Hand Firearms, p. 57). A 1686 example of such a gun, with “running leaf-scrolls and grotesque animals”, may be seen in Drummond, Ancient Scottish Weapons, Plate XXIX; Jackson and Whitelaw, Appendix, Plate I.

319. Taking a as the masculine possessive pronoun, referring to cuilbheir in line 318, the syntax here is rather complicated and unusual. Perhaps we should emend to ’S a’ bhéil, following BL, which has ’S a bheoil.

[TD 193]

Cuimse, rhyming with fhùdair, chliùitich and lùth-chleas, looks like an instance of a short vowel, when followed by an epenthetic vowel, rhyming with the corresponding long vowel (see note on line 129). However, cuimse rhymes with the place-name Cuimhnis in a Mull poem in JM2, p. 226, BL, p. 58, and Macalpine gives the pronunciation of cuimse (and aimsir) without the epenthetic vowel. On the other hand, an epenthetic vowel occurs in Glengarry (Dieckhoff) and in part, at least, of Skye in the derivative word cuimseach (Borgstrøm, Skye and Ross-shire, p. 33); cf. also the South Uist form cuimis (Mac Gill-Fhinnein, Gàidhlig Uidhist a Deas, p. 116).

324-331. These lines presumably refer to some event in the subject’s life, and if the reference could be found we would probably be able to identify with certainty the subject of the poem.

329. Dwelly says that pais can mean “slap, blow with the open hand” or “box on the ear”. He gives SO as his source for the latter meaning, probably referring to the present use of it (SO, p. 79).

334. Here E has:

<gai>
Eadar rutha chuitheirnis,
Gu dubhairt thun a gorbh-leat.
<eng>

I can make nothing of this as it stands, and have felt bound to add the ’S in line 335. Even with this the gu may seem out of place after eadar, but Mr Donald MacAulay tells me that modern Lewis Gaelic would not be at all uncomfortable with a phrase like “Eadar Steòrnabhagh is a null gus na Lochan”.

Rubha Chuitheirnis seems likely to represent Quinish Point at the north end of Mull, where Maclean of Coll held lands (see Scottish Historical Review LVI, p. 37), but this is not certain, for I have seen no other indication of an r in the original name of Quinish. In a poem of c. 1672 (JM2, p. 226; see note on line 319 above) the name appears as Cuimhnis (rhyming with chuimse). It is, however, possible that Cuitheirnis represents an old alternative form, derived from Norse kvíar, “cattle-folds”, instead of the singular kví, from which Cuimhnis is derived (Nicolaisen, Place-names, p. 97; cf. SGS X, p. 85). On the other hand, perhaps Rubha Chuitheirnis was the name of some other place and has been forgotten: Mr Duncan MacQuarrie, Tobermory, tells me that he knows of no Gaelic name for Java Point, near Craignure (cf. Tocher 24, p. 292).

[TD 194]

I have understood from the emended text that the area referred to is that which lies between Rubha Chuitheirnis and the southern extremity of the Duart lands at the Garbh-leud. This is doubtless the steep hillside named Garbh Leathad on Ordnance Survey maps, rising from the south bank of the river Lussa about two miles west of the point where the Lussa reaches Loch Spelve, and some six miles south-west of Duart. Mr MacQuarrie tells me that the lower Lussa is traditionally known in Mull to have been part of the boundary between the estates of Duart and Lochbuie. Leud is a form of leathad, “breadth”, which frequently occurs in the names of slopes or hills (cf. Hogan, Onomasticon, pp. 484-485).

336. E has a h aird ghabhar-shlios, which looks suspiciously like an Anglicism (Ardgour-side); SO changes -shlios to leat. Ardgour was, and is, part of the Maclean lands.

339. Càrnaig was in the parish of Torosay (Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 284) in the south-east corner of Mull, the parish which also included Duart, but I cannot locate it any more closely.

342. In the context of allies from various parts of Mull, Mòir-innis (moir-innis in E) seems virtually certain to represent Mornish, the north-western part of Mull: the rhyme-system, however, shows that the trisyllabic form is likely to be correct (see Metres and Tunes). Watson (Dwelly, p. 1023) gives the Gaelic form of Morenish as Mór’nis and, if this is the same place, seems to confirm that the second element of the name is innis.

This line appears in BL (1898) as “Is thigeadh ort a Mor-innis”. Counnduillie Morison must have queried this form in a letter to Maclean Sinclair, for, in a letter dated May 9th, 1898, Maclean Sinclair tells Morison: “I used Mor-innis because I did not feel sure what it meant, and because Mor-innis was the word used by Ranald Macdonald in his collection in 1776. But I am disposed to agree with you that the place really meant is Mòirnis in Mull. I had some idea that the reference was to Skye, as a mor innis, whence the Macleods would come. The line could be made to suit by writing, ’S bu shunndach tigh’nn a Moirnis ort, or ’S le fonn thigeadh a Moirnis ort.”

343. Leòghant’ (E) should perhaps rather be translated something like “with a lion device”, since it is used here in relation to a flag. While the most constant elements in Maclean coats of arms seem to be a ship and a hand holding a cross, a lion rampant appears on the arms of the families of Lochbuie,

[TD 195]

Ardgour and Pennycross (J. P. MacLean, History of Clan MacLean, pp. 342-345). It is therefore possible that the allies from Mornish (?; see previous note) might have carried a banner with a lion as part of its design.

348. The reference is presumably to the Macleans of Lochbuie, whose principal seat was at Moy (Moie) Castle, at the head of Loch Buidhe. The spelling of the place-name here is taken from E (mhuaithe), and I have no evidence on which to base any emendation. J. P. MacLean (History of Mull I, p. 111) gives the name as “Caisteal nan Maoidh,—castle of threatening”, but this seems fanciful. In other poetry of the period the genitive of the name of this castle appears as na Maighe (e.g. BL, p. 149, st. 7; p. 181, line 7; p. 202, line 31): the form Moidhe in JM2, p. 228, probably represents the same sound. The word underlying the place-name may therefore be magh, “plain”, which can be feminine (Watson, Celtic Place-names, pp. 500-501). It is to be noted that Dwelly (p. 1023, sub Moyley) believed that magh had a locative form muaigh.

354-355. E has A dheanadh luatha chaisleacha for line 354, and the emendation here is taken from BL. A more justifiable emendation might be “A dhèanadh luath a chaisleachadh”, but I cannot find any way of reconciling “shaking up ashes” with the firing of guns.

In the text as emended the reference may be to the fact that lead bullets were carried by musketeers in pouches (Hayward, European Firearms, p. 23): each time a bullet was fired the gun had to be reloaded, and a good musketeer would presumably shake up his pouch to get another bullet for loading as soon as his previous shot had been fired.

Teanchair is defined by Dwelly as “pincers, tongs”, “smith’s vice or tongs”, its Old Irish equivalent tenchor being defined in the RIA Contribb. as “tongs, pincers, forceps”. The translation here suggests that the word was applied (in this case at least) to the small “dog-head” or cock (in effect a vice) which forms part of the lock in guns of the wheel-lock (a 16th-century invention) and later types. This cock held a piece of iron pyrites which, when the trigger was pulled, produced a shower of sparks by friction against a revolving steel wheel. The sparks ignited the gunpowder in the flash-pan and the resulting flash fired the bullet (Hayward, p. 24).

359. Armadh, which I have not seen elsewhere, is here taken as an equivalent of armachd, a noun derived from arm. However,

[TD 196]

perhaps we should emend to armaibh, dative plural of arm; this would give the same meaning.

365. The syntax of the word air is very unclear, and may be based on some colloquial usage which is not strictly grammatical, if, as seems likely, air refers to Lachann.

367. This line is a conjectural emendation of E’s Leis ’m ba chleachdach cùirtmhoir. BL emends this to Is d’an robh ’n cleachdadh cuirteil.


6. ÒRAN DO SHIR EACHANN

This poem is edited from N, HM, ML MS 227, E, p. 178, and JM: both E and JM derive mainly from HM, but each is also a primary source for one stanza. The text followed here is that of HM, which lacks stt. 6 and 12: these are supplied here from N.

The following lines occur at the end of N:

<gai>
Co nfoghnadh leo tfogra gu fód ghlnne falach
gun do thúr bailte móra bheith gun choir aig mac cailain
stfuil chraobhach ga dórtadh arran dóidin gun scaphal
<eng>

These lines clearly belong to Iain Lom’s Cumha Morair Hunndaidh (1649), see Mackenzie ed., lines 571-574, 577-578.

After the defeat of King Charles I at Naseby in 1645, and the defeat of Montrose at Philiphaugh in the same year, the king threw himself on the mercy of the Scottish Covenanting army in 1646, while the Covenanters began to distrust more and more the intentions of the English parliament. But Charles refused to establish Presbyterianism in England and was handed over to the English parliament. Even then many Scottish leaders were willing to fight for the king against the English parliament, if the king would give Presbyterianism a three-year trial in England, and a treaty to this effect, called the Engagement, was signed in 1647. The leader of those who opposed the Engagement, holding out for the permanent establishment of Presbyterianism in England, was Gilleasbuig Caoch, 1st Marquis of Argyll, and he and Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the English parliamentarians, were successful in defeating the Engagers. In January, 1649, the English beheaded the king. His son Charles commissioned Montrose to return and invade Scotland, but Montrose was defeated at Carbisdale in Ross-shire in April, 1650, and hanged in Edinburgh in May.

[TD 197]

Charles II agreed to accept the Scots’ conditions for making him king: he undertook to observe the Solemn League and Covenant of 1639 and the National Covenant of 1642, and he arrived in Scotland in midsummer, 1650. Cromwell crossed the border and defeated the Scottish army under David Leslie at Dunbar on 3rd September, 1650. There was no Highland contingent in Leslie’s army at Dunbar, nor had there been any since the defeat of Philiphaugh, but after Charles was crowned king at Scone on 1st January, 1651, the Macleans and others felt able to join the Scottish army.

Leslie kept the army at Stirling to bar Cromwell’s way northward. Cromwell sent his army across the Forth at South Queensferry, and Leslie sent a force of some 3,500 men from Stirling to oppose them, under the leadership of Major-General James Holburne of Menstrie (d. 1687). Holburne’s force was met at Inverkeithing on Sunday, 20th July, 1651, by about 4,000 of Cromwell’s men under Major-General John Lambert. The battle lasted for four hours, and it seems that Holburne, with about 1,000 cavalry, fled shortly after it began.

There were some 800 Highlanders in Holburne’s army, 700 of them Macleans led by Eachann Ruadh nan Cath, the 17th chief. In spite of great losses inflicted by Lambert’s artillery, the army fought on after Holburne’s flight, and the Macleans and Buchanans actually advanced against the English till they were surrounded and destroyed, and Eachann Ruadh was killed. Only 40 of the Macleans are said (“Seneachie”, p. 165) to have survived (Mackie, Short History, ch. 19; Menzies, Scottish Nation, ch. 8; Douglas, Cromwell’s Scotch Campaigns, ch. VII; Stephen, History of Inverkeithing, pp. 359-366).

The story is well known of how Eachann Ruadh got into difficulties in the battle, and was saved by one of his men who stood between him and his enemies and was killed. Then seven more men in turn defended him in the same way, each shouting as he leapt between Eachann and the enemy: “Fear eile air son Eachainn!” Sir Walter Scott includes this tale as an episode, attached to his fictitious hero Hector or Eachin, in his novel The Fair Maid of Perth, first published in 1828 (see 1903 edition, vol. II, pp. 339-348).

Eachann Ruadh is said to have been about 27 years old at the battle (Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I, p. 137), and is traditionally supposed to have had “a charm which made him invulnerable in battle, though it failed him at the disastrous

[TD 198]

battle of Inverkeithing” (J. P. Maclean, History of Mull I, p.167).

Maclean Sinclair (Clan Gillean, pp. 195-196) offers the following appraisal of Eachann Ruadh’s part in the battle: “Sir Hector Roy was an accomplished chief, a born fighter, and a valiant man. His fiery nature, however, unfitted him for being a successful commander. His conduct in continuing the unequal fight at Inverkeithing so long, when he might have retreated or surrendered, was utterly unreasonable. It was useless to his king, and injurious to his clan. His own life and the lives of his loyal followers were too valuable to have them thrown away to accomplish an impossibility. While, then, we admire Sir Hector’s bravery and determination, we deplore his recklessness and folly.”

Clearly this poem was composed when the poet had heard of the outcome of the battle and of Holburne’s flight (lines 375-379, 388-391, 411) and had heard that Sir Eachann had been wounded (lines 424-427, 499), but had not yet heard that he had died: lines 435, 462-463, 484-486 and 508 show that the poet is uncertain, anxious and not optimistic about the fate of his chief. Although some lines (475, 500-501, 504-507), taken alone, could be understood as implying his death, there is no clear statement that he is dead. Furthermore, much of the poem (stt. 3-5, 8-10, 12) consists of encomiastic episodes of a kind common in the praise of living subjects, and the tone of the remainder is one of anxiety rather than mourning.

How Eachann Bacach could have heard so much about the battle, without knowing of the death of his chief, is hard to understand in the light of present knowledge concerning the battle. In line 374 he appears to be telling us that (for whatever reason) his information is incomplete. It is possible that Eachann Ruadh, though mortally wounded at the battle, did not die till some time later; or possibly Eachann Bacach had heard about some wound he had received earlier in the battle, before the wound which killed him.

Eachann Bacach received his information on a Sunday (line 373). This must surely be the day on which the battle was fought, for by the following Sunday he would certainly know of the death of Eachann Ruadh. We do not know, of course, where Eachann Bacach was on the day of the battle (despite the tradition given in the Introduction, Section 2, that he actually took part in it), though we might assume (cf. line 425) that he was in Mull. In any case it would not be surprising that any news he

[TD 199]

received about the battle on the day on which it was fought would be faulty.

We may therefore surmise that the poem was composed in the few days following July 20th, 1651.


373. ML reads “Fhuair mi gle mhoch Dia-domhnuich”, but this must be wrong if, as suggested above, the news referred to in line 372 was received on the day of the battle. The battle began early on the Sunday morning (Douglas, Cromwell’s Scotch Campaigns, p. 279).

Compare the opening of a mock elegy by Murdoch Matheson on Walter Ross (d. 1721) in TGSI XLV, p. 173:

<gai>
A dhuine ’s truagh leam an sgeula
ris na dh’éisd mi an ceartuair.
<eng>

The line “A ri gur h-oil leam a sgeula” also begins a poem in the Macleoid collection (1811), p. 161.

374. This form of the line appears only in HM. The translation is obtained by taking sgeul in line 372 as feminine: Dwelly attests it as feminine in Badenoch, and Mr Donald MacAulay tells me that it is also feminine in Bernera, Lewis. The line in N and ML would suggest “Cha robh agam ri fhoighneachd”. E alters ga foighneachd to da shenechus, probably without good reason: this does not form the required aicill with fhoill-sa in line 375.

375. All the other sources have rinn where HM has chath.
I
Iain Mac Ailein and Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn also speak of the treachery of Holburne:

<gai>Foill Hòburn ’s nam marcach ’thug cùis diu.<eng> (BL, p. 104, line 3)

<gai>Ghabh Hobrun foill air do bhuidhinn.<eng> (BL, p. 211, line 21)

376-387. “Seneachie”, writing his Historical Account in 1838, says (p. 161): “as a song, familiar to the generality of Macleans, expresses it:—‘Dhág e dêodh Mhachdghilleain cuir a chàthà na ónhreachd.’ (He left the undaunted son of Gillean alone to fight the foe.)”

Professor Thomson points out to me that the meaning of the word shìos in line 376 may be “on the battlefield”, just as dol sìos means “going into battle” (see note on line 155).

N gives lines 378-379 before lines 376-377. ML gives these lines as here, but directs that the order be reversed, as in N, so that the stanza ends with lines 376-377. Since HM has no

[TD 200]

chorus, the chorus here is taken from ML (see Metres and Tunes), and the last two lines of the ML chorus are the same as the last two lines of st. 1 there, i.e. lines 376-377 here. Since the chorus is given only once in ML it is impossible to be sure, but it is assumed here that the chorus following each stanza was intended to end with the last two lines of the stanza: I have therefore used lines 378-379 as the end of the first chorus.

378. The roibh of HM might represent throimh rather than roimh.

391. The word given here as luingis could perhaps be luinges in the manuscript (HM), which is not clear; N has luingeas. The reference may be to the fleet of about 60 “double shallops” which ferried Cromwell’s men across the Forth on the day before the battle (Douglas, Cromwell’s Campaigns, p. 278). If the poet is implying the arrival of Cromwellian reinforcements after the battle had begun, I have seen no evidence to support him.

392. For HM’s geall sin, E has geallsinn, perhaps viewing the word as a form of gealltainn.

393. Dwelly exemplifies na h-uiread with the phrase na h-u. cheannais oirnne, “so much superiority over us”; in the Bible we find “ciod iad so am measg na h-uiread?” (John vi. 9); see also Ériu XIII, p. 179, n. 2. The literal meaning of the line here may be: “Had there been but so many [of Lambert’s men]”; and the implication may be “as many men as Eachann Ruadh had”. Compare line 788.

394. HM has baing. This I take to be for bang, “drum”, which gives a better aicill with champa, and which is otherwise attested only, as far as I know, in Macalpine’s dictionary, which is based on the Gaelic of Islay; Macalpine also gives an alternative form banga. E alters the word here to baingan.

396. Metal helmets were used in 17th-century Highland armies, at least among the leaders. A description of such an army in 1678 (Skene, Collectanea, Appendix, p. 42) says: “Here you may see head-pieces and steel-bonnets raised like pyramids.” In vol. III of A. and A. Macdonald’s Clan Donald there is a picture (opposite p. 54) of Domhnall Gorm Òg, 8th MacDonald of Sleat, wearing a pointed helmet; this picture may have some authenticity (see Éigse XI, p. 11), and it shows ornamentation, which could have been made by engraving, on the helmet. Iain Lom uses the word gràbhailt of Domhnall Gorm Òg’s helmet (Mackenzie ed., line 113).

Gràbhailt(e), used also in line 117, is in origin the past

[TD 201]

participle of a verb gràbhail, “engrave” (BG, p. 371), and is used as a participle (“graven”) in a poem by Iain Mac Ailein (BL, p. 174, last stanza). The participle probably moved towards meaning “helmet” by being attached as an adjective (“graven, engraved”) to a feminine noun meaning “helmet”: the most obvious such noun is cloga(i)d. Clogada replaces gràbhailte in the N version of this line.

In a poem to Sir Lachlann of Duart in 1647, Iain Lom says (Mackenzie ed., lines 818-819):

<gai>
’S maith thigeadh clogaide cruadhach
Air cùl bachlach nan dual glan.
<eng>

401. Dual normally means “lock of hair, plait, curl, ringlet” (Dwelly), but the HSD also quotes from AB the meanings “study, device”. The various extended meanings of dual in Middle Irish have not yet been definitively interpreted (RIA Contribb., 2 dúal), but it may be noted that the corresponding adjective dualach (used in line 898 here of hair) is not infrequently used in connection with sgiath. One of the uses of sgiath dhualach noted in RIA Contribb., s.v. 2 dúalach, is in a poem (RC I, p. 134, st. 5) by Niall Mac Mhuirich (c. 1637–1726); we find other occurrences in Ulster texts of Early Modern Gaelic from 17th-century manuscripts (Mhac an tSaoi, Dhá Sgéal Artúraíochta, line 700; O’Rahilly, Tóruigheacht, p. 36, line 14), and we find sgiath dhual-bhuidhe (?) in a poem in RC II, p. 331, line 37.

The word amlach has a similar range of meanings, being used of hair in line 397 here, and of a shield in BG, line 3127 (amalach; c. 1715), and in an instance quoted in RIA Contribb., s.v. 1 amlach. The basic meaning of amlach is given in the last-named as “variegated, ornamented, decorated”, and it is not impossible that the meaning of dualach, applied to shields, was similar. Thus the meaning of dual here may well have been something like “a device, a design”, the shield being perhaps ornamented with designs of trout—or perhaps of indeterminate fish, for the shields of the 17th century are distinguished for their free style of decoration, which included grotesque animals (Maxwell and Hutchison, Scottish Costume, p. 152); it may also be relevant that a fish (said to be a salmon) appears on the coats of arms of most, if not all, branches of the Macleans (J. P. Maclean, History of Clan MacLean, pp. 342-345). How the design might have been wrought is not clear, but it may be noted that AB (“Irish–English Dictionary”) has a verb dualam, “to carve or engrave”

[TD 202]

(Dwelly dualadh), and the HSD gives a meaning “carved” for dualach, with a reference to E which I have not traced.

402-403. Cf. Watson, Mary Macleod, lines 1063-1064. On the form pistil see note on line 162.

404. Compare the following lines by the 18th-century Maclean poet Iain Mac Theàrlaich, possibly “quoting” the present poem:

<gai>
Cha bu shlacan aig òinsich
Claidheamh mór aig a’ ghaisgeach.<eng>
(BL, p. 242, st. 3)

Dr J. L. Campbell points out to me, however, that slacan aig òinid is a form of a common stereotyped expression, as evidenced in McDonald, Gaelic Words, s.v. plocan.

Stanza 4 might be taken as indicating that the poet was present at the battle but, as suggested above, this is unlikely. The statements made in this stanza are probably statements of how the poet would expect his master to act; or, alternatively, they represent a summary of the information the poet had received, covering the battle up to the point when Holburne fled (lines 374-375, 411).

408. Striking the shield could be an act of defiance, and earlier uses of such expressions are given in RIA Contribb., S, col. 91, lines 37 ff. In a 19th-century Islay version of the tale Leigheas Coise Céin, the king’s son returns unexpectedly from fosterage and arrives at his father’s home: “Bhuail e beum sgéitheadh air an fhaiche agus gheàrr e fàd comhraig” (Craig, Leigheas, p. 4).

412-413. These lines are placed at the end of the stanza in N and ML, and this might be a better place for them, since the next stanza (which also follows in N and JM) begins with a reference to the same historical event.

Eachann Ruadh’s great-grandfather was Lachlann Mór, 13th chief, who may have been born about 1557. His sister Mary was married to Angus MacDonald of Islay, and it was her son, Sir James of Islay, who defeated Lachlann in a battle over the ownership of the Rinns of Islay at the beach of Gruinneard in Islay on August 5th, 1598 (see Introduction, Section 1). Lachlann Mór was killed at the battle (Clan Gillean, pp. 141-149, 251).

419. Perhaps we should follow SO in emending gu fulang to gu’m fulang (gu am fulang).

420-427. This stanza occurs only in N (the source used here) and JM; the JM version of lines 423-427 seems to belong rather to poem no. 3 (see Sources and Readings, no. 3).

[TD 203]

Lines 420-421 seem to indicate that a number of Mull-men escaped from the Battle of Tràigh Ghruinneard and fled to Rathlin. An account in Macfarlane’s Genealogical Collections (I, p. 133) says that the survivors of the battle were unable to launch their boats. But this is contradicted in an account purporting to date from c. 1620 (Miscellanea Scotica, vol. I, Conflicts of the Clans, p. 60), which seems to imply that some of Lachlann Mór’s men escaped in boats under the leadership of his second son, Lachlann Òg, who, according to another account (“Seneachie”, p. 91), was wounded at the battle. The Clan Gillean, pp. 142-148, shows how misleading and contradictory the various accounts of this battle are, so that reliable details of what happened to the survivors are not likely to be established. The tradition implied in lines 420-421 may not be any more reliable as historical information than the other accounts.

425. The do (in N) brings an unusually sharp change of person, from the third to the second. Such changes of person are common in the poetry of this period (as in lines 464-467 and 890-891 here, and see Notes on no. 5; BG, lines 3376-3395; Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, lines 1353-1355). We might amend do to a, but an identical change of person occurs in lines 124-126, which are very closely related to lines 423-425 (see note on line 125).

428. N and ML use the imperfect tense in this line and the next, but the rest of the stanza may suggest that, although the word leibhidh is indefinite, the reference is specifically to the raising of men for the expedition which led to Inverkeithing.

429. HM has ghèbhidh, which JM changes to Gheibhte. Marg is here taken, at the suggestion of Professor Thomson, to be a borrowing from English mark. Mr Kenneth MacDonald points out to me that the OED, s.v. toe (verb), attests the expression “toe the mark” as an equivalent of “toe the line”; the context here may thus be the drilling of soldiers on a parade-ground.

430. Dwelly says that bean-baile may mean “wife of a farm tenant [fear baile]”, but Mr Donald MacAulay suggests to me the additional possibility that here the reference may be to a wife left at home (aig baile) when her husband goes to war.

435. See note on line 121.

439. Cf. Dwelly s.v. riasladh. This line, presumably referring to the destruction of the remaining Scottish foot by Lambert’s cavalry at Inverkeithing, shows that the entire stanza, like the previous one, refers specifically to that battle.

[TD 204]

446. HM has Ga be thigidh air echdrin; E emends this to air hechdri, and JM reads Ga be thigeadh air t’ eachdri. Some emendation to HM seems necessary, and thuigeadh is offered here as an alternative to E’s suggestion. The appearance of -idh for -eadh, and of air for ar or bhur, are commonplace in HM.

448-449. Maclean Sinclair tells us (BL, p. 46) that the reference here is to James Hamilton, third Marquis and first Duke of Hamilton (1606–1649), who was beheaded in London on March 9th, 1649: he had become leader of the Engagers in 1647, and led an army which was defeated by Cromwell in Lancashire in 1648.

The relationship between the Marquis and Eachann Ruadh is rather tenuous: Margaret Cunningham, sister of James, 6th Earl of Glencairn (d. 1631), was married in 1578 (Clan Gillean, p. 111) to Lachlann Mór, 13th of Duart, and was thus Eachann Ruadh’s great-grandmother. Glencairn’s daughter Ann married James Hamilton, 2nd Marquis of Hamilton (1589–1625), and was the mother of the 3rd Marquis (Paul, Scots Peerage IV, pp. 242, 245-246, 376-378).

450-459. In the 1716 account of the Macleans (Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I, p. 126), which may be the work of the scribe of HM (see Bibliography), the following occurs in reference to Eachann Ruadh nan Cath, the 6th chief, who died at Harlaw in 1411: “We have a Tradition That this Eachin ruoidh performed many brave Actions in his Time which justly gained him the Title of Bellicosus, particularly, That he commanded an Army in Ireland, took the City of Dublin & a Fleet that lay in the Harbour with several other Things omitted here because there is no Authority for them but Tradition.”

“Seneachie” (p. 10-11) gives a similar account, and quotes from an unnamed source: “he defeated the king of England’s deputy at sea; landed and carried fire and sword into the country; committed terrible ravages; destroyed many of his enemies, and burnt their houses.” “Seneachie” then notes Holinshed’s account, written in 1577 (Chronicles V, p. 260): “At Whitsuntide in the yeare 1400, which was the first yeare of the reigne of Henrie the fourth, the conestable of Dublin castell, and diuerse other at Stanford in Vlster, fought by sea with Scots, where manie Englishmen were slaine and drowned” (see also J. P. Maclean, History of Mull II, p. 28).

While there are a few other instances in the Annals of Scots fighting in Ireland round about 1400, I have found no instance

[TD 205]

likely to have involved Eachann Ruadh. As Maclean Sinclair suggests (Clan Gillean, p. 53), the above “tradition” concerning him is almost certainly based on the present poem (and perhaps no. 3). But the Maclean chief in the poem is named merely as Eachann (line 450) and, although he had probably been identified as Eachann Ruadh as early as 1716, I would suggest that the reference is in fact to Eachann Mór, the 11th chief, who was perhaps born about 1497 and died in 1568 (Clan Gillean, pp. 90, 106).

About 1533 Eachann Mór captured “ane Inglis schipe” called the Mary Willibe, and was rewarded for this by king James V with a remission of the rents etc. of some of his lands (Exchequer Rolls, vol. XVI, p. 566; vol. XVII, p. 90; Clan Gillean, pp. 94-95). This could be the event alluded to in line 451, suitably altered by tradition or poetic imagination.

After the death of James V in 1542, James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran, became Regent, and Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, who had expected to become Regent, formed an alliance against Arran with king Henry VIII of England and with Domhnall Dubh, grandson of John, 10th Lord of the Isles, who claimed for himself the titles of Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross. In 1545 Domhnall Dubh and other Highland leaders agreed to recognise Lennox as Regent, and sent two commissioners to seek a treaty with Henry VIII. One of the commissioners was Eachann Mór’s brother (or half-brother) Patrick, and Eachann Mór was one of those who issued the commission, which was drawn up by John Carswell.

About the beginning of August, 1545, Domhnall Dubh led a force of 4,000 men and 180 ships to Ireland, and they were at Knockfergus (now Carrickfergus, Co. Antrim) on August 5th; we may reasonably assume that Eachann Mór was among them. It was apparently intended that this force would join with an army of 2,000 from Henry’s soldiery in Ireland, and that the combined force, financed by Henry, was to invade Scotland under Lennox’s leadership. But, although he ordered the 2,000 men to be made ready, Henry could not find the money for the Scottish officers (Gairdner and Brodie, Letters and Papers XX, part II, nos. 40, 41, 120, 198, 295, 304; cf. TGSI XLVIII, p. 550); and when Lennox failed to arrive the Highland force returned to Scotland. Money was then sent by ship from England to the Sound of Mull to pay the army, and Eachann Mór was appointed to distribute it. This might be the “Earl’s dinner”

[TD 206]

referred to in line 453. Due to wrangling over Eachann’s distribution of the money, the army disbanded itself and dispersed.

Nevertheless, Domhnall Dubh returned to Ireland, perhaps in the army of 2,000 led by Lennox, but he died at Drogheda, probably before the end of 1545, on his way to Dublin; I have seen no indication that Eachann Mór was in his company. Eachann Mór is said to have been imprisoned later for his part in this affair (TGSI XLVIII, p. 539; but see Register of Privy Seal III, no. 1534, and Clan Gillean, p. 101).

There is no indication in the accounts of this period of any capture of a royal fleet, or even a royal ship (line 454), or any conquest of Dublin (line 459) or Ireland (lines 119-120). But belief in such a conquest could easily have been built up in oral tradition before Eachann Bacach’s time, or invented by the poet, on the historical basis of the presence of Eachann Mór in an army in Ireland; and line 454 might be merely a restatement of line 451. The “second coming” implied in line 456 could well refer to Lennox’s expedition to Ireland, in which Domhnall Dubh died: while we have no proof that Eachann Mór was present on that expedition, we have no evidence that he was not, and every reason to believe that he might have been. For the historical background to this period see Mitchell, History of the Highlands, pp. 382-386; W. C. Mackenzie, Highlands and Isles, pp. 135-140; Clan Gillean, pp. 96-101, 249; Thomson, Foirm na N-Urrnuidheadh, pp. lxxix-lxxx; RC II, p. 166.

The “Earl’s dinner” of line 453, however, is also strongly reminiscent of the tradition that dinners were hosted by Maclean of Duart in the 16th century when Highland chiefs assembled in Mull for political and other discussions: such a dinner is described in Macphail, Highland Papers I, pp. 45-46; see also Morrison, Manuscript, p. 66, and the note on line 206 here.

If, then, these lines refer to the 1545 period, the 1716 Maclean historian probably interpreted them wrongly, and so also did Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn in a poem she composed in the second quarter of the 18th century (BL, p. 211): after mentioning Eachann Ruadh (d. 1411), she goes on:

<gai>
Gum b’ e sud an comhlan calma
’Chaidh do dh-Eirinn ’s a fhuair ainm ann …
<eng>

In line 452, HM appears to have Finscel, though I am not sure of the first letter: it is not a c-. Since I cannot make sense of this,

[TD 207]

I have taken the cinsgeil of JM (understanding it as a form of cinnseal, and an cinnseal as “in contact with”), and the verb (chaich) which goes with it; the verb in HM is hug.

The spelling Bail’ Àth Cliath in line 459 is taken from Dwelly (Irish Baile Átha Cliath): the sources have bail O Clia (HM) and baile o Cliath (JM), and the o may partly represent a survival of the word Àth.

462. JM alters ma (N, HM, E) to mar, perhaps believing that the poet knew Eachann Ruadh was dead when he composed the poem.

463. Cf. Dwelly s.v. àrmunn.

467. HM has Na chomh sheisha. The reference is clearly to the ùidh of line 466 (aoidh in HM and E), and the lenition of the c-implies that ùidh is masculine, whereas as the dictionaries mark it feminine. JM, reading aoibh for aoidh, has the c- unlenited.

It is, however, possible that HM, in writing aoidh, was thinking of aoigh, “guest” etc., which is masculine; but even if so he was probably in error, since aoigh would make little sense here.

On the meaning of seise see RIA Contribb. s.v.

468-471. The implication of these lines would perhaps be that Eachann Bacach was aware of a secret love-affair involving his chief, and knew that the lovers could communicate only by letter. If there was such a secret love-affair, it is hardly surprising that I have found no other evidence for it.

The lady is named in ML as “Piudhar Mhic Aillein”, but probably the nighean Mhic Cailein of the other sources is preferable: there would be very good reasons at this time for keeping secret a love-affair between the principal houses of Maclean and Campbell. Mac Cailein was Gilleasbuig Caoch (1598–1661), 1st Marquis of Argyll, who had four daughters, two of whom married aristocrats; the youngest died before the age of 14 (Paul, Peerage I, p. 361); in 1651 it was planned that the eldest daughter, Anne, should marry Charles II, but this came to nothing and Anne died unmarried, probably before Charles became king in 1661 (Willcock, Great Marquess, pp. 263-267).

E, however, has a different version of these lines:

<gai>
Ga be thug dhuit cin falich,
Na thog do Ealantin Liotrich,
Ga bi Nion mhic Cailen,
Ba diol Mairesa dhish tu …
<eng>

[TD 208]

While I am not sure of the second line here, this version might be considered preferable, if it implies that no girl, even Argyll’s daughter, was so highly placed that Eachann Ruadh was unworthy to marry her.

472-473. Cf. lines 107-108.

481. HM has mod dheinabh. Mr Neil B. Mackinnon tells me that this form is still common in Mull Gaelic, and suggests that it may represent mu dhéidhinn with the addition of the old dative plural ending, as used in air beulaobh, air cùlaobh. Compare m’ a dhéidhneadh in Appendix I here, line 6.

482. Sud (HM) is emended to iad in E, and to ud in JM.

483. I can make nothing of this line as it appears in HM, the only primary source: Go rig a les agus creafog. Emendations to this include: Go ruig a leas is do chreafag (JM), Ga ruig an Leas agus Treufag! (SO), Gu ruige leas agus creubhag (BL). Another emendation is suggested to me by Professor Thomson: Gu ruig a leac is a chreubhag, “to the extent of his cheek and his whole body (being desecrated?)”.

486. Taisgeal is defined by Dwelly as (1) Finding of anything that was lost, (2) Reward for returning it; the second meaning is quoted from Macalpine. Compare Middle Irish taiscél and taiscélad, the latter of which can mean “spying, reconnoitring; betraying, treachery” (RIA Contribb.).

In a report on the state of the Highlands submitted by General George Wade to king George I in 1724 the following passage occurs (Allardyce, Papers I, pp. 135-136):

There is another Practise used in the Highlands, by which the Cattle stolen are often recovered, which is, by sending Persons to that part of the Country most suspected and making an offer of a Reward (which the Highlanders call Tascal-Money) to any who will discover the Cattle and the Persons who stole them by the temptation of the Reward and promise of Secrecy, discoveries were often made and Restitution obtained. But to put a Stop to a practice they thought an injury to the Tribe, the whole Clan of the Camerons (and others since by their Example) bound themselves by Oath never to take Tascal-Money, nor to inform one against the other. This they take upon a Drawn Durck or Dagger, which they kiss in a Solemn manner and the Penalty declared to be due to the said Oath, is, to be stabbed with the same Dagger. This manner of Swearing is much in practice on all other

[TD 209]

occasions, to bind themselves one to another that they may with more security exercise their Villany, which they imagine less Sinful than the Breach of that Oath, since they commit all sorts of Crimes with impunity, and are so severely punished if forsworn. An instance of this happened in Decemr 1723, when one of the Clan of the Camerons suspected to have taken Tascal-Money, was in the Night time called out of his Hut from his Wife and Children and hanged up near his own Door. Another of that Tribe, was, for the same Crime (as they call it) kept a Month in the Stocks and afterwards privately made away with.

See also Macphail, Highland Papers III, p. 36, n. 2, for a 1677 instance of the use of the word taisgeal in English.

Eachann Bacach seems to have believed that Eachann Ruadh might be alive in the hands of his enemies, and to be urging that he be rescued or ransomed.

488. Here, as in many other instances among the poems edited here, the word seo seems to have lost its demonstrative function and to have become little more than a relative particle. Other fairly clear cases of this occur in lines 64 (see note), 407, 422, 534 (all Eachann Bacach), 993, 1019, 1120, 1165, 1339, 1341 and 1386. An even better instance, if it is not an error, occurs in the MS 14949 version of lines 372-373 (see Metres and Tunes, no. 6): ne sgeulsa so dh’eisd mi. Doubtful cases, where perhaps seo was felt to have both demonstrative and relative force, occur here in lines 100, 140, 143, 197, 372 (Eachann Bacach), 804, 852, 903, 944, 995, 1050, 1105, 1117, 1211 and 1213. These include cases where the form is enclitic.

Other clear cases are to be found in the verse given here under Sources and Readings for poem no. 3 (line 2); in a poem by Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn in BL, p. 63, st. 4, line 4; and in BG, line 6428. In Frances Tolmie’s collection (Journal of the Folk Song Society IV, p. 199) the following occurs for lines 1198-1199 of Watson, Mary Macleod:

<gai>
’Sè bhi smaointinn ort,
So-chràidh mi’m chorp.
<eng>

There are further arguable instances of relative seo, such as: E, p. 232, line 3 (= BL, p. 266), in another poem on Inverkeithing; E, p. 251, line 2, in Iorram na Truaighe; BG, line 4538; Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, lines 863-864; Watson, Mary Macleod, line 613.

[TD 210]

493. For boinne fala, “human being”, see McDonald, Gaelic Words, p. 46; E, p. 269, line 10.

495. ML reads Loch-Cumhain, while N and HM have Locha Buidhe. The former is more likely to be correct, because Loch Buidhe was not part of the Duart estates, as Duart and Aros were (Clan Gillean, p. 505; Scottish Historical Review LVI, p. 37). The name appears as Loch a’ Chumhainn on some Ordnance Survey maps, where the loch opens northwards from Dervaig in the north of Mull; and it should be noted that the same maps mark a house on its eastern shore called Cuin. Mr Duncan MacQuarrie, Tobermory, tells me, however, that Mull Gaelic speakers today understand the name as Loch Cumhann, the second element being a form of the adjective cumhang.

501. Lubhghart (HM, E) is emended in JM, Macpharlain and SO to lùchuirt. Armstrong quotes this line from Macpharlain as Ionad lùchairt nan Gaidheal, “the place of retinue among the Gael”, and seems to have been misquoted by Dwelly.

507. Fhlùr is an emendation accepted here from E to provide the necessary rhyme with dhiùbhail. HM has a bhla and E has a flour.

Compare the following lines by Iain Mac Ailein on the death in 1716 of Sir Iain of Duart (HM, p. 36; BL, p. 117):

<gai>
Rinn e dosgaidh bu mhù dhuinn:
Chuir e ’m flùr far a’ ghàrraidh.
<eng>

510-511. Job, having lost his seven sons and three daughters as part of his afflictions, had seven more sons and three more daughters afterwards as part of the reward for his patience (Job i.13-19, xlii.13). The poet is probably telling the Macleans that, if Eachann Ruadh is dead, God will provide them with further leaders as a reward for all they have suffered.

Eachann Ruadh had no children, and was succeeded by his brother, Sir Ailean (Clan Gillean, p. 253).

513. HM has Caistel, with capital C-; presumably Duart castle is seen as suffering “enchainment” in some way if its master dies. Note, however, Dwelly’s meaning “trunk of the body” for caisteal.

515. The line in HM is Saun fo raisin thachir. Raisin is here taken to contain a form of the verbal ràdh and the masculine emphatic. Other interpretations might involve ràidh, “season” (“in His own good time”), and *ràidhsinn, possibly another form of ràdh, like ràitinn in line 704.

[TD 211]

7. GUR BOCHD NAIDHEACHD DO DHÙTHCHA

This poem is taken from JM, whence it has previously been published in GB, p. 55, and in BL, p. 48. It may be dated to 1651, probably not long after the composition of no. 6, for it is clearly a lament on the death of Eachann Ruadh at the Battle of Inverkeithing on 20th July, 1651. Another lament on his death is Ach ge grianach an latha in E, p. 232, BL, p. 266: it has been suggested (TGSI XLI, pp. 18–20) that Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh may have composed this.


521. Perhaps half of Lambert’s force at Inverkeithing consisted of cavalry (Clan Gillean, p. 193).

523. The “gift” is clearly the chief. Similarly, ùrghibht is used of Iain Breac of Dunvegan in 1693 by An Clàrsair Dall (Matheson ed., line 691), and of Tormod, 19th MacLeod of Dunvegan, in 1706 by Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (TGSI XLI, p. 17).

532. Ceann seanchais ought perhaps to have been translated “subject (of poem)” also in BSC, line 1289; cf. Dwelly’s ceann-còmhraidh, “topic, subject of discourse”, ceann-connspoid, “topic of debate”, ceann-teagaisg, “text, subject of discourse”; ceann mo mhànrain in Watson, Mary Macleod, line 519.

534. Seo is here taken as a simple relative particle, on the strength of the other instances in these poems as listed in the note on line 488. In this case, however, the interpretation of seo is crucial to the sense of the verse. If the word is here taken as demonstrative, the translation may be “Early this morning (when) you moved (off)”, but this conflicts with the evidence of no. 6 here, which shows that the poet did not know of the death of Sir Eachann for some days after the battle.

535. JM has iomrla, presumably representing a dialectal variant of iomrall. HM likewise has iomarla in line 25 of the poem given here as Appendix V.

536. It seems possible that the reference made so vaguely here is to the Ossianic ballad Teanntachd mhór na Féinne, which is studied in detail by Christiansen, Vikings pp. 97 ff. In this ballad Oisein describes the battle in which the Féinne were in the direst straits in which they had ever been (Christiansen, p. 99), and in which a great number of them were killed by foreign enemies (p. 101). Perhaps Eachann Bacach is comparing Inverkeithing with this battle in a general way.

[TD 212]

Christiansen, however, suggests (p. 394) that this ballad was based, to a considerable extent, on the early modern tale Cath Finntrágha, which has been edited from a 15th-century manuscript by Kuno Meyer and by Cecile O’Rahilly. The tale was not unknown in Scotland, for a verse version appears in the Book of the Dean of Lismore (Ross, Heroic Poetry, p. 18), and it has been suggested (Campbell, Leabhar na Feinne, p. 137) that it was localised in Islay. There are some notable correspondences between the prose tale, which concerns an alleged battle at Ventry Harbour in Co. Kerry, and the historical Battle of Inverkeithing. The enemy are again foreigners, led by the king of the world (Meyer ed., p. 2); Cormac mac Airt, erstwhile master of the Féinn, refuses to support them, in the hope that they may be destroyed, and there are other suggestions of treachery (Meyer, pp. 29-31); at one point the Féinn are outnumbered ten to one (p. 33) but, though Fionn contemplates flight (p. 39), the battle continues and results in his death (p. 51); Fionn, having killed the king of the world, is dying of his wounds when Conmhael, son and heir of the king of the world, comes to attack him, but Goll Garbh, son of the king of Scotland, steps forward to defend his leader and kills Conmhael (Meyer, pp. 49-50; O’Rahilly, lines 1293-1306).

537. Cromwell was not himself present at Inverkeithing, and his name here denotes his army.

538. This line is interpreted in the translation as containing two “nominatives of accompaniment”, fearg and corraich, which demand the insertion of “with” in English translation. This construction, arising from earlier uses of the dative case without preposition, was common in the classical Gaelic prose of Eachann Bacach’s time (O’Rahilly, Desiderius, p. 245), but is not a feature of vernacular Gaelic. However, as its name implies, it is normally confined to reference to the number (of people etc.) accompanying someone, e.g. táinig an rí sluagh mór, “the king came with a large army”, so that its occurrence in this line is highly questionable. Perhaps we should emend leum to ghabh, or the like, supposing that leum has mistakenly been substituted here under the influence of leum in the next line.

540. Mac Mhic Eòghainn is the hereditary title of Maclean of Ardgour (Clan Gillean, p. 306; cf. Meek, Campbell Collection, no. 674); in a document of 1685 (Account of Depredations, p. 90) we find mention of “the Clanewin, Ardgours kinsmen and followers”.

[TD 213]

Maclean Sinclair does not make it clear who held this title in 1651, but the title-holder was clearly present at Inverkeithing. The 7th holder of the title was Ailean, who succeeded to it in 1618, supported Montrose in 1645 (Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 333) and had two sons killed at Inverkeithing (Clan Gillean, pp. 195, 309). Another son, Iain Crùbach, held the title by 1657 (Mactavish, Minutes 1652-1661, p. 144), and the word crùbach in his name may make it likely that he too was present at Inverkeithing, whether as leader of his family or not, in view of the statement of “Seneachie” (p. 165): “Of the Macleans that engaged at Inverkeithing, not more than 40 escaped with life, and even those to the day of their death exhibited in the mutilated state of their persons palpable enough proofs of their sufferings upon this dreadful day.”

541. BL emends to Tighearn Chinn-Ghearrloch, and the reference is undoubtedly to the head of the Macleans of Kingerloch. Eachann, 5th of Kingerloch, had fought for Montrose in 1645 and, according to the account in Macfarlane’s Genealogical Collections I, pp. 136-137, was killed by “some Camerons that lived in Morvern” while Eachann Ruadh was chief of Duart. This must have happened after May 14th, 1651, when it is recorded that Eachann of Kingerloch “wes relaxit from the sentence of excommunication” imposed on him in 1646 for his part in Montrose’s campaigns (CH2/984/14, p. 3; TGSI XXXVI, p. 118; cf. Mactavish, Minutes 1639–1651, pp. 188-189). At Inverkeithing the Laird of Kingerloch was probably the 6th holder of the title, “whose name was probably Lachlan” and who lived till about 1675 (Clan Gillean, p. 281).

545. JM has Gu rodh ullan sa Mheachdan gheal threach. I have guessed in the translation that ullan represents uileann, “elbow”, and that the expression is a colloquial one similar to the English “having one’s knife in someone”, i.e. being anxious to harm someone. Compare the following stanza in Iain Mac Ailein’s poem An Sean Duine (HM, p. 2; BL, p. 172):

<gai>
Nuair théid e do ’n taigh òsda, a thòiseachadh ri dràm a dh’òl,
H-uil’ fleasgach barrail bòidheach, le sporan òir is airgid,
De dhearbh chàirdean dìleas dealaidh bha anam an geall orra,
Cuiridh iad gu ceann na h-uirigh uileann anns an t-sean-duin’.
<eng>

546. JM reads Gu rodh taoigh is leith Iola. For detailed discussion of this mode of expression (quoting this stanza) see Matheson, MacCodrum, pp. 287-288; Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p.

[TD 214]

295; BG, p. 282. The idiom is reminiscent of the Middle Irish usage of ar leth noted in the RIA Contribb., L, col. 131, line 6. An instance not noted in the above sources occurs in Leabhar Cloinne Aodha Buidhe (1680), where the alleged conquest of Scotland by the three Collas is discussed: “Do bhensad baile agus leth Alban amach, agus oilén Fionnlochlann le n-aburthur Insí Gall” (Ó Donnchadha ed., p. 49, par. 3). A somewhat similar usage appears in a version of the tale Oidedh Con cColainn based mainly on the 16th-century manuscript 72.1.45 in the National Library: here Van Hamel (Compert, p. 109, par. 39) has the expressions “gilla 7 lethgilla fer nÉrenn” and “fer 7 lethfer fer nÉrenn”. He translates “gilla agus leth-gilla” as “many a lad” (p. 194). The word fer before nÉrenn in these expressions does not appear in the Scottish manuscript, but is inserted from an Irish one.

A list of the Islay lands made over in 1630 by Eachann Mór, 15th of Duart, to his brother, Sir Lachlann, Eachann Ruadh’s father, may be found in the Register of the Great Seal, 1620–1633, no. 1610. While I have found no equivalent charter given to Eachann Ruadh himself, it seems likely that he obtained very much the same lands from his father on March 2nd, 1643 (Clan Gillean, p. 181).

549-550. Bha seems to be superfluous here, as also in line 540 and perhaps to some extent in line 543. The verse is open to various interpretations. For JM’s carragh, BL reads Carragh, evidently understanding the word as a place-name; here it is taken as the common noun carragh, although, according to Dwelly, the genitive case should be carraigh. Perhaps nan carragh would be preferable, this genitive plural being attested by Dwelly.

I have failed to identify the ounce-land of Breatal. Mr Ian Fraser has drawn my attention to two places called “Bradil beg” and “Braadil M.”, located near the southern end of Loch Bà, near Grulin in Mull, on Blaeu’s 1654 map of Mull. However, as he points out, modern Ordnance Survey maps note a place-named “Màm Bhradhadail” not far to the south-east, and a document of 1663 mentions “deneriatam terrarum de Brayadillie, lie Fardingland de Conskebeg”, so that probably the place-name given by Blaeu is not consistent with the spelling Breatal.

This spelling seems reasonably consistent with the second element in the place-name Glen Brittle in Skye, but I have no evidence for any Maclean holdings there.

8. ÒRAN DO LACHANN, TRIATH CHOLLA

This poem is taken from HM, which is likely to be the source of the version in E, p. 297, as well as that in GB, p. 122, and BL, p. 65.

The title in HM makes it clear that the subject is Lachlann Mac Eachainn Ruaidh, 10th of Coll. He presumably became head of his family in 1676 when his father, Eachann Ruadh, died, although his grandfather, Iain Garbh, 8th of Coll, lived for a few years after that date (Clan Gillean, p. 375).

Lachlann may have been in the army already by 1679, for The Clan Gillean (p. 376) tells us that his brother Domhnall, later 12th of Coll, was deputising for him as leader of the family in that year. Lachlann is on record as “of Coll” in 1681 and 1686 (Privy Council Register, 3rd series, vol. VII, p. 83; vol. XIII, p. 10).

Said to have been “a man of a rare military genius” (Douglas, Baronage, p. 368), he was apparently leading his own men in the army before he took his oath as a captain in the Scots Brigade in Holland on December 16th, 1681 (Ferguson, Scots Brigade, I, p. 504, n. 10), in a regiment led by Colonel Hugh Mackay of Scourie, who later led the Williamite forces at Killiecrankie. Lachlann had raised “a number of men” for this purpose at his own expense (J. P. MacLean, Clan MacLean, p. 288), and it is said that “he acted with a good deal of severity” in doing so (Clan Gillean, p. 375). On November 28th, 1684, Lachlann was succeeded as captain by Aeneas Mackay, son of Lord Reay, who had command of 55 men (Ferguson, op. cit., p. 516, n. 3), and it is not clear what then became of Lachlann’s military career. J. P. MacLean and The Clan Gillean, however, imply that he was still in the army at the time of his death in 1687.

Another poem on his death appears in JM2, p. 189 (GB, p. 128; BL, p. 51), ascribed to Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn; two stanzas of it in HM, p. 83, are there said to be “le Inghin Lauchin” but in the Clar-innse of HM (p. IV) they are ascribed to Caitrìona. The following lines from the poem (BL, p. 52) probably allude to Lachlann’s military service abroad:

<gai>
Chaidh thu tamull do dh-Eirinn,
Do ’n Eipheit ’s do ’n Spain;
’S nuair a chaidh thu do Lunnainn,
Fhuair thu ’n t-urram thar chaich.
<eng>

[TD 216]

In 1685 Mackay’s regiment was recalled to Britain to put down Argyll’s rebellion of that year, but the rebellion was already crushed when they arrived, and they were directed instead to London, where “their soldierly appearance made a great impression” (Ferguson, op. cit., p. 476): perhaps Lachlann was with them. The crushing of the rebellion was followed, in July, 1685, by numerous raids by various enemies on the Campbell lands, and the “Laird of Coll” is accused of having taken part in a raid on Glassary in Lorne (Account of Depredations, p. 91). A letter to the Marquess of Atholl, written (significantly) from Inveraray on July 6th, 1685, vehemently denies charges of “abuseing and spoileing the countrie without order” (John, Seventh Duke of Atholl, Chronicles of the Atholl and Tullibardine Families, vol. I, Edinburgh 1908, p. 249). The letter is signed “J. McLaine of Coll”, and it is thus likely that any raiding in Argyllshire, with or without “order”, was carried out by Lachlann’s son, Iain Garbh, later 11th of Coll, who was a minor (Clan Gillean, pp. 376-377). Perhaps it was generally accepted that Iain Garbh was the de facto chief of Coll by 1685, since his father was in the army.

The Clan Gillean tells us (p. 376) that Lachlann was on leave of absence from the army when, in August, 1687, he was drowned in the water of Lochy in Lochaber (“Seneachie”, p. 310). We can therefore date the poem to 1687.

If Maclean Sinclair is right in his identification of the author of the poem (see Introduction, Section 3), then he was a first cousin of his subject.


552. Similar openings occur in five poems in the Fernaig manuscript (Mac Phàrlain ed., pp. 47, 63, 167, 171, 175) and in poems by Iain Mac Ailein (HM, p. 16; E, p. 295; BL, p. 168) and Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Ais-eiridh, p. 134; SO, p. 128). Compare also Watson, Mary Macleod, lines 505-513.

553. Mr Donald MacAulay points out to me the possibility that here caraiche is a derivative of car, “a turn”, and means “that which turns, twists”. This idea would fit well with the sense of lines 554-555, and recall the idea of the wheel of fortune (see note on line 1132).

557. The rhyme shows that the word here is bléid (HM blèid) though bleid is usually written. The rhyme seems to demand the form bléid also in Mac Phàrlain, Lamh-Sgrìobhainn, p. 227, st. 5,

[TD 217]

and in Calder, William Ross, p. 56, lines 16-17 (and see Note C on p. 181).

562. Ma’s e (a) ghlasadh, “if it is its locking”, is taken here, without authority, as a way of saying “even if it is locked”.

564. For masgalach the usual meaning is “flattering, inclined to flatter, sycophantic”, from masgal, “flattery”. This meaning seems unlikely in this context, and I have here suggested an extended meaning in the translation: a similar extension of meaning may be demanded in a poem in BL, p. 25, line 6. But note Dinneen mascalach, “manly; powerful; proud”; possibly the poet intends the ambiguity of a word with two meanings, perhaps “deceptive” and “manly”.

571. HM has chrannan, but the metre demands the added syllable, and we can thus be sure that the nominative singular form is crannan. On the meaning of the word see note on line 175.

578. Séid is taken here as a plural of seud, “jewel, precious stone”, also “reward” (Dwelly); the plural is usually seòid, but the rhyme with teud demands séid. Donnchadh nam Pìos (c. 1635–post 1693), writing in 1688, has the following lines as interpreted by Mac Phàrlain (Lamh-Sgrìobhainn, p. 175):

<gai>
Chreic pàirt diubh-s’ an anam,
’S do chaochail iad barail chionn séid.
<eng>

579. The Coll family have an especially important place in the history of the harp. For an account see Collinson, Traditional and National Music, pp. 237-239, where a harp composition by Lachlann’s grandfather is given on p. 238.

584. On the meaning of pìc see note on line 309.

586-587. For a dh’iarradh HM has a’dhearidh; if a dh’iarradh is correct it does not provide a proper rhyme with féidh, and perhaps we ought to read fiadh.

590. HM has anabhich uoir, opposite which Maclean Sinclair writes onfhaidh fhuair in the manuscript.

592. The sloinneadh which follows is explained in GB, p. 125, and in BL, pp. 68-69, and the notes here are based on this explanation.

594. Lachlann Mór (1557–1598) was the 13th chief of the Macleans (see note on line 412). His grand-daughter Mòr, daughter of Eachann, 2nd of Torloisk, was the mother of Lachlann, the subject of the poem (Clan Gillean, p. 375).

597. The chief of the Macleans when the poem was composed

[TD 218]

was Sir Iain, 19th chief (d. 1716), son of Sir Ailean (d. 1674). Sir Ailean was Lachlann Mór’s great-grandson.

600-603. Eachann Mac Iain Abraich (fl. 1550), 5th of Coll, from whom Lachlann was directly descended, had married Meubh, daughter of Alasdair MacDonald of Islay and the Glens (d. 1536). Alasdair’s grandfather was Iain Mór (d. 1499), and Iain Mór’s grandfather was Iain Mór Tànaistear (d. 1429), progenitor of Clann Iain Mhóir. The reference in line 600 may be to Iain Mór Tànaistear, a more important figure than his grandson in the history of the MacDonalds.

The Route in Co. Antrim, part of the lands of the Earl of Antrim, is usually an Rùta (masculine), see Hogan, Onomasticon. The connection between Maclean of Coll and the Earl of Antrim is through Somhairle Buidhe (d. c. 1590), Lord of the Route, brother of the above-mentioned Meubh, and grandfather of Raghnall Òg, Marquis and 2nd Earl of Antrim (1609–1682) and of Alasdair, the 3rd Earl (1615–1696). The use of the past tense in line 602 indicates that it is the former who is referred to here, perhaps because he was well known in Scotland for his part in Montrose’s campaigns in 1644 and after (cf. RC II, pp. 174, 176, 202, 206).

604. The connection between Lachlann and Dòmhnall Gorm, 7th of Sleat (d. 1692, see TGSI XLV, p. 260), is apparently through Donald of Harlaw (fl. 1411), brother of Iain Mór Tànaistear (see previous note): Donald’s grandson Uisdean (d. 1498) gave his name to Clann Uisdein, the MacDonalds of Sleat. The tùr is common in styles for the Sleat chiefs, and Iain Lom calls it An Tùr Sléiteach (Mackenzie ed., line 2482, and cf. line 105).

The syntax of this line and the next three is unclear to me and is merely guessed at in the translation. Càirdeas is governed by Dòmhnall Gorm in the genitive, and in line 606 by Iain Mùideartach preceded by do: such syntax would be intolerable in prose, but perhaps a degree of poetic licence is to be allowed here.

606-607. Lachlann’s wife was Mòr, daughter of Iain Mùideartach (d. 1670), Captain of Clanranald, who had played an important part in Montrose’s campaigns (RC II, p. 206), and whose marriage took place in or around 1613 (Macleod, Book of Dunvegan I, p. 52). Lachlann’s marriage seems to have been less than ideal, for Mòr went to the Privy Council to claim an increased “aliment” from her husband, and late in 1682 he persuaded the Council to allow him to postpone payment till the following year (PCR, 3rd series, vol. VII, p. 345). Her brother,

[TD 219]

Domhnall Mùideartach, was doubtful in 1683 about Lachlann’s treatment of her (Macphail, Papers of Sir William Fraser, pp. 261, 263). See further note on line 620.

Clannail is equated by Dwelly with clannach, “fruitful, prolific”. One might question the aptness of this epithet to Mòr, who bore only three children (Clan Gillean, p. 376).

608-611. Lachlann’s grandfather, Iain Garbh, 8th of Coll (d. c. 1678), was married to Florence, daughter of Sir Dugald Campbell, 6th of Achnambreac (d. 1643). Sir Dugald’s wife was Mary, daughter of Sir Alexander Erskine of Gogar, son of John Erskine, 5th Earl of Mar (House of Argyll, p. 181).

In line 608 HM has Dughil oig, where we might have expected (do) Dhùghall Òg, but there are other cases of unusual syntax in this poem, especially in stt. 7-9.

In line 609 HM has elontadh, taken here as a dialect form of ealdhaine; but it might also be for the adjective ealdhanta.

612-615. GB and BL emend lines 612-614 as follows:

<gai>
Seonaid mathair Lachainn Mhoir,
’S nigh’n Mhic-Leoid na Hearradh ud;
Bhon thainig thus’ as an cre …
<eng>

“Nighean Mhic Leòid” is then understood (GB, p. 125; BL, p. 68) to be Florence, daughter of Norman MacLeod, 12th of Harris and Dunvegan, who had married Lachlann, 7th of Coll (c. 1582–1642), great-grandfather of the subject of the poem.

As the text stands, however, “Nighean Mhic Leòid” and Seònaid are the same person. Seònaid, daughter of Gilleasbuig, 4th Earl of Argyll (d. 1553), was the wife of Eachann Òg, 12th of Duart, and mother of Lachlann Mór, 13th, and after the death of Eachann Òg in 1573 she married Norman MacLeod, 12th of Harris and Dunvegan (Macleod, Book of Dunvegan I, p. 19; House of Argyll, p. 39). Seònaid was thus not the daughter of MacLeod, so that possibly we should substitute Bean for HM’s Nighin. But another possibility, accepted tentatively in the translation, is that “Nighean Mhic Leòid” was an acceptable way of denoting MacLeod’s wife; this was “a not uncommon usage” according to Watson (Scottish Verse, p. 307). J. C. Watson notes a possible instance of it in his Poems of Mary Macleod, p. 111, but Bannerman and Black (SGS XIII, p. 64, n. 10) are not convinced that such a usage existed. We must therefore either take the present instance as a good example of it or emend Nigh’n to Bean.

[TD 220]

620. An Caisteal Tioram, the principal seat of the Clanranald family, stands on a small island in Moidart (Inverness-shire), close to the border of Ardnamurchan (Argyllshire). Perhaps we should read ’san Àird here, but I have seen no evidence for this place-name.

622-623. The interpretation of these lines here is speculative. The translation implies a long-standing alliance between Coll and Clanranald, for which I have no evidence. A connection with Clanranald has already been made in lines 606-607. It may be noted that, among neighbours of Clanranald, Clann Mhaol-onfhaidh traditionally had a special relationship with the Macleans of Coll (Clan Gillean, pp. 368-369; Chapman, Johnson’s Journey, pp. 121-122).

Air linn could also be understood to mean “across the sea” or even, with appropriate punctuation, “in our opinion”.

Druim air dhruim is interpreted as an adverbial phrase qualifying tigh’nn and having a meaning something like that attested in Irish by Dinneen (p. 372): “one after another; one on top of another; helter-skelter” (see also RIA Contribb., D, col. 411, line 15). Càirdeas seems to be equated, by the word sin, with the pàirt of line 621, yet the càirdeas is the agent for the advance of the pàirt. The highly questionable sentence postulated for the translation is: Thòisich am pàirt barantail ’s (e) … (a’) tighinn air linn gun charachadh. Pàirt is marked feminine in dictionaries.

The opening of line 622 in HM is ’Son chardis, and Maclean Sinclair may be right in reading this as ’S bha ’n cairdeas.

626. For Mac Coinnich E has mac Innabhan. It is likely that E has here emended the HM text (Mac Caonich), for whatever reason: perhaps he had some good authority, perhaps he was merely aware of the relationship between the Macleans of Coll and the Mackinnons. Catherine, daughter of Lachlann, 7th of Coll, was married in 1627 to Iain Balbh, chief of the Mackinnons (Clan Gillean, p. 372). But since the other names in this stanza are those of potential allies rather than relatives, the emendation is unnecessary, to say the least.

In the Clan Gillean account of the Coll family, the MacNeills appear only as enemies during the 15th century (pp. 367-368); but by 1517 they are among the followers of the Duart leadership in battle (Brown, Scottish Society, p. 217).

628. This line occurs again in a Skye song in Frances Tolmie’s collection, Journal of the Folk Song Society IV, p. 218, no. 60, and in the Book of Clanranald the Glengarry chief in the late

[TD 221]

1630s is named as Domnall an tsróim (RC II, p. 174). The reference in the style is probably to the castle of Strome on Loch Carron, which Alasdair, 5th of Glengarry (d. 1560), had legally obtained with the lands of Lochalsh, Lochcarron and Lochbroom on March 6th, 1539 (Register of Great Seal 1513–1546, no. 1924); he had earlier claimed these lands by virtue of his marriage to the heiress of the MacDonalds of Lochalsh (Macdonald, Clan Donald II, p. 380). The castle was given up to the MacKenzies about 1582 (Mackenzie, History of Clan Mackenzie, p. 126; PCR, 1st series, vol. III, p. 505).

637. Professor Thomson suggests to me that the translation “its sod” (with reference to feòil) is “a little strained”, and that we might consider emending to na fòid. E reads theid m foid.


9. ASCAOIN MOLAIDH NA PÌOBA

This poem is edited from N, TM, Inv and HM, and has previously been printed in RC, p. 340, GB, p. 126, and BL, p. 69.

It is usually said (GB, p. 175; BL, p. 91; Matheson, MacCodrum, p. 260) to be the last of four poems in a sort of poetic contention which began with the poem Seanchas na pìoba o thùs (MN MS 6, f. 78b; ML MS 26, p. 3; Gillies’ Collection, p. 291; SO, p. 67; TGSI XLIX, p. 21), ascribed to Niall Mór MacMhuirich (c. 1550–c. 1630). For an account of this poem and for an English translation see Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 186. This was a burlesque attack on the pipes, and Gilleasbuig na Ceapaich, 15th chief of the MacDonalds of Keppoch, replied to it in his poem Mairg do dhiomol ceòl is caismeachd (HM, p. 17; TGSI IX, p. 50; GB, p. 94). If Gilleasbuig was in fact replying to Seanchas na pìoba o thùs it might be held that, since he died in 1682, that poem was composed rather later than the time of Niall Mór MacMhuirich, and may be the work of the Niall MacMhuirich who was born about 1637 and died in 1726 (Matheson, MacCodrum, p. 303; Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 187). But Thomson, discussing the poem in detail in TGSI XLIX, pp. 18-25, favours the ascription to Niall Mór and suggests (pp. 18-19) that all the extant versions probably derive from a single version which may have come from Mull.

At some date which is so far unknown to us, and for a reason that is not clear to us, Iain Mac Ailein (c. 1655–1741) composed his Moladh na Pìoba in support of Gilleasbuig. This poem is

[TD 222]

given here as Appendix II because the present poem, usually said to be in reply to it, is a very close parody on it. The parody is so close, in fact, that there is no internal evidence as to which poem is parodying which, though Lachlann’s poem, simply because it is expressed in coarse language, seems more likely to be the parody. Lines 692-695 date the poem to the period after the Battle of Sheriffmuir (13th November, 1715), and line 688 may possibly indicate that the date is to be placed a considerable time after the battle. None of this, of course, is of much help in dating Iain Mac Ailein’s poem.

For a suggestion that the present poem may be referred to in another poem by Iain Mac Ailein see Introduction, Section 3.

The title used here is taken from N and Inv: TM calls the poem Diomoladh na Pibe, and HM calls it Dan dimolaidh na Pipadh. I translate Ascaoin as “reply” at the suggestion of Dr J. L. Campbell, who tells me that the basic meaning is “the rough side” (as opposed to the smooth, caoin) of the praising of the bagpipe (cf. Dwelly s.v. caoin). Similarly, in a poem by Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (SGS IV, p. 158, line 7) we find the line: “ga mel thu chrabhatta a hoill ascaon do bheoil”; and the common opposition between caoin and ascaoin, as nouns, is exemplified in line 13 of the same poem: “ach cha nainuil mar hachir caon ar ascaoin hà cót” (“inside out is her coat”); cf. Ais-eiridh, p. 27, line 4; E, p. 294, line 4; BG, p. 346.

This title makes it clear that the poem is a parody on Moladh na Pìoba, and not vice versa, and all the indications are that this has been the tradition regarding the two poems; HM agrees, saying in his title that the poem is “anaoidh Iain Mac Alain”.


642. Mr Donald MacAulay has suggested to me that the object of the preposition os cionn here (and in the corresponding line of Moladh na Pìoba, Appendix II) is the noun phrase an cruinne de’n cheòl. Os cionn would normally be followed by the genitive of a simple noun (na cruinne) but, since this is impossible with a whole noun phrase, the preposition de is substituted for the genitive.

Alternatively, Mr William Matheson suggests to me that we might read A chionn de’n chruinne de’n cheòl, which seems to be partly supported by HM (see Sources and Readings).

643. Urram is feminine in this poem and in Moladh na Pìoba, and in a poem by Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Ais-eiridh, p. 124, line 13), as it was in the early language (RIA Contribb. s.v.

[TD 223]

airraim) and still is in Irish. Here and in line 696 and in the corresponding parts of Moladh na Pìoba, the meaning “precedence”, attested by Dwelly, seems to fit the word best. “Prize” might also fit here, but a similar usage occurs in another Mull poem quoted in TGSI XXXVII, p. 66:

<gai>
C’ait am bheil e ’s a’ chruinne
Aon mhac mnatha thug ort urram
Ann an uaisle ’s an grinnead …
<eng>

Compare also line 827, and RC, p. 347, line 26.

645. Perhaps the translation should be “you treated them badly”; Dr J. L. Campbell tells me of an expression used by an indignant Barra woman to a priest who had rebuked her husband: “Gu dé an dìol a bha sibh dèanamh air an fhear agam?” (The priest, a Lochaber man, was irate because he understood this as “Gu dé an diabhal …”).

646. The word arain is so spelt in all the manuscripts (arin in HM), thus perhaps making it unlikely that we are to read dh’ith, the past tense form. The form is therefore taken here, at Mr Matheson’s suggestion, as a reduced form of dh’ithe.

649. Perhaps the use of the English borrowing beid was felt to heighten the burlesque effect of the poem; possibly its meaning was slightly different from that of leaba, and slightly offensive. In the dialect of the Aird in north Inverness-shire beid means “a shallow bed in the ground (as of a hare)” (TGSI XLVIII, p. 364).

651. Flatulence is also associated with the pipes by Donnchadh Bàn (Macleod ed., lines 4639-4640) and John MacCodrum (Matheson ed., line 1048).

654-655. Aimlisg (? cf. Maceachen amailist; SND amplefeyst; Dinneen aimiléis, aimpléis; Gadelica I, p. 41, line 166 aimléisioch) is normally feminine but the form ris would indicate that it is masculine here. The reading in TM suggests do dh’aimleasg.

660. An Clàrsair Dall (Matheson ed., lines 843-844) says in a poem that the pipes are played “le meòir chionalta ghnìomhach/dhrithleannach dhìonach luath”.

663. Donnchadh Bàn too, in his Aoir Ùisdein, compares the sound of the pipes with that of geese, as well as pigs and ducks (Macleod ed., lines 4633-4634). Cf. Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 186 n.

666-667. The reference in ga tarraing is, I take it, to glagarsaich (line 664): the “squawking” is being dragged out.

For t’eachlais the manuscripts have techlus (N, reading not

[TD 224]

quite clear), teachlais (TM) and tachluis (Inv, HM). Eachlais is clearly a variant of achlais, and in another anti-piping poem in TM (RC II, p. 332) we find the line:

<gai>Balgan Cabrach fuigh teachlais.<eng>

But note also Macalpine’s word eachlais, “a passage, entry”.

In Inv and HM mhaidearlach is preceded by the word a, which is presumably the feminine article. The word appears as mhaidarlach in N and TM, as mhaderlach (reading uncertain) in Inv and as mhaiderlach in HM. Mr Matheson has pointed out to me that the word, a derivative of maide, is likely to be an equivalent of crannalach (feminine), a derivative of crann used by John MacCodrum (Matheson ed., line 1020) as a term of abuse for the pipes (cf. note on line 175). Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 1350) uses crannlach as a term of abuse for a ship.

The corresponding line (27) of Moladh na Pìoba is: An ionnstramaid maide nach mór (v.l. mhadin nach).

669. The manuscripts have ga cruas (N) and ga chruas; the corresponding form in Moladh na Pìoba is ga thruas, with the lenition marked in all sources. I have therefore inserted the lenition here, since N frequently omits the mark of lenition, especially with a c.

We might alternatively read dh’a chruas, for the expression seems to be a use of what O’Rahilly called the “dá of unlimited intensity” (Desiderius, p. 254), which was common in the Classical Gaelic of the 17th century and is still common in Irish (Dinneen, p. 299). The preposition do, originally de, with the possessive pronoun a, is followed by an abstract noun (e.g. dá fheabhas) to convey the sense of English however when followed by the corresponding adjective (e.g. “however good”). The HSD, however, gives a similar function to cia, and perhaps this word has had some effect on the Scottish form ga.

If chruas is correct here, the text breaks one of the rules given by O’Rahilly (ibid., p. 253) for Classical Gaelic: “when the dá-phrase follows the noun to which it refers, the pronoun incorporated in dá agrees with the preceding noun”. Thus we would expect ga cruas here, since aigne is usually feminine (though the HSD marks it masculine). This rule is observed in one of the 1694 Metrical Psalms (Mactavish ed., CXXXV.11): “Gach uile rìoghachd mar a ngcédn’/ga hiomadh bhì siad ann”.

Other uses of this expression include one by Mac Mhaighstir

[TD 225]

Alasdair (do lao’d for d’a laghad) in Ais-eiridh, p. 104; an instance in BG, line 1425; and one in Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, line 445.

670. Cartadh is normally used of clearing out a byre or stable, and may be used here simply to heighten the burlesque effect. But the use of this verb for “driving out”, “expelling (animals)” is old (see RIA Contribb. s.v. cartad), and similar uses of it may be found in the works of Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (SGS IV, p. 82, line 8) and Rob Donn (Morrison ed., p. 96, line 26), and in a South Uist song in Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs II, line 718. Here GB and BL, without any authority that I can find, read ’chur for a chartadh.

John MacCodrum abuses the pipes in a rather similar way (Matheson ed., lines 1076-1077, and see note, p. 260). Cf. Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 186 n.

677. At an early stage the bag of the pipes was made of a pig’s bladder, or at least this may have been thought in the 17th and 18th centuries to have been the case. Seanchas na pìoba o thùs, which apparently began this poetic dispute, makes a similar statement (TGSI XLIX, p. 23); cf. RC II, p. 328, line 28. The bag is now made of sheepskin (Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 226).

I have found no explanation for the use of salt indicated in line 676.

678-679. Reference to a bad smell issuing from the pipes occurs in a poem in RC II, p. 332, lines 6, 11-12. Donnchadh Bàn (Macleod ed., lines 4645-4648) detects the smell coming from the piper rather than from the pipes, and in the SO version of Seanchas na Pìoba the smell comes from both.

680. Pipes are frequently referred to as the wife (céile) of the piper (see TGSI XLI, p. 338; BG, p. 290, n. 2967).

682. For the translation of as a léinidh as “in her shift” see BG, p. 278, n. 1760.

684. The ochdar, called ochdar de mhacanaibh fir in Moladh na Pìoba, are the eight fingers used in playing the pipes, and are similarly referred to by John MacCodrum (Matheson ed., line 1073).

Bogadh, which could mean either “softening” or “moving” according to the dictionaries, I take to be used here as slang to denote sexual intercourse (cf. BSC, p. 167, n. 924). There is a similar use of the word in Mac-Dhonuill, Ais-eiridh, p. 32, line 14.

687. The suggestion that mion means “minim” (a musical

[TD 226]

note) I owe to Mr W. Matheson, who points out that the word minim itself is used in BG, line 4949. Mion may be a coining, based on mion, “small”, to replace the English word.

692. The original meaning of dona (RIA Contribb.) was “unfortunate, unlucky, wretched”. Dealing with the coming of king William in a poem perhaps of c. 1700, Iain Mac Ailein says (S, p. 240; BL, p. 97):

<gai>
Ach Alba bheag dhona
Bha gun onair fo ’n ghréin aic.
<eng>

694-695. In HM, p. 43, a note in the original hand reads: “Condulis boy, who carried his pipe at Shireffmuir, as soon as he heard the firing begin, took fright and fled so that when Conduli was to play in the pursuit, he was in the same situation with trumpet Marin, only Marin was flying and Conduli was pursuing”.

Conduiligh MacRaing, also referred to in line 698, was piper to the Macleans who took part in the victorious advance of the Jacobite centre at Sheriffmuir, routing the Hanoverian left wing (Clan Gillean, p. 231). For further information on Conduiligh, and on the Rankin family of pipers, see Matheson, MacCodrum, pp. 251-252; TGSI XXXVII, p. 59.

Hector Maclean’s reference to Marin can be explained from one of the well-known Lowland songs on the Battle of Sheriffmuir. One stanza of this goes (Ritson, Scotish Songs II, pp. 66-67):

And trumpet M‘Lean,
Whose breeks were not clean,
Thro’ misfortune he happen’d to fa’, man,
By saving his neck
His trumpet did break,
Came off without musick at a’, man.

Ritson’s note on this stanza (p. 67) is as follows: “The particulars of this anecdote no where appear. The hero is supposed to be the same John M‘Lean, trumpet, who was sent from lord Mar, then at Perth, with a letter to the duke of Argyle, at Stirling camp, on the 30th of October. Vide Original letters, 1730. Two copies, however, printed not long after 1715, read, ‘And trumpet Marine’”.

The 1730 Collection of Original Letters, pp. 114-117, includes a statement headed “Report of John M‘Lean Trumpet, from Stirling Camp 1st November 1715”. It begins: “I John M‘Lean

[TD 227]

Trumpet …”, and goes on to describe his visit with a message to Argyll’s camp at Stirling on October 30th. At one point (p. 116) “the Captain of the Guard came up to me, and desired me to take up the Trumpet and come along with him …” The statement is dated on p. 117: Perth, 1st November 1715. See also Hogg, Jacobite Relics II, p. 251.

The English word trumpet is attested in the meaning “trumpeter” in the OED, which quotes two examples in which the “trumpet” is used as a courier. In the case of John M’Lean, at least, the courier evidently brought his trumpet with him.

It might be asked if the “anecdote” lying behind the verse quoted above is not a version of that given in HM about Conduiligh. Hector Maclean, however, writing perhaps a good deal less than 50 years after the battle, clearly considers it a separate incident, involving a trumpeter who was presumably on the defeated left wing of the Jacobite army at Sheriffmuir. He clearly knew a version of this song in which this “hero” was named as “trumpet Marin(e)”. This name might owe something to the existence of a stringed musical instrument called the Trumpet Marine (Marine Trumpet, Tromba Marina, Trumscheit).

697. The reference to cabbage-seed is probably, the Rev. William Matheson tells me, a reflection of a tradition in which cabbage is seen as the food of the rabble and of despicable people. Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 265) characterises the Lowlanders as drinkers of cabbage-water, and in Moladh Cabar Féidh the MacKenzies are reproached for growing fat through eating cabbage (Turner’s Collection, p. 25, line 7; SO, p. 360); An Ciaran Mabach (S, p. 486, line 6) praises a herd of horses with the line “Dh’itheadh biolair an fhuarain, ’s air ’m bu shuarach an càl”. Cf. also GB, p. 104, line 6. This tradition is reminiscent of the 17th-century Irish Pairlement Chloinne Tomáis, where the rabble are often depicted as eaters of beans and peas (e.g. Gadelica I, p. 38, line 58).

700-703. These lines occur only in HM, where the spelling is execrable: one reconstructed text may be found in GB and BL. Bioradh here, for instance, represents what seems to be berigh in HM, though the manuscript is not clear. Bioradh is used by Iain Lom, in a poem of 1647, of “mortifying” the Campbells (Mackenzie ed., line 486).

At the time when this poem was composed, MacCruimein, piper to MacLeod of Dunvegan, was probably Pàdraig Òg (c. 1645–1730; Collinson, Bagpipe, p. 145); but, since the past

[TD 228]

tense is used, perhaps the reference is to his father, Pàdraig Mór (c. 1595–c. 1670).

Moladh na Pìoba seems to indicate that the other pipers named here, including Conduiligh (see note on line 694), are Mull pipers. Maclean Sinclair, while preparing Moladh na Pìoba for publication in BL (1898), wrote to Counnduillie Morison on June 25th, 1897, asking for information about these pipers, but if he got any he did not publish it in BL (p. 91). It is, however, tempting to identify Pàdraig and Iain Mac Uilleim as “Patrick M’Neill roy pyper, and John M’William”, whose names appear at the end of a long list of Macleans and their supporters who “were orderly denounced our rebels, and put to our home” by king Charles II in September, 1674 (Macphail, Highland Papers I, pp. 269-270, 272-273; PCR, 3rd series, vol. IV, p. 272), for failing to “compear” at Inveraray to answer for various crimes, including the garrisoning of Duart, which Argyll now claimed (see Introduction, Section 1). Since both names occur together, and at the end of the list, it seems quite likely that they were both pipers. And since both are named in Moladh na Pìoba, it is not necessary to assume that the pipers were alive when the present poem was composed.

Sglùimeach represents the scluimach of HM (which BL reads as sglimeach) and I take this, without authority, to be a form of Dwelly’s sgliomair, sgimilear, “vagrant parasite; gossip, intruder, moucher”; Macalpine’s sgliomair, sgiom(a)lair, “an instrument to take suet off a pot; a mean person that steals out of pots; an intruder”; note also HSD sglìmeach, “troublesome, as an unwelcome guest” (sglìmear). Donnchadh Bàn, also insulting a piper (Macleod ed., lines 4617-4618), says:

<gai>
Sgimilear cheanna nam bòrd thu
Far am faigh thu ’n t-òl gun phàigheadh.
<eng>

Another satire in TM (RC, p. 328), at least partly concerned with a poet named Lachlann, ends (p. 330) with the accusation that the subject would sell his religion and his family for a drink.

Macalpine explains càrd (the HM form) as “an English gallon or two Scotch pints” and marks càrt as a North Highlands form.


10. UAM-S’ THA RÀITINN

This poem is taken from HM, which was also the source for the version in GB2, p. 3, and BL, p. 79. In this case, HM is more

[TD 229]

than usually difficult to interpret, partly due to unusually “phonetic” spelling: the HM text is given in full under Sources and Readings. In HM the poem has the following title, which is paraphrased also in GB2 and BL: “Oran le Awnrdra Mac in Espic nuoir rec a Cnochd mararnuch, is bèder gha agaill les no Camronich bhi goad a chuit Crodh is each, agus nach dag iad dad aig.”

While this information may reflect a historical event in the life of Anndra Mac an Easbuig, it seems to have more relevance for poem no. 12 (see notes there) than for the present poem. The text here makes it clear, in my view, that the poem is concerned with the hard circumstances in which the Macleans in general found themselves after the death of Sir Ailean, 18th of Duart, in 1674. Iain Lom composed a poem, with a rather different slant, on the same difficulties (Mackenzie ed., p. 142).

On Sir Ailean’s death his only son, Sir Iain, was only four years old. In st. 25 the poem expresses the hope that Sir Iain (though he is not named) will succeed his father. The poem must therefore be dated between 1674 and 1687, when Sir Iain took over the management of his own estates (Clan Gillean, p. 218); this range of dates can, however, be narrowed a little.

Argyll’s estates were forfeited in 1681, and he was beheaded in 1685; his son, Gilleasbuig Fionn, did not become 10th Earl of Argyll until 1688, after Sir Iain of Duart had taken control of his inheritance. Since the Argyll “conquest” of Mull had been more or less completed by 1681, we may probably date the poem to the period 1674–1681. While any date between these two is defensible, the most likely dates are those of major developments in the course of the Macleans’ loss of power.

In 1674 Argyll got possession of Duart and Aros, and the legal right to the rents of Duart, Morvern and Tiree, and is accused of “wanton barbarities” (see Introduction, Section 1). But this was very shortly after the death of Sir Ailean, and if this were the date of the poem we might expect a little more eulogy on him than we find in st. 14: he appears to be given no more space than his predecessor, Sir Eachann, is given in st. 19.

The events of the period 1674–1679 are relatively undramatic, but the poem may well have been composed as a reaction to the events of 1680–1681, when the king upheld Argyll’s claim against the Macleans, and Argyll forced them to abandon their last act of defiance in Cairnburgh (Introduction, Section 1).

Line 711 may be telling us that the poem was composed at a

[TD 230]

time when Anndra was away from the Maclean lands (line 712 ?) or Duart Castle (line 726) or his own home (line 707). His own home, whether it was in Knock or in Tiree (see Introduction, Section 4), was in the Maclean lands, now controlled by Argyll. I have found no record of any appreciable period spent by the poet outside the Maclean lands, so that possibly the poem was composed in Tiree (or Mull) after the poet had left Knock (as the HM title suggests). But this is all so uncertain that we cannot draw conclusions from the poem regarding the poet’s life.


704. Maclean Sinclair may be right in reading Uam-s’ tha an ràitinn (BL, p. 79) for Bhoums tha ràtin (HM). Ràitinn is listed by Dwelly as an equivalent of ràdh, “saying”: it occurs in line 1365 here, and in line 33 of the poem in Appendix V; in BG, line 403, in a poem by the compiler of JM; and in Matheson’s Blind Harper (see p. 258 there); see also notes on lines 110, 515 here.

705. Opposite this line in HM Maclean Sinclair writes m’abhaist, presumably as an emendation of màline (HM), but he does not incorporate this change into GB2 or BL.

Tuar is taken here to be the word for “appearance, hue”, and the basic meaning of ri tuar as “similar to, corresponding to”. But the meaning “presage, omen” for tuar might give an acceptable translation for the line: “to presage my weakness or failing”. And since the punctuation throughout is editorial, the colon after this line might well be placed after line 704 and the meaning of tuar taken as “deserving”: “deserving my failing”.

710. Siod seems most likely to refer back to m’àite còmhnaidh in line 707, since this is the only likely referent of the possessive pronoun in (a) mhàighean in line 712.

715. Though I have taken HM’s reading as alt, it does look more like att, which is evidently the form read by Maclean Sinclair. He gives a note in BL, p. 81: “At, atuinn, a rafter”. Macalpine attests atuinn, “a palasado, a rafter”, and says that ataig, “a stake, a palisade”, occurs in the works of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair. The initial a- in Macalpine is apparently short, but McDonald (Gaelic Words, p. 34) has àtuinnean, “… sticks of some kind”, a word which he relates (p. 20) to àdbhuinn, àt bhuinn, “threshold”. In any case, I have found nothing to confirm the existence of a word at, “rafter”.

723. Sheòmbir in HM might equally represent sheòmar, or even seòmar.

[TD 231]

731. The reading nàrach in HM is not quite certain: it involves interpreting a mark over the n- as a meaningless dot, while it is in fact possible that the n- and the mark above it together constitute an h-.

733. The basic meaning of airidh is “one who deserves” (SGS II, pp. 13-14). While the initial a- is usually short, some dialects, both in Ireland (Dinneen, p. 25) and in Scotland, may have àiridh and àraidh. Dwelly includes “worthy” as one of the meanings of àraidh, and arrai rhymes with fáilt in a poem by Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Ais-eiridh, p. 147, line 1).

736. The preas cùbhraidh, the apple-tree of line 740, is clearly a figure of the Maclean family, as in lines 504 and 1067.

743. HM has fier aibh. The first word may, of course, be fìor. For the second Maclean Sinclair writes chaitheamh in the manuscript, and he prints fior chaitheadh in BL. Other possibilities might include thathaibh, dative plural of Armstrong’s tath, “slaughter”, and (with even less likelihood) some form of Dwelly’s athach, “giant”.

746. For the rhyming of dàimh with séimh (sèimh) and mhéinn see BG, notes on lines 3211, 6684.

747. HM has Saobhie Datan ’s chore. The reference is to the Book of Numbers, chapter xvi, where Core (Corah, Korah) and Dathan lead 250 people in revolt against Moses in the desert, and are punished by being thrown alive into Hell when the earth opens and swallows them (cf. Numbers xxvi.10; Jude i.11). The name Dathan appears as Datan in Scottish Gaelic Bibles, and as Dáthan in the Irish Bible.

Saobhaidh usually denotes the lair or den of an animal, but the meaning “the litter of a fox in the den” is attested in Macfarlane’s Vocabulary (1815), p. 111, and in the HSD. On the origin of the word saobhaidh see SGS I, pp. 103, 208.

750. The meaning “cunning, craftiness” suggested here for gliocas is attested by Armstrong: in the early language the meaning seems to have been closer to “cunning” than to “wisdom” (RIA Contribb. s.v. gliccus). But the translation is very questionable: perhaps the colon should be at the end of line 749, and line 750 understood as a phrase somehow subordinate to the sentence in line 751, with ach being translated “except for, apart from”.

752-755. Beside this stanza in HM Maclean Sinclair has inserted the following interpretation (though he omits the stanza in GB2 and BL):

[TD 232]

<gai>
Gach aon duine
’Bhi fo cheum muiseig
Gun cheann duthcha
B’ann d’ar sgiurs am por ud.
<eng>

The form which is read here as cheam from HM, and interpreted as chàm in the text, might also be chrann or cheann in the manuscript, which is not clear. The suggestion here is that càm is a prefixed adjective, the initial of mùiseig resisting lenition because the prefix ends with the same consonant. Dr J. L. Campbell points out to me that an emendation to chuing might also fit the semantic context.

The reference may be to Campbell claims on the Duart estates made in the period 1651–1661, when Sir Ailean was in his minority (Clan Gillean, p. 98), and in the period after 1674, when Sir Iain was a minor (ibid., p. 202).

757. Caraid (HM carid) is understood as the genitive (of apposition) of caraid, so that gràdh caraid, “loved one of a friend/kinsman”, may mean “beloved friend/kinsman”.

759. Mr Donald MacAulay suggests to me that it is possible that the original line here was “Dh’fhàg fàs bhur fearann mór-se”.

772. HM has Ciul cho dollich, and Maclean Sinclair glosses dollich with the note “doilich for duilich”; this may be correct, but cha dolaidh is perhaps just as likely an interpretation as cho doilich. The stanza is omitted in GB2 and BL.

775. HM has Triach da m bollie oglach, which might conceivably represent Triath d’am b’ollamh òglach, “a nobleman whose teacher was a warrior (?)”; the reference might then be to the (regrettable ?) fact that a Maclean chief was educated in a warlike tradition.

776-779. The text of this stanza is fairly clear in the manuscript, but I can make no sense of it. Eachann is presumably Sir Ailean’s brother and predecessor as chief, Eachann Ruadh (d. 1651).

780-782. The possessive in these lines, as in lines 760-763, is ambiguous, the form in HM usually being air for both 1st and 2nd persons; the interpretation here is therefore questionable.

788. See note on line 393.

795. GB2 and BL emend the air tauin of HM to ar n-achain. Tabhann, the barking (etc.) of a dog, is similarly used of “importuning, urging” in a syllabic poem of 1715 by Niall Mac

[TD 233]

Mhuirich (RC, p. 258, st. 51; TGSI XLVI, p. 293), and Dinneen attests meanings like “pressing, urging, constraint” for the corresponding Irish word tafann.

803. This may be the earliest known use of the name An Dreòllainn to denote Mull, though Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., line 1848) uses it in a poem which has been dated post 1678. The name is consistently spelt Dreallainn by Maclean Sinclair, but the rhyme here, and in Iain Lom’s poem, clearly demands -ò-. This is also the case in BL, p. 95, line 6 (Iain Mac Ailein, c. 1689; from HM, p. 6); BL, p. 112, lines 1 and 17 (Iain Mac Ailein, c. 1692); BL, p. 118, line 6 (Iain Mac Ailein, 1716; HM p. 36); BL, pp. 149, line 8, and 150, line 8 (Iain Mac Ailein); BG, line 2548 (Alasdair Camshron, 1746); and the poem given here as Appendix V, line 1.

In BG, line 4082, however, the rhyme seems to demand Dreallainn in a poem by Iain Dubh Mac Iain Mhic Ailein, a MacDonald. This form has been derived by M‘Lauchlan (Dean of Lismore’s Book, p. 21, n. 1) “from ‘dreall’, a ‘bar’ or ‘sneck’, applied to the Sound of Mull, which shuts out all strangers from the Island.”

It has been suggested (Bruford, Gaelic Folk-Tales, p. 21) that the name may in fact derive from that of some Scandinavian province, as Lochlann and Ioruaidh are apparently derived from such province-names (Ériu V, p. 250). The name Dreóllainn appears in the medieval tale Leigheas Coise Céin and in folk-tales as that of a country without precise location. The earliest extant version of Leigheas Coise Céin (which could conceivably have been composed in Scotland, see Bruford, p. 134) is in an Irish manuscript written during the 1480s, and in this An Dreollainne, gen. na Dreol(l)ainne, seems to be located near France (O’Grady, Silva Gadelica I, p. 299; cf. Bruford, p. 20), but generally there is no precise location for such mythical countries in the storyteller’s mind (Bruford, p. 22).

As Bruford points out, other such mythical lands later came to be identified with parts of Scotland: Sorcha with Ardnamurchan, Ioruaidh with Morvern, Tìr fo Thuinn with Tiree, but the identification of An Dreòllainn with Mull is by far the earliest. We can scarcely claim to have evidence that Anndra Mac an Easbuig was the first to make this identification, but it is not impossible that the Beaton family in Mull had a hand in it.

In Irish folk-tales the same mythical country seems to have become generally known as An Drólainn Mhór (Dinneen).

[TD 234]

Hogan (Onomasticon, p. 355) quotes a passage from a manuscript of c. 1700: “do rugadh Sadhbh inghean Eoghain óig … go hInnis Catha go críochaibh glan-áille na Droluinne móire … .i. oileán álainn iongantach ar lár na linge mara.” Innis Catha, if it is to be identified with Inis Cathaigh, is in the mouth of the river Shannon, so that perhaps the Irish were likewise in the process of fixing the position of this mythical land. Clearly, at least in this text, An Drólainn Mhór, was understood to be an island.

The name is clearly masculine here (rah in Dreolin in HM), but where the gender can be detected from the instances given above in the poems of Iain Mac Ailein, John Beaton and Alasdair Camshron (i.e. in the genitive) the name is always feminine.


11. ÒRAN DO DH’ALASDAIR MAC AN EASBUIG

This poem is taken from JM, whence it has previously been printed in GB2, p. 6, and BL, p. 75.

It is a lament for the death of the poet’s younger brother, Sir Alexander Maclean of Otter. My earliest record of him is when, in 1670, he and some others applied to the Privy Council for statutory grants, drawn from the “vacant stipends” of the diocese of Argyll, to allow them to study philosophy (on the source of these vacant stipends see Mactavish, Minutes 1639–1651, pp. xvi, xviii-xix). The application seems to have come through the Archbishop of St Andrews, who was also sent a report, and as a result Alexander was granted 100 merks for 1670, with a promise of 200 merks yearly thereafter (PCR, 3rd series, vol. III, p. 233). He applied again, with others, on January 22nd, 1674 (ibid., vol. IV, p. 129), on the grounds that the vacant stipends in Argyll were by law intended to be used “for poor schollars of the Irish language”. To obtain such a grant, applicants were obliged to give a bond to the appropriate bishop that they would serve, after their education, as ministers in his diocese: this must have been done, for the grant was awarded on December 12th, 1674 (ibid., p. 312).

Perhaps, then, Alexander studied for a time at St Andrews University, but Mr R. N. Smart, Keeper of the University Muniments, tells me that his name does not appear in the extant records of that University. Nor can I find it in the published records of any other Scottish University.

On July 6th, 1676, Alexander and his father, Mr Hector

[TD 235]

Maclean, minister of Morven, are granted by the Privy Council a “protection” to enable them to appear before the Council in Edinburgh (ibid., vol. V, pp. 3-4). This, together with the evidence of the applications for student grants, might allow us to conclude that Alexander was born not later than 1655.

The Samuel Cameron manuscript, which seems to call him Alasdair Greamach, also seems to suggest that he is remembered in Morvern tradition as the strong man of his family (see Introduction, Section 4). The following item appears on p. 5, with no indication of date: “The Campbells came to Morven and took away cattle. Alastir Gremnech (?) overtook them at Otter Ferry or Port na oiteir near Inverary.” Perhaps this episode is in some way connected with the fact that Alexander later became Maclean of Otter.

It was probably in 1682 that he began to act as Commissary of Argyll, a public office which involved the keeping of the Commissariot Record of Inventories and Testaments of the dead (PCR, 3rd series, vol. VIII, p. 103). He is on record as “commissar of Argyll” in a “factory” (RD4/52 in the Scottish Record Office, pp. 92-93) by his father, dated August 23rd, 1682, appointing him to receive the teinds of the bishopric of Argyll, which his father now governed. On March 22nd, 1683, the Privy Council heard a complaint from the bishop and Mr Alexander Maclean, commissar of Argyll, that William Scroggie, who was commissar up till 1681 and had not taken the required oath by the beginning of 1682, was nevertheless continuing to act as commissar in 1682 (PCR, 3rd series, vol. VIII, pp. 102-103). Scroggie later (April 19th, 1683) replied that the bishop had refused to administer the oath to him, but since he could not prove this the post of commissar remained with Alexander (ibid., pp. 146-147): the deed by which Scroggie demitted the right of commissariat to Alexander (RD4/52, p. 759) is dated July 19th, 1683. The affair smacks of crude jobbery, but doubtless we are not aware of all the facts.

Among the bonds in the Scottish Record Office, for summaries of which I am indebted to Dr B. L. H. Horn, is one dated October 27th, 1684 (RD4/58, pp. 192-194), in which Alexander and his father, the bishop, appear as cautioners for William Campbell of Westerkems, who was, or was to become, the husband of one of Alexander’s sisters (see Introduction, Section 4). There are also three bonds, dated 1683 and 1686 (RD4/60, pp. 731-732), for payments to Alexander as factor for the bishop,

[TD 236]

by Dougal Campbell of Glensadell, who later issued bonds to Anndra Mac an Easbuig (see Introduction).

On August 11th, 1685, the London Treasury allowed Mr Alexander M‘Lean, commissar of Argyll, £100 for “expenses to Whitehall on public business” (PCR, 3rd series, vol. IX, p. xxviii). It was perhaps while on such a visit to London in 1687 or 1688 that he had a duel in Hyde Park there with Sir Aeneas MacPherson, author of The Loyall Dissuasive and later father-in-law of Sir Iain of Duart (see Loyall Dissuasive, p. 160). The duel was not fatal to either party, but I have found nothing to tell us the reason for it, the weapons used, or the outcome.

The “Lands and barony of Ottar” were ratified in Alexander’s favour “upon the forfaulture of Alexander Campbell laite of Ottar” on June 15th, 1686 (Innes, Acts of Parliaments VIII, p. 648, no. 78); Lauder of Fountainhall tells us (Historical Notices, p. 692) that Campbell was forfeited because of his involvement in Argyll’s rebellion in 1685. After the defeat of the Jacobites at Killiecrankie the lands of Otter soon returned to Campbell ownership: Alexander Campbell of Otter is on record on January 12th, 1691 (Campbell, Clan Campbell I, p. 7). The Clan Gillean says (p. 303) that Alexander Maclean was knighted shortly after receiving the lands of Otter, but bonds in the Scottish Record Office as late as March 23rd, 1688 (RD2/70, pp. 93-94), refer to him only as Mr Alexander Maclean of Otter.

Alexander may have gone to France with the king in 1688 (cf. line 868 here), but in any case he and his chief, Sir Iain of Duart, were with James when he landed at Kinsale in Ireland on March 11th, 1689, and took part in the Siege of Derry, which lasted from April till July (Clan Gillean, p. 220; Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I, p. 139). According to the account printed by Macfarlane, Sir Iain and Sir Alexander returned to Scotland together when Sir Iain was commissioned by James to lead a Maclean regiment. An anonymous letter (Macpherson, Original Papers, p. 368) sent to “the Queen” on December 15th, 1689, tells how “Sir Alexander M‘Leane” and others defeated a squadron of the English fleet at Gigha in May, 1689 (cf. Macfarlane, loc. cit.; Balfour-Melville, Proceedings of the Estates I, p. 111).

In The Grameid, a Latin poem on part of the career of Viscount Dundee, composed, perhaps in 1691, by James Philip of Almerieclose in Arbroath, who had been in Dundee’s army, Sir Iain of Duart is represented as appearing at the 1689 muster of

[TD 237]

troops in Lochaber with his “brother” (magnanimus frater) Alexander, as “twin” (gemini) leaders of the Macleans (pp. 137-140). The word frater is used in its loosest sense since, according to The Clan Gillean, Alexander’s only blood relationship to his chief was through the brothers Lachlann Lùbanach and Eachann Reagannach, who lived in the 14th century. The Memoirs of Locheill (Cameron, p. 247) tell us that Sir Alexander “brought with him two hundred men out of Argileshire, belonging mostly to M‘Donald of Largoe and Gallusky” and that these acted as personal guard to Dundee during his two-day camp at Keppoch in June (cf. Smythe, Letters, pp. 41-42; Tayler, Claverhouse, p. 251 n.).

The anonymous letter mentioned above (given in Macpherson’s Original Papers) goes on to give an account, somewhat inflated perhaps (see Tullibardine, Military History, p. 255, n. 2), of Sir Alexander’s part in the Battle of Killiecrankie (July 27th, 1689), where he led a battalion on the left of Dundee’s victorious army and distinguished himself, capturing the standard of William of Orange. He is also said to have had a nephew killed at the battle (possibly an otherwise unknown son of the poet’s?). He took part in battle again on August 21st in Dunkeld, where the Jacobites were defeated, and had his leg broken by a musket bullet (cf. Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I, p. 140). He was taken to Blair Atholl castle and later to Duart to recover (Clan Gillean, p. 303; Balfour-Melville, Proceedings of the Estates II, p. 38).

He is still referred to as “Commissar McLean” by the Privy Council on October 31st, 1689, when the Provost of Glasgow is authorised to write to him about the release of a prisoner (PCR, 3rd series, vol. XIV, pp. 455-456). The Council calls him “Sir Alexander McLean” for the first time on December 31st, again in connection with the release of a prisoner (ibid., p. 606), but three days later they describe him as “late commissar of Argyle” and list him as a rebel (ibid., vol. XV, p. 2; cf. pp. 190-191). In a bond of June 13th, 1690 (Innes, Acts IX, Appendix, p. 60), Sr Alexr McLean and others bound themselves to “his Majesty’s” service. On July 14th, 1690, a “sentence and doome of forfaulture” was passed on him and others who had fought with Dundee (Innes, Acts of Parliaments IX, Appendix, p. 54).

The editor of The Grameid tells us (p. 138, n. 2) that “in 1691 he was appointed to intercept the English ships of war approaching Inverlochy”. Soon afterwards we find Sir Alexander

[TD 238]

M‘Lean listed among Scots attending on the exiled James VII in France (M‘Cormick, State-papers, p. 153). The Clan Gillean tells us (p. 303) that he became a lieutenant-colonel in the French military service.

In a poem of c. 1691, Iain Mac Ailein makes reference to “am Bacach”, evidently as an important Maclean leader who might lead a fleet in support of Sir Iain, who was then in the fortified island of Cairnburgh in the Treshnish Isles (bach’ach, HM, p. 47; BL, p. 92). It is presumably the same person who is similarly referred to in another poem by Iain Mac Ailein: if the title of this in HM, p. 7, and in Turner’s Collection, p. 114, is correct, the date would perhaps be 1703 or 1704, as it indicates that Sir Iain was believed to be on his way back from France (cf. BL, p. 102):

<gai>
Nam biodh e dhomh fagus no goirid o làimh,
Sir Iain nan caisteal agus Bacach a’ bhlàir.
<eng>

Here HM has bachach and Turner has bachdach.

Maclean Sinclair writes the following note in HM, p. 47 “Am Bacach,—Sir Hector McLean of Duart was lame in one of his legs.—Sir Alexander of Otter had one of his legs shot off at Killiecrankie”. If the Sir Hector referred to here is the 20th chief, Sir Iain’s son, he cannot be the Bacach of these poems, since he was not born till 1703 (Clan Gillean, p. 253), but it seems quite likely that “am Bacach” may be Sir Alexander, who was wounded in the leg at Dunkeld. If this is so, we may suggest, in the absence of better evidence, that Sir Alexander of Otter, known as “am Bacach”, did not die before 1703 and that the present poem, like no. 12, is to be dated after 1702. The further possibility is suggested in the Notes to no. 12 that we may have evidence that both poems were composed before 1707, so that the death of Alexander and the composition of both poems may be dated between 1703 and 1707.

The title of no. 12 in HM, the only source, is: “Ioram les a daon cheudna nuoir hiuil a bhean aghus fuor a naichd bàs a ghisd bhrarin Sir Alester a hiuil aun Aix la Shappel aghu Iain bharamhadh aun Keyzerwerts”. The subject of the present poem, then, died at Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), and the wording in HM implies that he did not die in battle.


805. The word air was inserted in the JM text, by the scribe, after the line had been written and perhaps, if only for metrical reasons, it ought to be omitted here.

[TD 239]

813. Maceachen states that siaradh means “wasting”, and Dwelly quotes a line from Uilleam Ros where it is used of a person, as it is also in a poem of 1715 in E, p. 73, st. 1, line 2. Cf. McDonald, Gaelic Words, p. 218.

816. The reference is to a syllabic poem (Éigse III, p. 165) by Ó Maoil Chiaráin, in which he laments the loss of his son Fearchar, also a poet, who was slain while on a visit to Ireland. References to this are not infrequent in the poetry of the 17th and 18th centuries (see BG, p. 298; Matheson, Blind Harper, p. 129, n. 720; BL, p. 64, line 17).

817. Oisein, son of Fionn, is traditionally held to have outlived the Féinn by several hundred years, and to have become a Christian. To him are ascribed many poems (e.g. Campbell, Leabhar na Feinne, pp. 47 ff.) which lament the passing of Fionn and his followers (cf. Murphy, Ossianic Lore, pp. 26 ff.; Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, p. xliii). For similar references in the Classical poetry of the 17th century see Aitken, McDiarmid and Thomson, Bards and Makars, p. 230.

821. Since the reference seems to be to fios, we might expect ’S e seo but JM has Shi sheo, apparently ignoring line 819 and relating i to the feminine complement bàirlinn.

824. The word dhe is a questionable insertion. JM has nach rodh n’ Chineadh (the spelling rodh also occurs in JM in lines 842 and 845).

827. Seòl here is taken to be an equivalent of seòltachd, “prudence, craftiness, skill”, a word which must ultimately derive from seòl. A similar use of seòl occurs in a poem dated 1692 in the Fernaig manuscript (Mac Phàrlain ed., p. 229, st. 9).

829. I take this line to represent an inversion of ’S e bhith air thùs bu ghnàths leat, with the e changed to ann by the force of the following adverbial phrase air thùs. A preferable inversion might begin: ’S e air thùs bhith (but see Metres and Tunes).

833. Dwelly defines sgrubair as “churl, niggard, miser, scrub”; scrub, according to the SND, can mean “a mean avaricious person, one who drives hard bargains”, and this is probably closely related to the Gaelic word.

In a poem of c. 1672 (JM2, p. 226; BL, p. 57), Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn uses the same expression:

<gai>
Cha bu sgrubaire clàir thu
’N tùs pàighe na iomairt.
<eng>

In one of the poems called Iorram na Truaighe, perhaps of

[TD 240]

similar date to the present poem (ML MS 125; E, p. 251; SO, p. 391), we have in st. 3:

<gai>
Am measg chàich bu tu chuideachd,
Air mo làimh cha bu sgrubaire bùird.
<eng>

It may be that clàr and bòrd here are identical in sense and necessary for the interpretation of sgrubaire, as one who is too niggardly to put money on the table to pay for drinks. This meaning is suggested by the following lines (S, p. 486, lines 9-10) by An Ciaran Mabach in praise of a horse:

<gai>
B’e mo ghràdh-sa ’m fear buidhe nach suidheadh mu’n bhòrd,
Nach iarradh ri cheannach pinnt leanna na beòir.
<eng>

837-839. As is suggested in the Notes to no. 12, Sir Alexander was the last of the poet’s immediate family to die.

840. JM has Lùinn, but the metre demands a disyllable, and BL has Ludhainn. Louvain in Belgium seems a possible candidate, but I can find no record of any camp there.

845. JM has aun chnaun and, following BL, I have taken this to be due to a slip of the pen which has omitted ad. Professor Thomson tells me that the form cnamhan (as distinct from cnàmhan), which gives the required rhyme with bhodhaig and breothadh, is still quite common as a plural of cnàimh. Such forms seem to be attested in Argyll by Wagner (Linguistic Atlas IV, p. 195, no. 132c) and in Skye by Borgstrøm (Skye and Ross-shire, p. 35); cf. Dieckhoff.


12. IORRAM

This poem is taken from HM, from which it has been printed in CC, p. 202, and BL, p. 77. On the form in which the final lines of the stanzas appear in HM see Metres and Tunes. On the meaning of the title see no. 2, Metres and Tunes.

The title in HM (see Sources and Readings), combined with the internal evidence, indicates that the poem is concerned with the deaths of the poet’s brothers, Alexander and Iain; his wife is also dead (lines 850-851) and he has no surviving brothers (st. 12). The last brother to die seems to have been Alexander, whose death, it is suggested in the Notes to no. 11, occurred after 1703. We may thus conclude that the present poem and no. 11 were probably composed about the same time (cf. no. 11, st. 12).

[TD 241]

Line 868 seems to imply that Alexander and Iain went into exile when king James did so in 1688. After the Jacobites were defeated in Dunkeld on August 21st, 1689, when Alexander was wounded in the leg, Major-General James Buchan became commander of the Jacobite forces in Scotland, and he arrived in Scotland in April, 1690. The 200 Macleans who joined him were led by Iain Mac an Easbuig, now a Captain, and Captain Allan Maclean, “a near relative of Sir John [of Duart]” (Clan Gillean, pp. 222-223, 462). Buchan’s army was defeated at Cromdale in Moray on May 1st, 1690, and among the many prisoners taken were Captains John and Allan Maclean (Macfarlane, Genealogical Collections I, p. 140; Fraser, Earls of Melville, vol. II, p. 153). George Carleton, who fought on the Williamite side at Cromdale, gives in his Memoirs (pp. 47-49) an account of his part in forcing the surrender of a group of about fifty Jacobites, “most of them gentlemen”, who, after the main battle had been lost, retired to the old castle of “Lethendry” with the intention of fighting to the last. Perhaps the two Maclean captains were among these “gentlemen”.

The two were imprisoned in the Canongate tolbooth in Edinburgh on May 26th. On August 2nd they seem to have been offered their release on condition that they fight for king William in the “Provinces of Holland” (PCR, 3rd series, vol. XV, p. 304). Whatever their reaction to this, they were still in the tolbooth on November 3rd, 1690, when the Privy Council suggested that they be sent to the Earl of Argyll “to be disposed of” by him (ibid., pp. 514-515). On July 2nd, 1691, it was recommended to Argyll that he exchange them for some seamen who had been captured by the Macleans (including, perhaps, Iain’s brother, Sir Alexander, see no. 11, Notes) while on their way to Inverlochy, and were being held in Duart castle (ibid., vol. XVI, p. 386). Whether this was done or not I do not know.

Maclean Sinclair says (Clan Gillean, p. 303) that Iain was a lieutenant in the Earl of Portmore’s regiment of Foot. He does not name his source of information but, if this is correct, Iain, unlike Alexander, joined the government’s army, and is probably the “Jno. Maclean” who was commissioned as a lieutenant in Sir David Colyear’s Regiment of Foot on January 6th, 1696 (Dalton, Lists IV, p. 136). This regiment was embodied for king James at Musselburgh in 1688, and in 1701 was sent by king William to fight in the Scots Brigade for the Dutch Government, under the leadership of David Colyear (1675–1730), Lord

[TD 242]

Portmore, who became Earl of Portmore in 1703 (Ferguson, Scots Brigade, vol. II, pp. 3 ff.).

The title of the present poem in HM tells us that Iain was killed in Keyzerwerts. We cannot be absolutely sure, but there is little room for serious doubt that he died during the Siege of Kaiserswerth. This was one of the first engagements in which Portmore’s Regiment was involved, when French forces were successfully besieged by English and Dutch troops in the Rhine fortress of Kaiserswerth, now one of the northern suburbs of Düsseldorf, for about two months from April 16th, 1702 (Dickson, Red John, p. 30). This siege is also notable because it was there that Iain Ruadh nan Cath, 2nd Duke of Argyll, later the leader of the government forces at Sheriffmuir, first obtained recognition for his ability as a soldier (ibid.). A long account in English verse of the exploits of Portmore’s Regiment, by John Scot, who served in it, is printed in Ferguson, Scots Brigade, vol. III, pp. 307 ff. This includes an account of the Siege of Kaiserswerth, which has the lines (p. 328):

Bot to reckon the coast right many was loost
Which ther had goten ther death
Two valiant Captans in our regiment then was
Was wounded and after lost breath
Six of our Subeltenants stout and couragious
Was killed on this fatal pice ground.

Since Iain Mac an Easbuig, then, died at this siege in 1702, it is likely that the present poem, like no. 11, was occasioned by the death of Alexander, which occurred at some time after 1703.

Parts of stt. 6, 7, 9 and 13 indicate that the poet was suffering harassment from enemies, from whom he now felt himself to be undefended, and who, he felt, showed little respect for the gentry (line 872). It is possible that these enemies are the Cameron marauders who are mentioned in HM in the title given there for no. 10 here (see Notes): according to HM they eventually forced Anndra to leave Knock. Since this HM title does not seem to fit no. 10, it may be that it is derived from information which was originally concerned with explaining the present poem, and was misinterpreted by the scribe of HM or one of his sources. On the basis of this speculation we might suggest that the poet left Knock after the date of this poem, which is approximately the date of the death of Alexander. We find the poet in Tiree at some time between 1703 and 1707 (see Introduction, Section 4):

[TD 243]

therefore the death of Alexander and the composition of the present poem and of no. 11 are to be dated between 1703 and 1707. But all this is highly conjectural.


846-848. A version of the same stanza opens an anonymous post-1745 Oran do fhear Dhungalain in Turner’s Collection, p. 278:

<gai>
Gur cràiteach a mheadhail
Tha ’n dràsd a tigh’n fodhainn,
Ann an trath an fhoghair ’s na buana.
<eng>

Following the hint of the word trath here, I have taken dàmhair in the present poem to be a term for a period of time, especially in Autumn, as is suggested by most of Dwelly’s examples. But Dwelly also gives the word the meaning “middle”, which is possible here.

On othail (HM ouil), “confusion, bustle”, and meadhail, see note on line 99 here, and SGS III, pp. 61-62.

851. See note on line 121.

857. I have failed to find any other instance of the word Lunnach (HM). Professor Thomson suggests to me that it may be virtually synonymous with suanach, and based on lunn, “roller” etc.; lunnach might thus be cloth supplied on a roller, a “bolt” of cloth.

860. I have seen no other instance of the word cros-tuagh, and the translation “cross-axe” is meaningless to me. Mr Donald MacAulay suggests that a double-bladed axe may be intended.

865. The context suggests that cunnarach cladaich, “beach-bargain”, should denote a bargain which involves the buyer in little expense. The reference may be to beachcombing, by which useful things may be picked up without cost, and probably some traditional saying or proverb is in the poet’s mind here.

874. This is the only evidence I know of that Iain was married. Neither brother, it would seem from line 886, had a son alive when the poem was composed, but Alexander, who is said to have had a nephew killed at Killiecrankie (see no. 11, Notes), is said in the Samuel Cameron manuscript to have had descendants (see Introduction, Section 4).

876. HM has bári. On àiridh see note on line 733.

879-881. Coire is taken as feminine here, though it is usually masculine: HM has na coire. However, other possibilities which would leave coire masculine include the interpretation of the na of

[TD 244]

HM as nan, and coire as genitive plural; and perhaps understanding na coire as representing ann an coire, “in a corrie”.

For line 881 HM has: ’S cha bu doithabh O - - ro daoire as no bhuaineadh. The rhyming system shows that daoire must be for doire. Although there is no corroborating evidence, I have taken ro to be the last of the meaningless vocables, and have inserted an, believing it to have been elided between this ro and doire. Maceachen defines doimheamh as “vexed, grieved, sad”; cf. Meek, Campbell Collection, no. 114: doitheamh, “cross”.

884. This line probably depends for its effect on the audience’s acquaintance with the proverb “Is maol guala gun bhràthair” (Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs, p. 270.7).


13. AINDRA MC GHILÉOIN C̅C̅.

This poem is copied, without alteration, from the 5th page of the Preface to AB; it has not, as far as I know, been printed elsewhere.

There are several reasons for printing this poem and no. 17 exactly as they stand in AB. Because they were composed, as far as we can tell, specifically for inclusion in AB, it is fair to assume that we have the authors’ own text, or one very near to it: this cannot be said with the same conviction of any of the other poems edited here. Any change to the text, aimed at standardising the spelling in order to bring it into line with that of the other poems edited here, would obscure any pointers in the AB spelling to the poets’ understanding of the Gaelic tradition of writing. And, since the language of both poems is a broken-down form of Classical Gaelic rather than true vernacular Scottish Gaelic, to standardise either to Classical Gaelic or to modern Scottish Gaelic would be impossible without distorting the text. No standardisation, in any case, is likely to add much to our understanding of the poem.

Even so, the translation given here assumes two changes in the text (see notes on lines 890 and 892 below).

The poem is the first of thirteen which appear at the end of the Preface in AB; of the other twelve, six are of Scottish origin, the work of J. Keill, “Scoto-Britannus”; Andreas Frazier, “Eccl. Scot. Presb.” (possibly Andrew Fraser, ordained 1682, “deprived” of the ministry of Rothesay 1689, died 1711; see Scott, Fasti 4, pp. 37, 40); Colin Campbell of Achnaba (1644–1726), minister of

[TD 245]

Ardchattan in Lorne (see Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, pp. xix, 4); Robert Campbell, “Fear Faraiste mhic Chailin an Comhal” (cf. Mackechnie, Dewar Manuscripts, pp. 144, 309, 315; SGS XII, p. 306); Seumas Mac Mhuirich (d. 1712), minister of Kildalton in Islay (cf. Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. xix; his poem appears also in Pattison’s Gaelic Bards, p. 201); and Maighstir Seathan (no. 17 here). The first 11 of the 13 poems were probably composed in order to counteract in some measure the criticisms of his work which Lhuyd had heard before the publication of AB and to which he alludes in his Preface (5th page). Since the material for AB was in the process of being collected and printed throughout the period 1703–1707 (Gunther, Life and Letters, pp. 448, 451), this poem can be dated to c. 1705.

The “c̅c̅.” in the title represents Latin cecinit, “sang”, and commonly occurs in the headings of Classical Gaelic poetry (Knott, Irish Classical Poetry, p. 18).


888. Literally “Famous (is) your company in noble deed”. Comhluinn I take to be an alternative form (dative in origin) of the feminine noun comhlann, “troop, band, complement of men” (Dwelly). But perhaps it is a plural of comhlann, “companion, colleague; assistant” (Dwelly), which was neuter or masculine in the earlier language (RIA Contribb. comlann) and may be masculine in Irish (Dinneen).

Lhuyd had at least one companion with him when he came to Scotland, namely David Parry, author of the British Etymologicon in AB, p. 266; and elsewhere he had various assistants (Gunther, Life and Letters, pp. 25, 30).

889. Beirid is the synthetic 3rd person plural form, present tense, of beir in Classical Gaelic (O’Rahilly, Desiderius, p. xxvi).

890. In the translation I have understood do chur as do chuir. Or is here taken to be the preposition o with the possessive pronoun, 1st person plural (ar), but the -r could equally well represent the 2nd person plural, (bh)ur. Similarly, the do in do na thuit could well represent de, as in line 891. Lines 890-891 might thus be translated: “A man who, from all that has come down from (y)our ancestors, caused much of the beauty of your time to be celebrated.”

891. Bhur can only be the plural possessive used respectfully in addressing Lhuyd. This appears to be an instance of the shift from the 3rd person (Ti in line 890) back to the 2nd person (as in line 888); see note on line 425.

[TD 246]

892. Molfid looks like a Classical Gaelic future, 3rd person plural (O’Rahilly, Desiderius, p. xxviii). But if it is understood as such, meaning “praise”, with “Mc Liath” as object, it is hard to make sense of the lines which follow, or to be sure of the subject of the verb. I have therefore understood the form intended to be molfaidh, the -h having been omitted either by an error or because of the influence of the Gaelic manuscript tradition, which frequently leaves the lenition of b, d, g and m unmarked.

Since capital letters are used in the poem only at the beginnings of lines and in names, Seanchas is here taken as referring to AB itself, the full title of which is: Archaeologia Britannica, giving some account Additional to what has been hitherto Publish’d, of the Languages, Histories and Customs Of the Original Inhabitants of Great Britain. Seumas Mac Mhuirich and Robert Campbell, on the other hand, in their poems in the Preface, call AB a dictionary (focloir).

The Welsh word llwyd, of which Lhuyd is a mis-spelling, can mean “grey”, and is a cognate of the Gaelic word liath. The fact that Anndra shows, by using Mc Liath for Lhuyd, that he knew one or both of these facts indicates some contact, direct or indirect, with Lhuyd himself. The equivalence of llwyd and liath was also known to Maighstir Seathan (see line 1194) and to Seumas Mac Mhuirich who, in his poem in AB, calls Lhuyd Maisdir Líath.

893. Ochd mhacigh’achd represents ochd-mhacaigheachd, but the apostrophe may be intended to indicate that this compound is to be read as a trisyllable. Even so, the line remains hypermetrical as written, and undoubtedly oirinn is to be read as a monosyllable (on its rhyme with loirg see note on line 129).

Elsewhere the second element of the compound is macachd and it may be that Anndra, in writing a disyllabic macigh’achd, is showing a knowledge of an opposition between Classical Gaelic -(a)igheacht and modern Gaelic -(e)achd (e.g. scéalaigheacht/sgeulachd; barraigheacht/barrachd), and that the form known to the poet was in fact ochd-mhacachd.

Carswell (1567) has macacht ochta (Thomson ed., line 1803), as has Calvin’s Catechism of c. 1630 (Thomson, Adtimchiol, p. 12, line 2). In the second edition (1659) of the Shorter Catechism the form is ochdmhacachd (ibid., p. 237.34), and Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair’s Galick Vocabulary (1741, p. 180) has Uchdmhacachd, a form used in the Bible (Gal. iv.5; Eph. i.5).

The meaning in these Scottish religious sources is “adoption”

[TD 247]

(Thomson, Foirm na n-Urrnuidheadh, p. 148; Adtimchiol, pp. 119, 237.34), a meaning not attested in the medieval sources (see RIA Contribb., M, col. 7, line 19). Apart from the religious connotation, this meaning seems to fit the present context best. The term mac uchd (originally mac ochta, “a favourite, darling”, RIA Contribb., loc. cit.) may still be known in colloquial Gaelic (Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs, p. 180.8), even if its meaning is unknown.

The “adoption” referred to may be simply the recognition, as a result of Lhuyd’s work, that Scottish Gaeldom had a place among the nations, especially among those in Britain. But it is hard, taking the succeeding lines into account, to avoid the conclusion that Anndra is here referring specifically to the political debate which led to the Treaty of Union, ratified on January 16th, 1707, in Edinburgh, with effect from May 1st in the same year (Menzies, Scottish Nation, p. 157). If so, Anndra was clearly a supporter of the Union.

895. Ceart na loirg might equally well be translated “as a direct result of it”.

The line is hypermetrical: again Anndra is probably showing off his knowledge by writing a form of Classical Gaelic tabhairt, while “hearing” the vernacular form toirt.

The spelling ccuimhne reflects the common Classical practice of writing an eclipsed c- double instead of prefixing a g- (cf. O’Rahilly, Desiderius, p. xvii).


14. ÒRAN DO BHARBRA NIGHEAN EASBUIG FULLARTON

My only primary source for this poem is HM, since it is likely to be from there (see Sources and Readings) that the printed versions derive, directly or indirectly; these are: E, p. 300; Mackenzie, Cruiteara Gaelach, p. 20; Harp of Caledonia, p. 22; CC, p. 200; GB2, p. 2; BL, p. 73.

The identification of the subject is clearly made in the title in HM, and we have no good reason to question it. John Fullerton of Greenhall in Glendaruel in Cowal was born about 1645, son of James MacCloy or MacLoy of Ballochindryan. Ó Rathile has suggested (Mhac an tSaoi, Dhá Sgéal Artúraíochta, p. 84) that the family name was originally Mac Lughaidh (cf. TGSI XXII, p. 155): this might be confirmed by the spelling Mack-Louis

[TD 248]

which he notes, by the spelling MacLewie quoted in Keith’s Historical Catalogue, p. 525, and, to some extent, by the Arran pronunciation “Ac Lothaidh” (Celtic Review IV, p. 170). Confusion of the patronymic Lughaidh with luadhaidh, genitive case of luadhadh, “waulking, fulling”, then led, Ó Rathile suggests, to the “translation” form Fullerton or Fullarton.

John Fullerton received his M.A. at Glasgow University in 1665 and was ordained as minister of Kilmodan by 1669. He is presumably the John McCloy who, on September 3rd, 1674, was appointed by the Privy Council (Register, 3rd series, vol. IV, p. 280; Mactavish, Gaelic Psalms, p. xii), along with other ministers, to scrutinise Robert Kirk’s translation into Gaelic of the last 100 Psalms. By 1684 he had moved to the parish of Paisley, and he was “outed” at the revolution of 1688. He became a bishop on January 25th, 1705, and Bishop of Edinburgh in 1720. He died at Greenhall on April 27th, 1727 (see Craven, Records, pp. 179 ff.).

According to Scott’s Fasti (vol. 3, p. 165), from which most of the above facts are taken, his first wife, Anna, died in July, 1679, and before 1682 he had married Barbara Hamilton. Scott lists five children by this second marriage, Barbara being the fifth: perhaps this means that she was the youngest of the five. She was married in 1718 to Patrick Lamont of Stronalbanach. (Another daughter, not listed by Scott, named Katherine, is listed in the Index to the Argyll Sasines in documents dated August 21st, 1729, and December 13th, 1731; cf. Craven, Records, p. 181).

If we accept that the poet was born about 1635 (see Introduction, Section 4), clearly Barbara Fullerton was young enough to be his grand-daughter. Since the poem is a love-poem, we might therefore question the HM title, suggesting that the author is not Anndra, or that the subject is not this Barbara Fullerton.

However, love poems are somewhat rare in the extant literature of the first quarter of the 18th century, if the work-song tradition is excluded, and the closest contemporary parallels to this poem seem to be the syllabic dánta grádha, love-poems which flourished in the literate Gaelic world from the 14th century till the 18th (see Robin Flower’s Introduction to Ó Rathile’s Dánta Grádha; Thomson, Introduction, p. 52; Ó Cuív, Seven Centuries of Irish Learning, p. 102). Ó Rathile believed (Dánta Grádha, title page) that this courtly poetry was still being composed up

[TD 249]

till about 1750, so that it is quite possible that Anndra, whom no. 13 here shows to have been acquainted with the literate tradition, might have come in contact with this aspect of the tradition. Nos. 18 and 19 here show that he was not the only Scottish vernacular poet of this period to do so.

In this literary romantic poetry the woman is placed on a pedestal, as it were, and loved from a distance by the inferior male poet. Her beauty is praised and idealised and the poet suffers in his love, often claiming that he will die if his love is not returned (cf. lines 934-935). Much of this poetry is addressed to women who are in fact unattainable, often being already married: a basic concept behind the whole tradition is that the finest part of love is desire, whether fulfilled or not (see Ó Tuama, An Grá, p. 3; Ó Cuív, Seven Centuries, p. 105). Many of the ideas of this type of poetry become commonplace in the later 18th-century love-songs, notably those of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair and Uilleam Ros, and for this reason we might well regard the present poem and nos. 18 and 19 as pioneers of 18th-century Gaelic poetry rather than part of the 17th-century tradition to which nos. 10-12 here might be held to belong.

It seems consistent to me, then, to suggest: the present poem was composed by an old man to a young woman, as a literary exercise on the pattern of the dánta grádha; the subject is safely unattainable to the poet because of the discrepancy between their ages; perhaps the poem was, in some sense, presented to its subject as a compliment; st. 12 seems to indicate that the protestations of love are not intended to be taken seriously; and no. 18 (see Notes) appears to have been composed in similar circumstances.

E adds the date 1698 to the title, without giving any reason for doing so. It is perhaps possible, unless Barbara was the fifth child of Bishop Fullerton’s second marriage (see above), that she was born about 1680, and was therefore a beautiful young woman in 1698. But since we do not know what authority E had for the date 1698, it is at least equally possible that the poem dates from a period somewhat closer to the date of her marriage, 1718.

For many of the notes given here, as well as many of those given for nos. 18 and 19, and for the references to DG (Ó Rathile, Dánta Grádha), I am indebted to Miss Helen O’Sullivan, who has made a specialised study of Celtic love poetry up till the 17th century.

[TD 250]

897. HM has na ’cuaich famanach and E has na cuaich fainagich. I take fàmannach to be a form of Middle Irish fathmannach, described in the RIA Contribb. as “epithet of hair: in locks or coils (?), thread-like, fine (?)”. This word is not attested by Dwelly or Dinneen, but is noted in the RIA Contribb. as famuineach in a text from an early-18th-century Ulster manuscript (Hyde, Giolla an Fhiugha, p. 122, line 24); it may be noted that a Munster version of the text substitutes the word fáinneach (n. 5).

898. HM reads orbui e, and the change from o- to à- is demanded by the rhyme. In many poems in DG (cf. Flower’s Introduction, p. xx) great emphasis is laid on the beauty of the subject’s hair (e.g. DG nos. 5, 13, 89), which is often said to be golden.

899. Comparison of the hair with harp-strings, common in Scottish vernacular poetry (e.g. Watson, Mary Macleod, p. 154; BSC, line 100; Macleod, Duncan Ban, line 1582), does not occur in DG.

900. The beauty of the cheeks is referred to in DG nos. 1.15, 40.3; cf. also note on line 1368 here.

903. With considerable hesitation, I have taken -sa here to be simply a relative particle: for instance of similar usages see note on line 488. This, however, is the only case here where the noun preceding -sa/seo is not preceded by the article. If we understand an article before Diàna, this might imply a reference to some particular human lady named Diàna, who has recently died.

It seems more likely to me that the reference is to the Roman goddess Diana, and that chaidh eug merely implies that the Roman civilisation of which Diana was a part has died out. References to Diana and other classical figures are common in the dánta grádha (Ó Cuív, Seven Centuries, p. 112) and in later 8th-century poetry. Uilleam Ros has the lines (Calder ed., p. 60, lines 39-40; SO p. 385):

<gai>
’S gach buaidh a b’àilli, bh’ air Diàna,
Gu leir mar fhàgail, tha aig Mòir.
<eng>

906. See note on line 1263.

908. HM has a nam marran, which might represent ann am mànran, “in festivity”.

911. See note on line 1250.

[TD 251]

912. The sweetness of the subject’s kiss is likened to honey in DG nos. 16.45 and 78.5.

914-915. In DG the woman’s presence (e.g. nos. 16.1-2, 37.25-26) or kiss (no. 16.45) is a cure for illness. See also Calder, William Ross, p. 62, lines 49-50. Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair says of Mòrag (Poems, p. 150): “’S fàileadh a’ mhusga de h-anail”.

916-917. The beauty of the subject’s breast (cf. also line 943) is praised in DG nos. 25.20, 100.19-20. Perhaps we should read ’M bheil in line 917.

918-919. The loved one steals the poet’s heart in DG no. 49.1, and commonly in later poetry (e.g. Calder, William Ross, p. 58, line 15); love is depicted as a captivity in DG nos. 39.28 and 48.14.

920. Slimness is a common item of praise in DG, as in nos. 1.17 and 25.9.

921. The beauty of the calf of the leg is praised in DG nos. 98.15 and 99.19; in no. 26.13 the words maol and glún are used together.

922. The beauty of the foot is praised in DG nos. 31.3 and 104.14, the words troigh and cruinn occurring together in no. 102.21.

Here HM has gharacolach, presumably omitting a final -d, as is also done in lines 913 (amideach) and 925 (leanabanach). I have taken the spelling from Watson’s adjective garbhcail, “rough, coarse” (BG, p. 332, n. 6353), occurring in a poem which he would date c. 1620. Maceachen and Dieckhoff have the adjective as garracail, and Dwelly has the nouns garbhacail and garbhaiceil for “gulping, bolting, devouring food”. McDonald (Gaelic Words, p. 137) has garraiceal, “voracious, greedy, gluttonous”. Cf. Irish garbhuaic (Dinneen; Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge V, pp. 110.8, 142.54).

924-927. The spread of the subject’s fame outside her own country may be compared with a similar item of praise for male subjects in Watson, Mary Macleod, lines 627-630.

929. Mr Donald MacAulay tells me that in the dialect of Bernera, Lewis, cruaidh-shnaim is the term for a “reef-knot”, as opposed to ruith-shnaim, “running knot”; Dieckhoff has cruaidh-shnaim, “a hard knot”. Cf. Dwelly s.v. snaim.

932-933. The idea of the poet receiving hate instead of love is parallelled in DG nos. 85 and 89.

935. In DG love, or the subject’s beauty, is frequently said to be a cause of death, e.g. nos. 18.18, 20.29-30.

936-937. In HM these lines read:

[TD 252]

<gai>
Co chuala aigh na chunnig e
Na fthuair a naidar duin is’ a.
<eng>

The interpretation here is therefore highly questionable. E has ad naidar tunnichidh and BL has ’san nadar duine-sa.

The expression used in these lines may owe something to 1 Cor. ii.9.

939. HM has A chunnich; we might expect a verbal noun form here instead of the past tense, and BL reads An cruinneachadh ’na cre.

941. For HM’s diubhaltach we might alternatively read diùbhaltach, as a possible form of dìobhalach; but the meaning (“destructive; damaged; hurtful”) seems less likely in the context. With the form used here compare diùghailt in line 958.


15. ÒRAN DO DHÒMHNALL, FEAR BHRÒLAIS

This poem is edited from HM, p. 50, and has been printed from the same source in CC, p. 207, GB2, p. 50, and BL, p. 217.

It is a lament on the death of Dòmhnall, 3rd Maclean of Brolas, which occurred, according to The Clan Gillean, p. 467, on April 23rd, 1725. Maclean Sinclair does not provide evidence for this date, but J. P. Maclean (Clan MacLean, p. 225) confirms that the year was 1725. We can therefore date the poem to that year (cf. line 944).

The Clan Gillean tells us that Dòmhnall was born in 1671, was left fatherless at the age of 16 (cf. line 1139, note), became a lieutenant in the British army “and was, on one occasion, badly wounded by a trooper’s sabre”. “Seneachie” (p. 228) places this military service during the reign of Queen Anne (1702–1714), but Dalton’s English Army Lists do not confirm this. They do, however, tell us that a Donald Maclean was commissioned on December 16th, 1695, as Ensign to Major Duncan MacKenzie in Colonel Robert Mackay’s Regiment of Foot, which was disbanded on November 30th, 1697 (vol. IV, p. 105). In 1696 Donald Maclean is listed as an Ensign in Colonel George McGill’s Regiment of Foot (disbanded in December, 1697), of which Major Duncan MacKenzie was also a member (vol. IV, p. 150). Whether or not this was Dòmhnall of Brolas, I have found nothing to confirm that he was wounded, or even that he saw active service during this period.

Dòmhnall of Brolas served as lieutenant-colonel of the

[TD 253]

Macleans at the Battle of Sheriffmuir (stt. 2-4), where they were led by Sir Iain and took part in the rout of the Hanoverian left wing, and there “he received two severe wounds in the head” (“Seneachie”, p. 228). In GB2, p. 54, Maclean Sinclair indicates confusion about Dòmhnall’s wounds by implying that it was at Sheriffmuir that “he received two severe wounds on the head from a trooper’s saber”.

The first half of st. 17 looks like another version of the first half of st. 11, and the first half of st. 15 is very like the first half of st. 12; there are also some single lines which are very similar to others. It may therefore be that the poem, as we have it, is imperfect (see note on line 1043 below).


946. Here and in lines 1006 and 1042 HM writes bhur where the context seems to demand ar. Since these two possessive pronouns are often indistinguishable in speech and often confused in manuscripts, including HM, I have substituted ar in these cases, even though HM sometimes writes ar (as in line 1002) and air (lines 996, 999) for the first person plural possessive.

950. The Battle of Sheriffmuir (November 13th, 1715) was indecisive, even though the Macleans’ part in it consisted mainly of a victorious charge, and the effect was the failure of the 1715 Rising. Cf. line 692.

958. The claidheamh solais appears frequently in oral tradition as a prize won by a hero from a giant or ogre (O’Rahilly, Early Irish History, p. 68); but perhaps here there is also a reference to the flaming sword placed at the Garden of Eden (Genesis iii.24).

960. HM has h’att, which might rather represent th’ad, “your hat”.

961. In timchioll the rhyme seems to demand that the first syllable and the following epenthetic vowel are u-sounds (see note on line 129), but this cannot be indicated in the spelling. The -m- is clearly sufficient to round the vowels which surround it.

964. The Hanoverian army at Sheriffmuir was led by Iain Ruadh nan Cath (1680–1743), and Duke of Argyll (on whom see also notes on no. 12).

965. The word e is not in the manuscript. BL substitutes other lines for lines 965-966. The reference is clearly to the Maclean chief, Sir Iain.

970. On slàn, “a challenge”, see Watson, Mary Macleod, p. 154; RIA Contribb. slán II (f).

[TD 254]

976. Here and in line 979 the words given in square brackets are mere suggestions, without authority, to replace blank spaces in HM. The insertion in line 976 is especially questionable because the HM text following the blank space is fo t’ mhais t’ urla. BL has emended these lines differently.

989-990. At the time of his death in 1725 Dòmhnall of Brolas was second in line of succession to the Maclean chiefship, and when the 20th chief, Sir Eachann, died without a son in 1750 he was succeeded by Dòmhnall’s son, Sir Ailean. Dòmhnall’s grandfather was a son of Eachann Òg, 14th chief, and younger brother of Eachann Mór, 15th, and Sir Lachlann, 16th. Since the 20th chief spent most of his life abroad, it is likely that Dòmhnall was given, in large measure, the deference due to a chief: this, at any rate, seems to be the implication of line 1006 as understood here (see Clan Gillean, pp. 236-246, 252-253).

994. I have failed to understand the significance of this line.

996. A similar use of stoirm occurs in the poem given here in Appendix V, line 5.

1001. On the wheel of fortune see note on line 1132.

1007. HM has labharach here, and perhaps we ought to read A thì tha labharach àrd.

1027. Iain Mac Ailein, lamenting the death of Sir Iain of Duart in 1716, says (HM, p. 36, st. 5; BL, p. 118):

<gai>bha dharde nar giubhsaich ’s nach dthugadh cach puic dhibh.<eng>

1028. HM has thanaig i Cass and the line seems to be a version of line 1010. I have understood i as an indefinite subject referring to the weather, as in expressions like tha i fuar. Cf. line 1413, note.

1034. According to BL (p. 220) the Innis here is Inchkenneth, off the west coast of Mull, where Dòmhnall was buried. This island, long known as a burial place (cf. Chapman, Johnson’s Journey, p. 131), later became the home of Dòmhnall’s son, Sir Ailean, 21st chief of the Macleans (Clan Gillean, p. 469).

1035. In HM some letters are blotted out following the first word, Ata, and at the end of the blot the letters -ra are clear. Since it is possible that Maclean Sinclair, using the original manuscript of HM, could decipher the letters blotted out, I have here followed BL in inserting ’m fear, and understanding the -a of -ra as the relative particle.

1036. HM has o Diuca, for which we might read o Dhiùca. Perhaps the poet is saying that Dòmhnall earned the respect of

[TD 255]

the Duke of Argyll despite the fact that the two were presumably opponents in many respects.

1043. This line is identical with line 947, and it may be that in lines 1043-1045 we have a form of dùnadh, the old poetic ornament in which the end of the poem repeats part of the beginning (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, pp. 43-45). On the other hand, since a number of lines in this poem appear, with variations, more than once, as noted above, it is also possible that the HM text is faulty, either being a conflation of two or more different versions or having been taken down from a source who was conflating two or more versions.

1044. In Shaw, Folksongs and Folklore, p. 262, we have the verse:

<gai>
Ann an ciste chaoil, chumhaig
Air a dubhadh ’s a tairneadh.
<eng>

The footnote on dubhadh says: “coffins used to be blackened with blacklead”.


16. GE GRIANACH AN LATHA

This poem is taken from HM, whence it has also been printed in GB2, p. 61, and in BL, p. 222.

Stt 18-20 deal with king William, evidently still living, while line 1095 tells us that king James VII is dead. The poem was therefore probably composed somewhere between September 16th, 1701, when James died, and March 8th, 1702, when William died.

I have failed to discover what bad news (lines 1048, 1050) the poet received to give rise to the poem. One possibility is that he had heard that the 10th Earl of Argyll had been made Duke of Argyll and “Lord Inveraray, Morven and Tiree” (see note on line 1082 below). This might have been seen as a final nail in the coffin of Maclean independence, but we must note that this elevation occurred on June 23rd, 1701, before king James’ death (Dickson, Red John, p. 26).

Another possibility is that the poet had heard of the Act of Settlement passed by the English parliament, decreeing that the British throne, on the death of Queen (then Princess) Anne, should pass to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her descendants, and not to the Stuarts (Ferguson, Scotland, p. 36): but this Act received the royal assent on June 12th, 1701, before James’ death.

[TD 256]

Whatever the bad news was, stt. 24, 28 and perhaps 39 indicate that Sir Iain, the chief, was the principal victim concerned. He was in exile at the time (st. 26), having gone to France in 1692 or 1693 to join James VII in exile, and he seems not to have returned before 1704 (Clan Gillean, p. 225; Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 249).


1046. The poet must have known the poem beginning Ach ge grianach an latha composed on the death of Eachann Ruadh, 17th chief, in 1651 and printed in E, p. 232, BL, p. 266. This line may be even older than 1651, see Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs II, p. 195; TGSI XLI, p. 20; Gillies’ Collection, p. 298.

1053-1054. In these lines we are probably dealing with a literary device rather than with evidence that Maighstir Seathan could play the fiddle and the harp. In a lament, ascribed to a “Bard Earanach”, on the death of Iain Molach, and MacKenzie of Applecross, which occurred at some time during the 1680s, we find the following lines (National Library MS 3781, p. 9; cf. Mackechnie, Catalogue I, p. 320):

<gai>
’S ann an earrach na càisge
Bhuail gearainn gu brach mi
A chuir tosd air mo chlàrsaich
Mu fhear baile na fàilte.
<eng>

The following lines are quoted in Carm. Gad. II, p. 251:

<gai>
Chan eil teud am chlarsaich,
Bho ’n a dh’fhag mo run mi.
<eng>

In Ó Rathile’s Dánta Grádha, no. 36, the woman has stolen, not only the poet’s heart, but also his ability to play the harp (line 10).

It may thus be that inability on the part of the poet to produce music is used figuratively as an expression of grief; this seems to be the case in Watson, Mary Macleod, line 203. Cf. Meek, Campbell Collection, no. 312.

1056. Ga mhiread is understood here to be an extended use of the idiom discussed in the note on line 669. A more literal translation might be: “like a little stream, however high in spate”. Cf. BG, line 1425.

1061-1066. Compare the following lines in a version (Macdonald Collection, p. 341) of a 17th-century song:

[TD 257]

<gai>
’S ogha mise do ’n aosdàna,
Bheannaich an long bhàn air tùs.

1067. For the apple-tree used as a figure of the Maclean family see also lines 504, 736-739 and 1029-1033.

1070. Gill-Eathain na Tuaighe was the progenitor and eponym of the Macleans, and is said to have lived in the 13th century (Clan Gillean, p. 40).

1074. HM seems to have a nuaar, and I follow GB2 here in reading an uachdar.

1082. Gilleasbuig Fionn (d. 1703), son of the 9th Earl of Argyll (who had obtained control of the Maclean estates in 1680, see notes on no. 10), was honoured on June 23rd, 1701, by king William by being made the first Duke of Argyll, and “Lord Inveraray, Morven and Tiree” (Dickson, Red John, p. 26; cf. “Seneachie”, History, p. 202).

1085-1087. Sir Lachlann of Duart, 16th chief (d. 1649), had fought at Inverlochy and Kilsyth in 1645 under the Marquis of Montrose (see note on line 152).

1088-1090. Sir Eachann, 17th chief, died leading the Macleans in defeat at Inverkeithing in 1651 (see notes on no. 6).

In line 1090 HM has na chasgradh, here understood as ’n do chasgradh; but na might also be a word for “when” (see note on line 1133 below).

1091-1093. HM (p. 73) has the following footnote on line 1093: “Eachin na n imbristen (?) mharaidh an a Flowdon hill dion a rìgh o saighdin no sasonich.” This was Eachann Odhar (cf. GB2, p. 66), 9th chief of the Macleans, who is called “Eachin oir ni nimbristin” in the 1716 history of the Macleans in Macfarlane’s Genealogical Collections I, p. 127. This account goes on to say: “He was killed at the Battle of Flowdon Hill September 9th 1513. ’Tis said of him That seeing the King in imminent Danger from the English Archers he interposed himself and received in his Body the Arrows levelled at his Majesty, so dyed bravely by his own Body shielding that of his Sovereign’s.” Maclean Sinclair (Clan Gillean, p. 69) calls this chief “Eachann Odhar nan Imreasan”.

An earlier account of the Battle of Flodden (in which the king, James IV, was killed) gives a very different account of Eachann Odhar’s part in it. Lindesay of Pitscottie (Historie, vol. I, pp.

[TD 258]

274-276) tells us that the Maclean chief was late for the battle and was attacked by an overwhelming English force under Lord Howard. He fought “ane gret battell” against the English archers and managed to defeat them, though at the cost of nearly all his men. This account indicates that he escaped with his life.

Since Pitscottie was writing in the 16th century, we might well speculate that his account is more accurate than that of the 1716 manuscript. We might further speculate that the chief’s prowess in battle had earned him a title like “Eachann nan dian-chath”; that, because dian and dìon are virtually identical in pronunciation in many dialects, this came to be understood as “Eachann nan dìon-chath”; and that the tradition given in the 1716 account and in the poem here (note especially dìdean in line 1092) was developed in order to explain this name.

1097-1102. William III, Prince of Orange, was born in The Hague in 1650, the son of William II, Prince of Orange. His mother was Mary Stuart, eldest daughter of king Charles I and sister of James VII, and she was married to William II of Orange in London in 1642, at the age of nine (van der Zee, William and Mary, pp. 1, 2, 10). William III became king of Scotland and England in 1689, as William II (and III), with the “moral support” of the Pope, Innocent XI (ibid., p. 241). This last fact, which tended to be forgotten by many Williamites, makes a somewhat unusual motive for Jacobitism.

1103. HM has “’Snach ban do na bu shilesribh”, and I can see no alternative to emending this. BL emends to “Cha b’ ann idir d’ a shinnsribh”.

1108. Fearghas Mór Mac Earca, who set up the kingdom of Dál Riada about A.D. 500, was believed to be an ancestor of the royal house of Stuart (Menzies, Who are the Scots?, pp. 66-67).

1109. On the traditional history alluded to in this stanza see note on line 1166. In this case it seems likely that the poet’s reference is to the (? Lowland) Scots version of this tradition, in which the sons of Míl are replaced by Sìoman Breac as the coloniser of Ireland (Bellenden, Boece, vol. I, pp. 28-29; Matthews, “Egyptians in Scotland”, pp. 291-292).

In the Middle Irish account (Macalister, Lebor Gabála V, p. 252; cf. RC, pp. 148, 308; Keating, Foras Feasa II, p. 140) Siomón Brecc is one of a long list of kings of Ireland supposed to have reigned between the coming of the sons of Míl and historical times, but he has no place of special importance in the list. Keating, however (Foras Feasa I, pp. 184, 188 ff.; cf. BL, p. 133),

[TD 259]

lists a Simeon Breac, son of Starn, son of Neimheadh, who is said to be the ancestor of the Fir BoIg, who made the third invasion of Ireland; in Lebor Gabála (III, pp. 144 ff.) he is not described as “Breac”. Either of these individuals, perhaps, may be the basis of the Lowland Scots “Symon Brek”, who may be alluded to here.

1110-1111. Gaidheal Glas, the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels, was held to have lived in Egypt; see further the note on line 1166. HM has na Ghabhil ghlas here, and we are probably to understand the article before his name, as in line 1166.

1119. HM has chion bhi seasabh lead, and I have supplied what I take to be a missing word. BL reads le durachd.

1120. On the function of seo here and in lines 1117 and 1165 see note on line 488.

1127. The reference may be to one or other of the groups involved, at the turn of the 18th century, in the dispute about the political future of Scotland: some had long favoured Union with England, which king William favoured, while others, especially Jacobites, were antagonistic to the king and the Union (Ferguson, Scotland, pp. 34-35). Sir Iain may be presumed to have opposed the king in this matter, but it is hard to be sure which side of the dispute is referred to here.

1129. The translation of ball as “ball” I owe to Professor Thomson, who suggests that we may have a metaphorical usage similar to that of cuidheall in line 1132, with the ball representing, perhaps, something like “position of control”, a meaning extended from “control of the ball” in a game. Compare the English expression “the ball is in your court” (i.e. “it is up to you to make the next move”).

1130-1131. Compare the following lines in Iain Mac Ailein’s poem on Sir Iain’s absence (Turner’s Collection, p. 111; BL, p. 113):

<gai>
A Rìgh nan dùl tha gun tùs gun fhinid,
A nì réir t’àilleas neach àrd is ìosal.
<eng>

The reference is presumably to the New Testament, e.g. Matt. xxiii.l2.

1132. The wheel of fortune (also in line 1001 here) appears in a poem of 1649, and in another of 1660, by Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines 635, 910) and is a commonplace in the poetry of the 18th century and later. It has been suggested (Campbell, Highland Songs, p. 3, n. 2) that it may have classical antecedents.

[TD 260]

1133. HM reads Na fauth a chuill a tiontadh, and Na bha is a highly questionable interpretation of Na fauth. Na is known in the meaning “when” in Kintyre (e.g. Holmer, Gaelic of Kintyre, p. 90, and p. 120, text 19; cf. SGS X, p. 123) and Arran (Holmer, Gaelic of Arran, p. 142), but I have no evidence that it was known in Mull; it does not occur elsewhere in the poems here edited, apart from the possible instance in line 1090 (see note above). BL reads “Nuair a bha i a tionndadh”.

1135. Perhaps “marsh” or the like would be a more acceptable meaning for lón (lòn in HM), since Dwelly marks the meaning “mud” obsolete. But C. M. Robertson tells us (An Deo-Ghréine I, p. 197) that “Lòn goes through all the gradations of meaning, mud, morass, marsh, meadow, lawn, and in certain districts also means a sluggish brook such as often flows through marshy ground” (cf. BG, p. 375; Scottish Studies 2, p. 196).

1139-1140. Maclean Sinclair tells us (BL, p. 226) that the reference here is to the deaths of Lachlann (born c. 1650), 2nd of Brolas, who died in 1686; Lachlann, 3rd of Torloisk, who died in 1687; and Lachlann, 10th of Coll (the subject of no. 8 here), who was drowned in August, 1687. These three are also lamented in a poem by Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn (BL, p. 56). Lachlann of Brolas and Lachlann of Torloisk had acted as tutors to Sir Iain (born 1670) during part of his minority, and Sir Iain assumed control of his estates on the death of the latter (Clan Gillean, pp. 202, 218).

1144. Fòd is understood here to mean “land, country”, a meaning attested by Macalpine in a Mull song: o’n thàinig e do’n fhòd, “since he came to the country”. Note also Dwelly’s instance: tha e nis air f. na fìrinne, “he is now on the sod of truth—dead”.

1147. HM reads Stric a sìlle a n chruinichabh por. Sìlle does not appear in modern dictionaries, but possibly it is a development of the Early Modern sílne, a derivative of síol, “seed” (RIA Contribb.). Sílne can be used of the seed of plants (ibid.) and it is assumed in the translation that it has the meaning of sìlean, another derivative of sìol, “the worst part of grain” (Dwelly). BL substitutes sìlean here.

1150. HM has falliun is smeoir, for which Maclean Sinclair writes faillean is meoir in the manuscript; this emendation is followed here and in GB2 and BL.

1153. The use of the verb crathadh here may owe something to the following Biblical passage (Haggai ii.5-7):

[TD 261]

A réir an fhocail a dhaingnich mi ruibh ’nuair a thàinig sibh a mach as an Eiphit … Fathasd aon uair, ann a ùine bhig, crathaidh mise na nèamhan, agus an talamh, agus an fhairge, agus am fearann tioram: Agus crathaidh mi na h-uile chinnich, agus thig miann nan uile chinneach; agus lìonaidh mi an tigh so le glòir, deir Tighearn nan sluagh.

1155. If the text here is correct (HM has a mhur lionta sin traitha) the line looks like an Anglicism, if not a Latinism.

1159. Mu chiadoir (mo chetar in HM) seems to be a survival of Old Irish fo chétóir, “at once, forthwith, immediately”. Compare the form a’ cheud òir in Campbell, Leabhar na Feinne, p. 108, st. 1, and p. 109, st. 1.

1161. HM has an tuiribh sa n tairsts, and the interpretation here is no more than a guess. BL emends to Tha sinn muladach saraicht’.

1162. HM has aithibh, which I take to be the dative plural of àdha, “liver”. Here and in line 1333 BL substitutes plural forms of àra, “kidney”, no doubt because of the fact that the body has only one liver. Nevertheless it is probably relevant that words for “liver” are normally plural in Irish (Wagner, Linguistic Atlas, map 139).


17. RAINN

The text is that of AB, where the poem appears on the 7th page of the Preface. Other extant versions are derived from AB (see Sources and Readings): these appear in HM, in Pattison’s Gaelic Bards, p. 199 (which includes a rhythmical English translation); in GB2, p. 58, and BL, p. 226; and in BG, p. 155.

On the reasons for the composition of the poem see notes on no. 13; there reasons are also given for dating it to c. 1705, and for printing the text here exactly as it stands in AB. In the case of the present poem there is additional justification for leaving the text untouched in the fact that an edited version is easily available in BG.

As is pointed out in Macdonald, Poems of Alexander Macdonald, p. iv, and in SGS VI, p. 29, Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair’s poem Moladh an úghdair do ’n tsean chánoin Ghailic (Ais-eiridh, 1751, p. 1) is clearly influenced by the present poem in style and in metre.

[TD 262]

1166-1167. In the pseudo-history of the Gaels drawn up by learned men between the 8th and 11th centuries, using old mythological tales and a large proportion of simple invention, Gaedheal Glas was the ancestor of all the Gaels. He was the son of Scota, daughter of Pharaoh (cf. line 129), and lived in Egypt at the time when the Israelites escaped by crossing the Red Sea (Exodus xiv). He was called Glas because of a wound received from a poisonous snake, and was cured by Moses (Macalister, Lebor Gabála II, pp. 52, 58-60). Seventeen generations later the descendants of Gaedheal Glas conquered Spain (ibid., p. 76). Two generations after this they came to Ireland (ibid., vol. V, pp. 20 ff.), their leaders being the sons of Míl, or Míl Easpáine (ibid., p. 24; RC, pp. 308-309).

This traditional history, as relayed in the Lowland Scots context (e.g. Bellenden, Boece, vol. I, pp. 21-30), had some political importance in Scotland between the 13th century and 1603 (Matthews, “Egyptians in Scotland”), and perhaps again for a short period after 1707 (op. cit., p. 306).

Míl is sometimes referred to in Lebor Gabála as Mílid (e.g. vol. V, pp. 22, 24), which gives the poet’s form here—perhaps the most common form at this period (cf. Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 27; Mackenzie, Iain Lom, lines 1210, 1430). The name Mìl (Middle Irish accusative and dative Mílid, genitive Míled) is identical with the common noun míl, “soldier” (modern Scottish Gaelic mìlidh, as in BG, lines 1309, 4512); see O’Rahilly, Early Irish History, p. 195. It is possible that the poet here has the common noun in mind to some extent when he makes the word plural (na Míligh being equivalent to modern nam Mìlidh); see also Matheson, MacCodrum, p. 272, n. 1385. The similar use of the article with Gáoidheal here and in lines 1110 (see note) and 1196 may indicate that the poet viewed this word too as more than a proper name.

1169. Fil’gheachd (Classical Gaelic filidheacht) is apparently to be read here as disyllabic (cf. note on line 893).

1170. A bhos is tháll: i.e., probably, in Scotland and in Ireland.

1174. The sons of Míl are said to have reached Ireland in the time of king David in Israel (Macalister, Lebor Gabála V, p. 152). The 17th-century compilers of the “Annals of the Four Masters” estimated the date as 1700 B.C. (see O’Rahilly, Early Irish History, p. 194 n.), and the Book of Clanranald (RC, p. 149) agrees. The “court of kings” here probably represents all the

[TD 263]

courts of Gaelic-speaking kings from this traditional date down to either the appearance of the English language in Britain (5th century A.D.) or its adoption as the Scottish court language (c. 1100) in either case, treall is clearly a very loose term.

1175. Here and in line 1187, I have accepted Watson’s judgment (BG, pp. 304, 362) that Dubhghall meant “Lowlander” and/or “Saxon”, as contrasted with Gall (line 1187), which meant, he says, one of “the Gaelicised Norse of the Hebrides, etc.” The reference in line 1174 to the royal court, if it includes the Scottish royal court, would bear out his interpretation of Dubhghall, as do the occurrences of the word in Iain Dubh’s Òran nam Fineachan Gaidhealach (BG, lines 4104, 4176), in Moladh Cabar Féidh (Turner’s Collection, p. 24, line 5; SO, p. 360) and in a poem by Uilleam Ros (Calder ed., p. 80, line 38). The word is also used, ambiguously, in a poem, probably of the 1690s, by Iain Mac Ailein (Turner, p. 109, line 3; BL, p. 111), which has also been ascribed to Maighstir Seathan (see Introduction, Section 6).

In Classical Gaelic Dubhghall most often meant “Dane”, as opposed to Fionnghall, “Norwegian” (see RIA Contribb. s.v. dub), but in the Book of Clanranald this distinction seems to be made with Lochlannach and Fionnghall (RC, p. 154).

1176-1177. In the early Gaelic social system the file (filidh), bard, léigh (líaig, lighiche), draoi and seanchaidh were all members of the aos dána, the class of learned men and craftsmen. Aoisdàn here has clearly acquired the narrower Scottish meaning discussed in the Introduction, Section 2.

The druineach, as “needlewoman, embroideress”, may also have been a member of the aos dána, on a lower level (see RIA Contribb. s.v. druinech). In the present context, however, the meaning “needlewoman, embroideress” seems unlikely, and probably the poet intends the meaning given in the “Irish–English Dictionary” in AB: “Druinneach, an artist” (cf. also Carm. Gad. II, p. 270: draoineach, “sculptor”). The poet must have known of the old graveyard in Iona which was called Cladh nan Druineach, traditionally “supposed to have been the burial place of the Druids” (Pennant, Tour, 1774, vol. I, p. 245); Iona itself is said (McNeill, Iona, p. 76) to have been known as Innis nan Druineach. Possibly the occurrence of the rare word druineach, “needlewoman, embroideress”, in a place-name has led to its erroneous interpretation as “artist” or even “druid”. However, since the word derives from Old Irish druine, “skill in

[TD 264]

craftsmanship; manual dexterity; handiwork” (RIA Contribb.), it may well be that druineach survived in Scotland with meanings, like “artist”, which are not attested in early literature. See also Dwelly, s.v. druineach.

Druithnich here looks like a plural, but the context shows that it is singular; possibly the poet is using an alternative form druiniche, but I have not seen this elsewhere. BL reads Drùibhnich.

1178. Gathelus is a common Latinised form of the name Gaedheal (Glas), attested in Scotland at least as early as the 16th century (Bellenden, Boece I, p. 23), though the form Gadelos appears much earlier in a Lowland Scots poem (Matthews, “Egyptians”, p. 295, line 2). The form Gaidelus is already attested c. 1185 in the writings of Giraldus Cambrensis (Dimock, Opera, vol. V, p. 147).

Eighpht is monosyllabic, as it can be in 18th-century Irish (Dinneen Éipht), though names for Egypt are normally disyllabic.

There is no suggestion in Lebor Gabála that Gaedheal himself left Egypt, but early Scottish historians held that he (and Scota) came to Spain (Skene, Chronicles, p. 380; Bellenden, Boece I, p. 23; Matthews, “Egyptians”, p. 291). Keating, writing in the mid-17th century (Foras Feasa II, p. 24), points out that Scottish and English writers (he names Boece as one of the offenders) are in error on this point. Therefore, as line 1109 also indicates, Maighstir Seathan’s information on Gaelic pseudo-history, even if it was all gained from John Beaton (this is highly unlikely, cf. Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, pp. 25-26), must ultimately derive partly from Lowland sources.

I180. Diagh’re, for diadhaire, is clearly intended as a plural. Perhaps the poet thought of the singular as diadhair, which Dwelly attests.

1182. Inse (Inis) Fáil is a common name for Ireland in Classical poetry (RIA Contribb. s.v. 5 fál).

1183. Saint Colum (Calum Cille) was also patron of the poet’s own parish of Kilmore, earlier known as “Kilcholumkill” (Scott, Fasti 4, p. 114).

1184-1185. The poet was doubtless aware of the tradition that a particular block of stone in Iona marked the grave of a king of France who had abdicated his throne (Trenholme, Story of Iona, p. 144; Pennant, Tour, 1774, I, p. 251; cf. J. P. Maclean, Clan MacLean, p. 319). These lines may indicate that the tradi-

[TD 265]

tion also saw the king as having come to Iona to be educated.

1187. If Dubhghall means something like “English-speaker” (see note on line 1175 above), the poet may here be thinking of Oswald, king of Northumbria, who, in the 7th century, was probably baptised at Iona and learned to speak Gaelic (Menzies, Who are the Scots?, p. 96). In the 10th century Amhlaoibh, king of the “Gaill” of Dublin, came to Iona, where he died “after penance and a good life” (Trenholme, Story of Iona, p. 75). Pennant (Tour, 1790, I, p. 284) quotes the historians Munro and Buchanan as saying that eight Norwegian princes are buried in Iona (cf. Sacheverell, Account of the Isle of Man, p. 102), though J. P. Maclean (Clan MacLean, p. 319) settles for three. But I have seen no evidence of a practice, on the part of English-speakers or Norsemen (or the French), of sending their children to Iona to be educated.

For an tiulsa ’nclonn BG reads an t-iùl ’s a nclann. Accepting this hesitantly, the translation here understands iùl as a variant of eòl, which can mean “that which is known or familiar, esp. of places, accustomed surroundings, home” (RIA Contribb.). Iùl is then taken, without authority, to be extended to denote the inhabitants of the lands controlled by Anglo-Saxon and Norse leaders. The use of the article with iùl, however, contrasted with the possessive used with clann, makes this interpretation highly questionable.

Pattison reads: Chuir Gaill a’s Dubh-ghaill chum an iùil so ’n clann.

1190. Watson, perhaps understanding as an tùr, suggests (BG, p. 304) that the reference here is to the Tower of Babel (Genesis xi), and that the meaning is that Gaelic has fallen from its place among the languages. HM emends to san ùir.

1191. Watson (BG, line 4203) may be right is substituting a comma for the full stop at the end of the line, and (presumably) interpreting the iád of line 1192 as being na Flaith’ in this line. Here iád and (in line 1193) leo are taken as having unspecified referents, and representing a colloquial impersonal expression like thog iad taigh, “a house was built”. The use of the word spéis in connection with na Flaith’ seems to make it unlikely that these “princes” would be guilty of the charges in lines 1192-1193.

1193. For le hair all the other sources have substituted le tàir, which is accepted in the translation here also. Perhaps the h- is a misprint.

[TD 266]

1194. On O Líath for Lhuyd see note on line 892.

1198. The Scots were believed to have been named not only after Scota Aegyptica, daughter of Pharaoh and mother of Gaedheal Glas (see note on line 1166 above), but also after Éber Scot, great-grandson of Gaedheal (Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, pp. 25-29; Macalister, Lebor Gabála II, p. 66). Míl is also held to have been married to a Scota, whose previous husband had been named Scot (Macalister, Lebor Gabála II, p. 40), and these names too are presumably intended to provide origins for the name of the Scots. A 17th-century poem in BG refers to cinneadh Scuit agus Mhìlidh (line 4496).

1199. Gu níocfad is understood here to represent Classical Gaelic go n-íocfadh (3rd person singular conditional of the verb íoc, “pay”), its subjects being the gach neach, gach droing and gach aoin of lines 1196-1198; the loss of the -h implied by this interpretation is discussed in the note on line 892. Watson, however (BG, p. 304), treats íocfad simply as an error for íocfaidís, 3rd person plural conditional. The translation is not affected in any case.

1200. Queen Anne reigned from 1702 till 1714.

1201. I have taken nochd to be the adjective, “naked”, but it might perhaps be for a nochd, “tonight”. Do naite is understood to contain the verb “to be” (is) in a form not uncommon in Scotland, do’n being perhaps related to Old Irish forms like diant, diandid (Thurneysen, Grammar, par. 798; RIA Contribb., I, col. 308, lines 56 ff.).

1202. Na ncéud an ál (’cédan àll in HM) may represent nan ceudan àl, àl being a word for “brood” or “generation” (Dwelly); or possibly nan ceud a nall, but in this case linn nan ceud offers difficulties of interpretation.

1208-1209. In Exodus xxxi the Lord tells Moses that He has appointed Beseleel and Ahaliab to make the tabernacle for the Ark of the Covenant.

1210. One might have expected a form like Ó Léith here, to provide the rhyme with téid. Pattison emends to a ghluais O Luid ’s a ghleus.

1211. In ler dtug le the second le is taken here to represent lé, the 3rd person singular form of the preposition le, referring, as does the le in ler, to the feminine word tuigse. Such duplication of the preposition in relative clauses of this kind is not uncommon in Classical Gaelic, e.g., with the preposition ag, Bergin, Stories from Keating, p. 13, no. 6, lines 2-3: an ceirt-bhreitheamh

[TD 267]

agá raibhe an Iodh Morainn aige; ibid., p. 22, lines 47-48: ar dtoidheacht do láthair don leanbh ón muicidhe agá raibhe i gcoimhéad aige. Here, then, the subject of the verb tug is contained in the verb itself, as is normal in Classical Gaelic.

However, Watson (BG, line 4223) may be right in (apparently) taking the second le as a misprint, and substituting sé, as the subject of tug.

HM has leir ’ndugt an ceimsa trid, which gives a better rhyme with Luíd in line 1210, but which otherwise makes little sense.

1217. Perhaps beannachd is to be understood here as “a salutation”, and synonymous with fàilte; but perhaps “blessing” is more likely in a poem written by a clergyman.


18. ÒRAN D’A LEANNAN

This poem is taken from S, p. 114, and has been printed from there in GB2, p. 55, and in BL, p. 229.

The opening line may imply that the poem was composed after a period during which the poet produced no poetry. It seems quite possible that nos. 16 and 17 (composed in 1701–1702 and c. 1705 respectively) belong to the earlier period, and that the present poem opens a new period which includes also no. 20, composed in 1753, and perhaps no. 19. Lines 1220-1231 may well refer to the kind of cultural nationalism expressed in nos. 16 and 17, which the poet now regrets: on a possible change in his political views see Introduction, Section 6. We must, of course, allow for the likelihood that some poems have been lost from both these postulated periods. If the word dàn in line 1218 is used in its strict sense, denoting poetry in a syllabic metre (like the present poem), we have no extant poem by Maighstir Seathan to which he might be referring; but dàn may be used here simply for “poetry”.

It is possible that the subject of the poem, “Nighean Dhòmhnaill o Chùil nan Sonn” (line 1308), is the same person as the Anna nighean Dòmhnaill of line 1374, the subject of no. 19, whom JM, in the title to no. 19, identifies as a Maclean. However, there are good reasons to doubt the ascription of no. 19 to Maighstir Seathan (see Notes), and we therefore have no reliable information, apart from line 1308, on the identity of the subject of the present poem. But line 1257 tempts one to suggest that her name was Fionnghal.

[TD 268]

Maighstir Seathan is said to have been born about 1680; he was married in 1705, his wife died in 1753, and he himself died in 1756 (see Introduction, Section 6). The general tone of the poem, especially stt. 13-15, is somewhat paternal and didactic, and strikes me as being consistent with composition as a “present” (line 1311) for a much younger woman after the poet’s marriage. Taking note of the defence offered in st. 6, and of the tradition of love poetry as exemplified in no. 14 here and elsewhere, it seems fair to suggest that the poem could have been composed at any time between, say, 1720 and the poet’s death in 1756; and further, that the word leannan in the title does not imply that the poet was in any way unfaithful to his wife.

References in the following notes to Ó Rathile’s Dánta Grádha (DG) I owe to Miss Helen O’Sullivan. This poem, however, depending perhaps on its date, may be much closer than no. 14 to the cultural milieu of 18th-century love poetry, as exemplified in the works of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, Uilleam Ros and Donnchadh Bàn; this poetry makes use of many of the ideas found in DG.


1221. Seal mun is here, and in lines 194 and 1242, translated simply as “before” because, as R. L. Thomson suggests (Adtimchiol an Chreidimh, p. 132), it is the equivalent of the word sul, sol or suil which means “before” in Classical Gaelic (Thomson, Foirm na N-Urrnuidheadh, pp. 152, 235; Adtimchiol, p. 207). This word had the alternative form sul fo before the end of the Middle Irish period (RIA Contribb. s.v. sul), and survives in modern Irish in a variety of forms, including sul má, which usually cause eclipsis of the initial of the following verb (Wagner, Linguistic Atlas, vol. I, map 121). The element following sul in Irish is thus likely to be identical in origin with the mu or mun in Scottish seal mu(n).

R. A. Breatnach (Ériu XVII, pp. 100 ff.), listing many of the attested forms, suggests that they derive from siul, an old dative form of sel (modern seal), “a (period of) time”. The form seal mu(n) seems to be largely confined to the Scottish vernacular verse of the 17th century and later, and by that time the word seal in this group may already have been open to interpretation simply as the noun for “a (period of) time”: if Breatnach is right, the word simply reverted to its original meaning; if not, the original word which gave forms like sul has been assimilated to the noun seal. Seal mu(n) was therefore felt to mean “a while

[TD 269]

before”, and the word for “before” thus came to be mu(n). A somewhat similar development occurred in the Irish of Co. Waterford (Ériu XVII, p. 104, n. 7).

Just as early as we find uses of seal mu(n) meaning, evidently, “before”, we also find uses of mu(n) alone for this meaning: it may be that seal mu(n) tends to survive beside mu(n) into 17th-century poetry largely because it provides an extra syllable. Seal mu(n) is used, for instance, by Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., lines 506, 1310, 1833), Donnchadh nam Pìos (Mac Phàrlain, Lamh-Sgrìobhainn, p. 110, st. 25: Shaill ma deijd), Alasdair Mac Ùisdein (ibid., p. 98, st. 6: Shaill von choisnimb) and Iain Mac Ailein (c. 1700; S, p. 240, line 8), as well as Eachann Bacach (line 194 here), and can still be found in poetry at least as late as the end of the 18th century (e.g. Sinton, Poetry of Badenoch, p. 188, st. 3; p. 269, st. 4). And we find the line “Seal mu’n taine Mac De” in a Kintail poem in Carm. Gad. II, p. 172, line 9. Yet Iain Lom was already using mun alone in the same sense before 1650 (Mackenzie ed., lines 92, 336, 422), and in the prose in the Book of Clanranald (RC II, p. 188, line 7) the form ma is used.

It remains possible, of course, that in some cases seal mu(n) may mean “a while before”, but this meaning seems unlikely in any of the contexts here.

1228. GB2 and BL omit Tha here, presumably because it seems ungrammatical and hypermetrical.

1233. See note on line 898. The word òr-fholt is used in DG no. 25.12, and the word réidh is used of hair in no. 100.26.

1243. Words for “branches” or “saplings” are usually applied in poetry to male heroes, but in DG no. 102.6 (cf. also no. 64.22) the woman is called géag.

1245. The use of cnò, “nut”, of a woman does not occur in DG, but Muireadhach Albanach in the 13th century uses it in reference to his wife (Bergin, Irish Bardic Poetry, p. 102, st. 12); it is commonly used of male heroes in Classical poetry (e.g. Watson, Scottish Verse, line 605).

1247-1249. The beauty of the eyes is frequently praised in DG. The eyes may be compared with a plant (no. 101.26) or with dew (no. 100.18; cf. Craig, Òrain Luaidh, p. 120, line 19), but there is no instance in DG of a comparison with dew-covered plants, as here and in line 1329. Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Poems, p. 212) calls Mòrag’s eye “sùil mar ghorm-dhearc driùchd”.

Here it may be that eadar is intended not to mean “between”,

[TD 270]

but to have the sense of “both”: “which both her neck and her eye have”.

1250-1251. The beauty of the neck is praised in DG nos. 1.14, 24.10; the beauty of the palm of the hand in nos. 11.26, 26.14. On the foot see note on line 922. The whiteness of the teeth is praised in DG nos. 1.8, 17.17, and commonly in Classical praise-poetry to male subjects (e.g. Watson Scottish Verse, line 259). Whiteness of the teeth, skin and neck are also praised in a waulking song in Craig, Òrain Luaidh, p. 59, lines 7-10. Cf. Ó Tuama, An Grá, pp. 126, 128.

1252-1253. In DG the whiteness of the body or skin (nos. 5.33-34, 29.7) is compared with various things, but not with bog-cotton, which is a more common simile in Scottish vernacular poetry (e.g. line 426 here; Macdonald, Poems, p. 224, line 1; Macleod, Duncan Ban, line 1733).

1254-1255. See notes on lines 898 and 899.

1256. The brow is praised in DG nos. 65.13, 99.17, and is frequently described as caol (nos. 24.7, 65.13, 98.10).

1257. Perhaps rosg is to be translated rather as “eye”, which is the meaning it usually has in DG; cf. note on line 1247 above.

1258. The redness of the lips is praised in DG nos. 1.7, 99.6, and compared with the rose in no. 30.33. Cf. Ó Tuama, An Grá, p. 127.

1260. Cf. note on line 912. The idea of giving up the world’s wealth for the loved one’s attention appears also in DG no. 59.28, and similar renunciations are made in nos. 15.27-28, 32.3-4.

1263. Emphasis on the loved one’s good sense or disposition (as also in line 906) does not appear in DG, but occurs, for example, in Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair’s Moladh Mòraig (Ais-eiridh, p. 11).

1268. It would seem unreasonable to doubt that Maighstir Seathan knew the poem Is mairg do-ní uaille as óige, published about 1630 in Adtimchiol an Chreidimh (Thomson ed., p. 217) and there ascribed to Athairne Mac Éoghain.

Similar warnings against pride in youth and beauty, and urgings to turn to God, may be found in DG nos. 98, 102, 105 and 106.

1280-1281. Evidently the suitors of nighean Dhòmhnaill included some (or one) named Cameron and some named Campbell. Maclean Sinclair (BL p. 231) deduces that she probably married one of these.

1300. Ni here and in line 1306 represents the Classical Gaelic negative ní. For a recent discussion of its frequent occurrence in

[TD 271]

Scottish literature in forms like ni’n see Ériu XXVIII, pp. 100 ff.

1308. The capitals in the place-name are in S, but I cannot locate any place so named. Possibly the place-name is simply Cùil, with nan sonn used here adjectivally, but I still cannot identify the place. If we could be sure that nighean Dhòmhnaill was a Maclean, we might suggest a relationship with Gill-Eathain Maclean of Coull, a son of Lachlann Mór, 13th of Duart (d. 1598), who is on record in 1618 (see Clan Gillean, p. 251) and 1625 (Giblin, Franciscan Mission, p. 81). It may be his son who is referred to as “Aoighre na Cùladh” in the poem Cumha do Niall Òg (JM, p. 151; GB, p. 22, line 11), which may date from the 1630s; and it may be a later descendant who is referred to in a poem of c. 1680 (JM2, p. 227; cf. BL, p. 59) by Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn as “Oighre na Cùileadh,/Bha bho thùs de shliochd bhràithrean.”

1311. Professor Thomson tells me that preasan is sometimes used, both in poetry and in common speech, specifically to mean “wedding gift”, a meaning attested by Dwelly.


19. ÒRAN GAOIL D’A LEANNAN

This poem is edited principally from JM, but use is also made of the independent versions in MN MS C and MCa, p. 166. The JM version has been published, with emendations, in JM2, p. 179, and part of it also in CC, p. 291, and BL, p. 231.

There is some reason to doubt the ascription of this poem to Maighstir Seathan, an ascription made only in JM and sources deriving from it. The poem differs notably from no. 18 in that it contains none of the paternal tone of that poem. The author had clearly served as a soldier in Flanders (lines 1382-1383), and we have no reason to think that Maighstir Seathan had done so (cf. Introduction, Section 6). If the poem were addressed, as has been thought, to the same person who is addressed in no. 18, and about the same time, lines 1346-1349 might be thought unworthy of a married minister of the Church.

It may therefore be that this poem is the work of an anonymous ex-soldier and that, because its subject is named as nighean Dòmhnaill (lines 1374, 1388), it has been ascribed in JM to Maighstir Seathan because he composed a poem (no. 18) also addressed to a “nighean Dòmhnaill” (line 1308).

The poem is left here, nevertheless, because we cannot be absolutely sure that it is not the work of Maighstir Seathan.

[TD 272]

Line 1374, in a stanza which occurs only in JM, names the subject as Anna, and the title in JM2 further identifies her as a Maclean (cf. note on line 1308). But there is not enough information on which to identify her more closely, or to date the poem even approximately.

The title in JM says that the poem is addressed to Anna “agus i posadh ri fear eile”; JM2 alters this to “agus ì air pòsadh fear eile”. Evidence that Anna had in fact married another is hard to find in the poem itself, but perhaps exists in line 1371 (see note below). Maclean Sinclair thought (BL, p. 231) that Anna married a Campbell or a Cameron, but this is an unwarrantable inference from lines 1278-1281.

The poem is similar to the “love-aisling” discussed by Murphy in Éigse I, pp. 40 ff. (cf. also Knott, Tadhg Dall I, pp. lxii-lxiii; Ó Tuama, An Grá, p. 115), where Irish instances are listed: a relevant Scottish instance may be the “Dan Gaoil” in Turner’s Collection, p. 170. But Murphy indicates that the woman seen in the dream is usually a fairy woman, and the present poem, and another by Iain Mór Mac Dhùghaill (d. 1761) in Gillies’ Collection, p. 66 (GB2, p. 140), are distinguished by the fact that the woman is named, and is clearly human.


1318-1319. The poem by Iain Mór Mac Dhùghaill mentioned above has a similar opening:

<gai>
’N ainnir a chunnaic mi ’m chadal,
Cha robh i agam ’nuair dhùisg mi …
<eng>

The woman’s name is Anna in this poem also.

1325. I have understood frasach as a noun, meaning “shower” (Dwelly). But possibly we should read frasachd (“showers”, “showery weather”) with MN.

1330-1331. Perhaps the similarity between these lines and lines 1352-1353 was intended by the poet, for there is a similar similarity in the MCa version. But perhaps there has been faulty transmission of the text, and the original may have been closer to MN, which keeps line 1330 as here but for line 1352 reads: “Tha ’n Sacsa air mo ghiulan”.

1332-1333. The punctuation here may not be correct: JM and JM2 have commas after lines 1330, 1331 and 1332. The semicolon here placed after line 1331 could equally well follow line 1332, as it does in MCa.

On the word àidhean see note on line 1162. Here JM has

[TD 273]

ain, later altered to aithin, but JM2, MN and MCa have àirnean.

1335. Cf. lines 812 and 1018, and Ó Tuama, An Grá, p. 116. Caitrìona Nighean Eòghainn, lamenting the death of her husband, has the lines (JM, p. 321; BL, p. 62):

<gai>
Gur h-e mis tha gu cràiteach
’S nach slànaich an léigh mi.
<eng>

1340-1341. See note on line 914.

1351. This line is taken from MN because the forms of it in JM and MCa do not make complete sense, having no object for their verbs. JM has ’S mi nach diultadh sgun iaradh, and MCa has ’S mi nach diulta, gun iarruidh.

1368. Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Ais-eiridh, p. 95, line 11) uses bhermilion of the redness of lips.

1371. The JM text is quite clear: Led bhacharan tiorram, the mark of length appearing in bhàcharan in JM2 and BL: the long vowel is probably also confirmed by the metre. The only possibility I can see for the word bàcharan is that it is the form listed by Dwelly as an alternative to buacharan, “dried cowdung used for fuel”—the word tioram would seem to confirm this meaning. If the poem was in fact occasioned by its subject’s marriage to another it is possible, as Donald MacAulay suggests to me, that “bàcharan tioram” is a term of rather unchivalrous abuse used of Anna’s husband. The line in MCa, Le tàcharan tinnis, also seems to refer to a despised human being, for tàcharan can mean “sprite”, “weak being”, “orphan” and “cowardly person”, according to Dwelly.

1381. Presumably a reference to James VII (king from 1685 till 1688): his annual income while he was king was well over two million pounds (Haswell, James II, p. 242).

1382. JM has “A nuair a bha mi san olain”, but I have substituted the MN version of the line because “Flaras” there gives the required rhyme with thall in line 1383.

At the end of the poem MCa adds four further lines (see Sources and Readings), which should probably be written as follows:

<gai>
Air faill i rinn, ill i rinn, och i rinn, hó ro laoigh;
’S cruaidh-fhortan gun fhios a chuir mise fo chumha do ghaoil.
<eng>

Since the metre of these lines is different from that of the rest of the poem, it is likely that they do not properly belong to it, but have become attached to it because of their theme. They are clearly a version of the lines used as a chorus in one of Uilleam

[TD 274]

Ros’ love-songs (Calder ed., p. 102), with which they are in metrical agreement; it is perhaps possible that they were also used as a chorus in other songs in the same metre.


20. MARBHRANN D’A MHNAOI, ISIBEAL NIC GILL-EÒIN

This poem is taken from HM and has already been printed from there in CC, p. 211, GB2, p. 66, and BL, p. 233. The title in HM reads Marimh rein Mr Ioin Mac Gilleon … da mhrie Ishibal Nic Ghilleon: it looks as if the first two words in this are due to an omission and that the title intended began “Marbhrann rinn …”

Since the poet was married in 1705 (see Introduction, Section 6), lines 1394-1395 make it virtually certain that his wife died in or around 1753, about three years before his own death, so that we can date the poem to about that year.


1408. Cf. 1 Corinthians xv.55-56.

1413. An cais (in cais in HM) appears as an caise, “in haste”, in Macalpine’s Dictionary, which was based on Islay Gaelic. It may have been Maighstir Seathan himself who gave Edward Lhuyd the expression A ngais, “immediatly”, in AB, p. 427 (cf. Introduction, Section 6).

1422-1425. The punctuation of this verse and the consequent translation represent only one of several interpretations: the word ach must be understood at the beginning of line 1424. Donald MacAulay suggests another interpretation:

<gai>
Cuid eile chùis m’éibhnis mhóir
Nach d’fhaod gum b’e bhith bèo do chàs?—
(Thu) bhith foirfe ’n naomhachd gun spot,
Gun pheacadh gun lochd gu bràch.
<eng>

Here the second line might be translated: “Could it not have been that being alive was your difficulty?”

1433. For chràd HM has chraid. I take the word to be a shortened form of cràdhad, which is attested in the Fernaig manuscript of c. 1690 (in a poem by Alasdair Mac Mhurchaidh, fl. 1609) in a context which suggests that it is equivalent in meaning to cràdh (Mac Phàrlain ed., p. 134, st. 10); cràdh also occurs in line 1417 here. This “shortened” form of cràdhad also appears, as chraid (lenited), in the Fernaig manuscript (ibid., p. 156, no. XLV).

[TD 275]

METRES AND TUNES

I. ’S ANN DI-CIADAIN AN LÀ

Three-line “strophic” metre, common in 17th-century poetry, used here also in nos. 2, 7, 11, 12 and 16 (see BG, pp. 1 ff.; SGS XI, pp. 16 ff.). Two stresses in each of the first two lines of the stanza, three stresses in the third; the second stresses of all three lines rhyme together. The final stresses of all stanzas rhyme together, in this case on a short a-sound in antepenultimate position. Sometimes (as in st. 10) there may also be rhyme between the first stresses of the lines, or (as in lines 19-20) between two of them.

Generally the feet are dactylic, except for the second foot of the third line, which is generally trochaic, but spondaic in st. 12. The dactylic pattern has demanded the form Ghill-Eathain (Illeon in HM) in line 13, and the dialect form ona’ in line 18.

Of the following tunes, the first is taken from Patrick McDonald’s collection of 1784, no. 6, and the second from Simon Fraser’s collection of 1816, no. 198. It should be borne in mind that neither of these collections is likely to give accurate transcriptions of tunes as sung. Fraser (p. 3) was highly critical of McDonald’s work, which he called “ill selected, and worse communicated”. Fraser’s own tunes are set for violin and/or pianoforte (Collinson, Traditional and National Music, p. 112) and, as Dr J. L. Campbell remarks to me, “it is rather disturbing to find trills indicated in traditional Highland melodies” such as these.

In both cases only the top line of the music is given overleaf, other notes being taken to constitute the collectors’ arrangements of the tunes.

It seems fair to say that these are both versions of the same tune. It seems to me that the first section (10 bars) of McDonald’s tune would fit the stanza of the poem, with the last line repeated; and that the remainder (the last 9 bars) would fit the stanza without repetition of the last line. While we cannot be sure that McDonald obtained the tune in connection with the words of the present

[TD 276]

[Ceòl]

poem, we might nevertheless suggest that one method of performing the song was as follows: the stanza was sung, followed by a repetition of the last line and then by a repetition of the stanza. By marking the whole tune to be repeated, McDonald may be indicating that the same procedure is to be carried out in relation to each stanza.

The break after the 10th bar in McDonald’s version is confirmed by the double bar after the 10th bar in Fraser’s. Fraser’s tune, however, seems to point to the repetition of the third line in both cases; the second repetition may account for his last three bars, while his 17th bar has no counterpart in McDonald’s version. It may well be, however, that Fraser’s tune was not noted specifically as a tune for the present poem. On p. 118 he provides the following note on the tune:

“This is an air to which Alexander Fraser of Leadclune, formerly mentioned, who flourished about a century ago, used to repeat fragments of Ossian. There are also words, by a Lachlan M‘Lean, from the Isle of Mull.”

On Alasdair Mac Ùisdein (c. 1685–1775), 2nd of Leadclune,

[TD 277]

see TGSI XLV, pp. 370-371; Mackenzie, History of the Frasers, p. 564. The implication of Fraser’s note, however, when combined with his title, seems to be that Alasdair’s “fragments of Ossian”, or one of them, began with words something like the opening of the present poem.

The following tune appears in MS 14949, p. 73 (the manuscript is not fully paginated), and was written by one of the Maclean Clephane sisters whose mother provided Walter Scott with a text of the poem (see Notes). A bass line in the manuscript is here omitted:

[Ceòl]

Presumably the words Da Capo dal Segno are to be taken to mean that, after the tune has been performed as written, the first four bars are to be performed again. One way of interpreting the tune might be: a stanza is sung once (bars 1-4), then repeated (bars 5-9); then the last line is repeated twice (bars 10 and 11-12), and the stanza repeated (bars 1-4).


2. IORRAM DO SHIR LACHANN

Three-line “strophic” metre, as used in Poem no. 1, but with disyllabic rhyming finals in the first and second lines of each stanza, and final rhyming long o-monosyllable in the third line.

I have found no evidence as to what tune was used for this poem, but the text as written in HM seems to indicate that it was sung with meaningless vocables inserted in the second and third lines. This is indicated by the insertion of letters, generally -o-, in the text, in all cases by the scribe of the main text after the completion of the main text. Vocables are so indicated in the second lines of all stanzas except st. 16, and in the third lines of

[TD 278]

stt. 2, 3 and 5. The following are the relevant lines as in HM, with the insertions in the places indicated:

Line 50: ghiùlen ho (?) do Chesadh
Line 53: òighre dlidheach o no haitribh
Line 54: No pìp s no -o- bratichen sroil.
Line 56: ata ceanntort treun na -o- mor at … (see Notes)
Line 57: Sann dod bhèus bhi scappadh -o- ’nòir
Line 59: chur ad dhlacubh -o- do Chùne,
Line 62: dhuosul -o- i nedigh,
Line 63: ’let gu ’gui iad buoidh -o ’hreun auns gach toir.
Line 65: saun mod relan -o- gu faid iad,
Line 68: stric choscus -o- no cèudin,
Line 71: saun mo d dhuolin -o- gu faid iad,
Line 74: no curinin -ho ro- ’gast
Line 77: chul bhui hic -o- a Sasun,
Line 80: mar o (?) ghrian ’s -o- gun small or (see Notes)
Line 83: ’si gun ier aun -o- s gach geal (?) laimh
Line 86: cruoidh, scalant, ho ro ho (?) caonoil
Line 89: bhi ga spangudh -o- er saiod (?),
Line 92: ga n ashic -o- far chaoldin

Line 86 here may suggest that the vocables actually used in all the second lines were hó ro hó or the like, but we have no clear evidence as to the vocables used in the third lines. I have therefore omitted all such vocables from the text.

Similar uses of meaningless vocables in other poems, including nos. 4 and 12 here, are noted under no. 4, Metres and Tunes, but this is the only instance here where the vocables occur in a line other than the last line of a stanza in “strophic” metre. However, it is clear that some poems in three-line “strophic” metre could be sung with vocables inserted in the second lines, at least when the entire stanzas were repeated in the singing. In M. 566 there is a version of Iain Lom’s Oran do Mhorair Ghlinne Garaidh (Mackenzie ed., p. 132; also ascribed in one source to Eachann Bacach, see below), entitled “Iram of Macdonald”, which was “Taken from the singing of Allan Maclean, Achaforse”. The first verse of the words is written twice below the tune (no. 44), and first appears as follows:

<gai>
Biodh an uimsa triall
Gu ciann uidhe Oh ho nan clithfhear
Far mo shuidh ’s mo mhiann le seoid.
<eng>

[TD 279]

The verse is then repeated but the “Oh ho” is omitted.

Similarly, no. 43 in the same manuscript (also from Allan Maclean, Achaforse) is a version of Iain Lom’s Cumha Alasdair Mhic Cholla (Mackenzie ed., p. 34). Again the verse is written twice below the tune, first appearing as follows:

<gai>
Mi air mo thaobh ’s tom bealathaidh
S beag mo chaoind ris ho ro a’ bhanal
Far an countair an t-aran mar lòn.
<eng>

The verse is then repeated without the “ho ro”.

The poem is called “Iram”, as no. 12 is called “Ioram”, in the title in HM, and I have not translated this word because I cannot be sure of its meaning.

The word has been discussed by Donald T. Mackintosh in SGS VI, pp. 23-26, where it is made clear that, while it may mean “boat-song” or “oar-song” (cf. Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs I, pp. 5 ff.; Campbell, Rites and Customes, p. 49; Collinson, Traditional and National Music, p. 78), iorram has other meanings. The word is commonly found in titles, as they are given in 18th-century sources, of encomiastic poems of the 17th and early 18th centuries, and is in most cases applied to poems in three-line “strophic” metre, like the present poem and no. 12. But the word is not by any means applied to all such poems, nor can we be absolutely sure that poems called iorram in 18th-century sources would have been so called at the time of their composition.

As MacInnes has pointed out (SGS XI, p. 15; cf. Scottish Studies 12, p. 37), it is fanciful to attempt to force the 17th-century encomiastic iorram into the pattern of a boat-song. This is not to say that such an iorram could not be used as a boat-song. The Rev. W. Matheson has drawn my attention to evidence that the three-line “strophic” poem An Làir Dhonn (BG, p. 217) was so used: a traveller in the Ullapool/Cóigeach/Lochinver area in 1787 writes of “irams” used there for rowing (The Bee, Edinburgh, vol. 9, 30th May, 1792, p. 121) and records an English translation of this poem which he was given when he asked for a translation of “a favourite iram”. This poem, which is not encomiastic, is called Iorram na Sgiobaireachd in MN MS A, p. 28: since it was used as a rowing song, it is obvious that any song in the same metre could be similarly used. See also Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair’s iorram in Collinson, Traditional and National Music, p. 79.

[TD 280]

Watson (BG, pp. 1 ff.) appears to use iorram as a metrical term to denote the three-line “strophic” metre; yet in the two encomiastic poems of the period which open with the line ’S i seo iorram na truaighe (BG, p. 201, composed in 1649; and SO, p. 391) quite different metres are used. Mackintosh (SGS VI, p. 25) suggests that iorram may have had the meaning “dirge”, but, even if it had, this is clearly not the meaning in the titles of these 17th-century encomia, for the present poem praises a living person, as do two of the iorraim composed by Iain Lom (Mackenzie ed., pp. 40, 102).

Study of the word iorram itself is of little help towards establishing its meaning, since its origin remains unclear. The word seems to be unknown in Irish and Manx, and there are no poems called iorram in the Book of the Dean of Lismore, or even in the Fernaig manuscript. Some of the current meanings of the word are similar to those of Lowland Scots yirm and yarm, which have Norse and Middle English cognates (SND).

It is often held that iorram is basically a word for “rowing”, being related in some way to the verb iomramh, iomradh, iormadh or (in southern dialects) iomram. For instance, Robertson (Celtic Review V, p. 90) believed that iorram is a metathesis of the imperative, iomair, of this verb (cf. also Scottish Studies I, p. 145). This is, at best, unproven, as is Mackintosh’s suggestion (SGS VI, p. 26) that iorram is a metathesis of an unattested word iomar, which he would equate with Dinneen’s amhar (RIA Contribb. amar), “music, speech, singing, chanting”.

Macbain, on the other hand, derives iorram from a (presumably Old Irish) compound air-rám, “at-oar”, which is not attested. Possibly this idea goes back further than Macbain’s time, for in MS 14949 there are tunes with the following headings: Oran air ramh, a Maclean air ramh (p. 58), and … Oran Gaidhealach air raimh (p. 70; cf. also Metres and Tunes for no. 1 here). Neither this suggestion, however, nor those relating iorram to iomair and iomar can be accepted without some kind of corroboration and, as Mackintosh points out, we have no strong evidence that the word iorram is in any way related to words for “rowing” or “oar”.

We would seem to be left at present, then, without a convincing explanation of the origin of the word iorram, and without a clear statement of the meaning of the word when used in 18th-century sources in the titles of a limited number of 17th and early-18th-century encomiastic poems, mainly in three-

[TD 281]

line “strophic” metres, including the present poem and no. 12.

Of the six poems in the present collection which are in three-line “strophic” metre (nos. 1, 2, 7, 11, 12 and 16), the two (nos. 2 and 12) which have iorram in their titles are the only two in which HM directs that meaningless vocables are to be inserted, in the present case in the second and third lines of each stanza, and in no. 12 in the third line only. It would be invalid to generalise on the basis of the two cases here but, considering that few manuscript sources (other than HM and M. 566) mark such vocables at all, and that printed collections may deliberately have omitted them (cf. SGS XII, p. 219), we might at least consider the possibility that the occurrence of the term iorram in the title of an encomiastic poem in three-line “strophic” metre may be somehow connected with the inclusion of meaningless vocables in the singing. This might give such a poem a similarity to the boat-song iorram, which also made use of meaningless vocables.

Apart from this insertion of vocables, there seems to be no significant difference between the metre of the present poem and that of no. 16.

Iain Lom’s Oran do Mhorair Ghlinne Garaidh (Mackenzie ed., p. 132), which is called an “Iram” in M.566 (see above), appears in Turner’s Collection, p. 111, under the heading Iorram le Eachunn Bachdach. But other versions used by Mackenzie, including one in HM (see p. 288), have quite different headings. Apart from the title of one of the tunes for no. 1 here, I have seen no other iorram ascribed to Eachann Bacach, although nos. 1 and 7 are in similar metres.


3. IS BEAG AOBHAR MO SHÙGRAIDH

This poem is metrically identical with some waulking songs, but if it was sung with the refrains of meaningless vocables usual in waulking songs these have been lost. The metre is that of the 4th type identified in Campbell and Collinson, Hebridean Folksongs I, p. 199: “Couplets of the AB, CD, EF type [i.e. with no repetition of the lines of text], with internal rhyme within the couplets, and the even numbered lines having the same final rhyming vowel throughout the song … This kind of waulking song gives the impression of being the most modern: the poems composed by Alexander MacDonald and Duncan Ban MacIntyre

[TD 282]

in the eighteenth century in waulking-song form are of this type.” The final stress of each line is on the penultimate syllable.

The couplets are thus metrically identical with the individual couplets making up the 8-line stanzas of poem no. 6, so that it is possible for very similar passages to occur in both poems (see Notes).

I have found no tune for this poem.


4. A’ CHNÒ SHAMHNA

This poem is in an irregular “strophic” metre similar to the examples listed in BG, p. liii. The stanza consists of a variable number of lines which each contain two main stresses, followed by a final line containing three main stresses. The second stresses of all the lines rhyme together, and the final stresses of all the stanzas rhyme together (here on a long o monosyllable). In this poem the first stresses of the lines also rhyme together in the great majority of cases. There are, however, many cases where this rhyme does not occur: otherwise we might have good metrical reasons for rejecting some lines (like line 195), and even the whole of st. 16, as not belonging to the original text.

HM and E are alone in indicating that the last line of each stanza is to be repeated: their texts presumably derive ultimately from oral performance of the song. HM is presumably also drawing on the oral performance when he inserts meaningless vocables in the last line of stt. 1-5 and 7 (st. 6 does not occur in HM); the relevant lines are as follows in HM:

Line 135: Fuair sinn ullaidh fear ho roh tho thainme theachd beo.

Line 141: Cuir a Chriosd tuilleadh, ho ro tho ann aite ni dh’ fholbh

Line 146: ’S fhad is cuimhne leinn hò ro tho càradh nam bord.

Line 152: Rìgh bo mheasail u ho a Caumpa Mhontrose

Line 160: Nuair bu sgìth leo ho cuir sgapaodh na feòil

Line 173: Nuair a bhuaileadh ho an t ardan do Phòr

In lines 135 and 152 the vocables were inserted after the line had been written; in line 173 ho is unclear, and may even have been stroked out. It is likely that in performance hò ro hò was inserted between the first and second stresses of the final line of all the stanzas. It is not made clear, however, whether or not these

[TD 283]

vocables are to be inserted in the repeated final lines (cf. no. 2, Metres and Tunes).

Another song in a similar metre, Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn’s Gaoir nam Ban Muileach (1716), seems to have had ho ro inserted in the last line of its stanzas, at least in one version (see MCa, p. 159, line 3). See also no. 12 here, Metres and Tunes.

Sir Walter Scott tells us (see Notes) that “the tune is so popular, that it has since become the war-march, or gathering of the clan”. The only tune I have been able to find occurs in MS 14949, which was written either by Margaret Clephane, who gave Scott his version of the words, or by her sister. Omitting the bass part given in the manuscript, the tune is as follows (p. 57):

[Ceòl]

In the manuscript the “Signo” is placed below the melodic line, but above the bass.

This tune looks as if it might have been regularised somewhat in order to fit the strict time-signature; this may be due to its having been used, as Scott says, as a march. I do not know how to fit the words to this tune.

For another tune for a song in this metre, but without the meaningless vocables, see Tocher 25, p. 20.


5. ÒRAN DO LACHANN

Eight-line stanzas in which each line probably has two main stresses. Lines a, c, e and g most frequently end with antepenultimate stress (though penultimate and ultimate stresses also occur), and lines b, d, f and h form disyllabic rhyme together.

There are many lines in which it is difficult to say where the

[TD 284]

two main stresses occur, and it could be argued in respect of some lines that there are actually four main stresses (e.g. lines 282 and 314). It is probably impossible to be sure of either the rhythm or the metre without knowing the tune, and I have found no indication of what the tune was.

Within most couplets there is an aicill-type rhyme between the last stress of the first line and a word in the second line. This word in the second line may be the first stress (as in line 297) or a word which, according to the two-stress pattern suggested above, is metrically unstressed (as in lines 315 and 321). In the latter case the rhyme probably depended on the tune for its effect.

Within many of the even-numbered lines (e.g. lines 282, 314, 350, 364, 366) there is a further rhyme between the second main stress and what may or may not be the first: again the tune might be crucial in deciding this point.

If we ignore this last-mentioned feature, the metre described above is very similar to that of Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig’s Là a’ siubhal sléibhe dhomh (BG, p. 144) and later poems, apart from the fact that in these the rhyming words (in lines b, d, f and h) are monosyllables. Watson (BG, p. xliii.7) sees the metre of these as deriving from the early syllabic metre called Cró cummaisc etir casbairdni ocus lethrannaigecht [móir], whose couplets are usually formulated as 7³ + 5¹. The present metre could be held to derive in a similar way from a syllabic metre (which is not attested) of the type 7³ + 6², or alternatively to be a relatively recent development from stressed metres based on syllabic poems in the form 7³ + 5¹. We have, of course, no reason to think that the present poem is itself syllabic, but the syllabic origins of the metre may be confirmed by the aicill-type rhyme mentioned above, which does not fit the pattern of a purely stress-based metre.


6. ÒRAN DO SHIR EACHANN

Treating the stanzas as consisting of four long lines (they are so written in N), we can analyse each long line as containing four main stresses in basically dactylic feet: in individual feet, however, there may be three unstressed syllables, and sometimes four or only one. The final stresses of the lines rhyme together throughout the stanza, and the second and third stresses of each

[TD 285]

long line rhyme together: if the stanzas are considered as consisting of eight lines, this latter rhyme appears as a form of aicill. Cf. BG, pp. lix-lx.

The chorus given here is taken from ML, the oldest text containing a chorus, and, as indicated there, it ends with the last two lines of st. 1. It is likely that it was intended to be sung after each stanza (as is indicated in JM and SO), repeating in each case the last two lines of the stanza which preceded it. It is conceivable, however, that the chorus was intended to be sung in all cases as it is given (once only) in ML, i.e. with its last two lines being lines 376-377 (see Notes, line 376).

A different chorus appears in JM and SO. JM heads the poem as follows:

Oran do Shir Eachun Cianta,
Le Eachun bachdach … Luinneag … air founn,
Fail, il, an, ù, hil, an, u hil, an, o ro,
Fail, il, an, ù, hil, an, u, hil, an, o, ro,
Fail, il, an, u, hil an, u, hil, an, o, ro
Fail, il, an, o, ho s’ och, na’n och mar a tha shin

The chorus in SO is very similar to this.

The heading in E says that this song is “ar fonn a la Raon Ruari”. The song referred to is probably that which usually begins “’S e do là, Raon Ruairidh”, usually ascribed to Aonghas Mac Alasdair Ruaidh, and sometimes to Raghnall na Sgéithe (both MacDonalds). There are numerous extant versions of this song, including ML MSS 25, 73; E, p. 188; Gillies’ Collection, pp. 142, 270; Campbell, Treatise, p. 228; GB, p. 103. The metre is the same as that of the present poem, but none of the extant sources has any chorus text. Nor do these sources help us to identify the tune for this poem: in 1933 J. L. Campbell was unable to identify it (Highland Songs, p. 293). But if we accept the statement made in E, it may be that one of the following tunes is that of ’S e do là, Raon Ruairidh.

The first tune given overleaf is no. 15 in M.566. The chorus there, being written in a different rhythm from that of the verse, does not agree in rhythm with the chorus given in the text, or with the JM chorus given above; but since the tune was written down by a sophisticated music-writer, the part written in 12/8 time could equally well have been written in 9/8 time like the rest of the poem, if a different simplification of the sung tune were adopted. The time-signature is likely to be no more than

[TD 286]

[Ceòl]

an approximation used for the purpose of simplification. The “words” of the chorus as given above can perfectly easily be read in the same rhythm as the verse (in 9/8 time, as it were).

Bars 6, 7 and 10 are one quaver short, and the last bar is one or two quavers too long.

A second tune given opposite occurs in MS 14949, p. 57 (where it follows the tune given there for no. 4 here).

In TGSI XLIX, p. 390, Sam Maclean tells us that his aunt sang a traditional Raasay version of verse 15 here to the tune Mo rùn geal òg (e.g. Coisir a’ Mhòid 3, p. 41; cf. S, p. 440): in this version the eight lines of the verse were followed by the words “Mo Lachlainn Mór”, replacing “Mo rùn geal òg”. As Maclean suggests, this may indicate that the verse is an echo of one from an older song concerning Lachlann Mór, the 13th chief of Duart, who died in 1598. But it seems also possible that, with some other four-syllable suffixed line, the tune was used at one time for the whole of the present poem; it may be noted, however, that John

[TD 287]

[Ceòl]

Mackenzie states (SO, p. 374) that the tune for Mo rùn geal òg is “original” (i.e. was composed about 1746).


7. GUR BOCHD NAIDHEACHD DO DHÙTHCHA

Three-line “strophic” metre, as in no. 1 here. Final rhyme of the stanzas here is feminine, on a long e-sound. In stt. 1, 2 and 11 rhyme links the first stresses of the lines, and in st. 12 (and perhaps st. 10) rhyme links two of these stresses (carragh: fearainn).

When sung, the entire verse was apparently repeated (cf. SGS XI, p. 16): in the manuscript (JM) Gur bochd, &c. is written at the end of st. 1, Gu bheil, &c. at the end of st. 2, B’ fhiudh &c. at the end of st. 3, and Bha &c. at the end of st. 12. But I have found no indication of the tune to be used.


8. ÒRAN DO LACHANN, TRIATH CHOLLA

The poem is syllabic, with seven syllables per line, eight lines per stanza; the first line of each couplet ends on a monosyllable, the second having antepenultimate stress and rhyming on a short a-sound throughout the poem. The last word of the first line of each couplet forms aicill in most cases with a word within the second line of the couplet. This metre is very similar to the medieval dían airsheng (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 48), which has, however, only four lines per stanza.

[TD 288]

Having established the metre, I have tried to edit the poem, as found in HM, to fit it. Thus, without affecting the sense in any way, I have added a syllable in lines 558 and 570, and removed a syllable superfluous to the sense in each of lines 565, 575, 607, 615 and 631. Lines 585, 599 and 625, however, remain hypermetrical because to remove a syllable would have altered the sense.

The tune is said in E to be “Wat ye wha I met yestreen”, although HM names no tune. This title is from the opening of a poem by Allan Ramsay (1686–1758); in Johnson’s Scots Musical Museum 11 (1788), no. 171, it is entitled The young Laird and Edinburgh Katy, and opens with the line “Now wat ye wha I met yestreen”. John Glen (Early Scottish Melodies, p. 117) says the poem was published in 1720, and Stenhouse (Johnson, Scots Musical Museum, 1853, vol. IV, p. 168) tells us that Ramsay has preserved, as his opening stanza, the first stanza of “a very old but rather licentious ditty”. There is a Gaelic translation of Ramsay’s poem in Gillies’ Collection (1786), p. 232.

The following version of the tune is taken from Stuart’s collection (c. 1725) of tunes for Ramsay’s Tea Table Miscellany (1723–1727): it appears there (pp. 122-123) with the title as in E, and without words. A bass part is also given by Stuart, but this is omitted here; the last note in bar 6 is written rather ambiguously and might also be E; the fourth and fifth notes of the last bar are written as a dotted quaver and a quaver respectively, and an alternative emendation would be to write them as two quavers. The tune also appears in later collections, usually with Ramsay’s words (e.g. Scots Musical Museum, 1788, loc. cit.).

[Ceòl]

The same tune was also used for Uilleam Ros’ Òran an t-Samhraidh (Calder ed., p. 22; BG, p. 45) which, like Ramsay’s song, is in a much more regular stressed metre than the present poem. We may therefore validly question E’s assertion that this basically syllabic poem was composed to this tune; it may rather be, as has been suggested (Collinson, Traditional and National Music, p. 112 n.), that this poem was composed to a native, or nativised, Gaelic tune similar to Wat ye wha I met yestreen.

[TD 289]

9. ASCAOIN MOLAIDH NA PÌOBA

In N and Inv this poem is written in stanzas of four long lines, equivalent to the eight-line stanzas here; TM has the eight-line stanzas; in HM stt. 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 are written in four long lines, stt. 2 and 4 as eight-line stanzas, and st. 5 is a mixture: lines 672-673 are written as one line, as are lines 678-679, while lines 674-677 are written as separate lines.

As far as I can see, the even-numbered lines vary between three and four stresses (with the possibility of five in line 670), and I can see no pattern in the variation: thus, for example, line 658 has four stresses and line 664 has three. In HM line 668 has additional words to form four stresses, as against three here and in the other sources. The odd-numbered lines, on the other hand, are fixed at two stresses. If the stanzas are seen as consisting of four long lines, this means that the long lines vary between five and six stresses.

Within each stanza, the finals of lines a, c, e and g rhyme together, as do lines b, d, f and h.

Within each couplet, generally, the first stress of the second line rhymes with the penultimate stress of the first line (e.g. mhollachd: cholainn and marag: bhalaich in st. 1), though in some cases this rhyme is absent.

Within the even-numbered lines, the penultimate and antepenultimate stresses frequently rhyme together; this is more usual when the line has four stresses (e.g. arain: marag in line 646; other instances occur in lines, 660, 662, 666, 674, 676, 680, 684, 690, 700, and there are arguable instances in lines 656, 670, 686, 692), but may occur also where there are only three stresses (lines 672, 696, 698 and perhaps 692).

The number of unstressed syllables between the stresses is rarely of metrical significance in stressed poetry, and in this case the number of unstressed syllables before the first stress of the odd-numbered lines varies widely from couplet to couplet (e.g. three unstressed syllables in line 643, none in line 667) and from source to source. I have therefore given these syllables exactly as in N.

The above description also fits Moladh na Pìoba (Appendix II), and the Rev. W. Matheson points out to me that the metres of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair’s poems Marbhrann do pheata coluim (BG, p. 102; Mac-Dhonuill, Ais-eiridh, p. 150) and Guidhe, no ùrnuigh, an ùghdair do ’n cheòlraidh (Ais-eiridh, p. 7)

[TD 290]

are very similar, though the patterns of internal rhymes are different. Watson (BG, p. xliii) treats the first of these poems as syllabic, but the metrical system he suggests fits only a minority of the lines.

A tune might help to clarify the metrical details of these four poems, but I have not found a tune for any of them, nor any clear evidence that any of them was intended to be sung. In regard to the short lines, the metre is reminiscent of the Classical Gaelic snéadhbhairdne, commonly used in “the half-humorous species of eulogy called crosántacht” (Knott, Tadhg Dall I, p. LXXXVIII; Éigse XVII, p. 180); in regard to the variable length of line, it is reminiscent of draighneach (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 73).


10. UAM-S’ THA RÀITINN

The metre is “strophic”, with the number of short lines per “strophe” fixed at three rather than the more usual two (as in no. 7 here). The basic structure, however, is the same as that of no. 7: the shorter lines each have two stresses, the longer lines three. The first stresses of all the lines in the stanza rhyme together, as do the second stresses; the final stresses of the stanzas form penultimate rhyme together on a long o-sound throughout the poem. The rhyme connecting the first stresses of the lines may break down occasionally (as in stt. 3, 12, 20), and does not occur at all in stt. 24 and 25. It should be noted that st. 24, which differs from the rest of the poem in having rhyme on the ultimate in the first three lines, was inserted in the manuscript (HM) after the writing of the rest of the poem had been completed.

The rhythm seems to me to display “a tendency towards an unevenness of movement” similar to that found in some examples of three-line “strophes” (MacInnes, SGS XI, p. 16; see examples in BG, p. xlvii). This effect may, in this case, arise partly from the combination of penultimate stress with a tendency towards syllabic limitation of the lines: a great majority of the short lines each have four syllables, and many of the long lines six. In each line, the (rhyming) second stress occurs on the third syllable, and the (rhyming) first stress may occur on either the first or the second syllable, so that the rhythm is uneven. In st. 24, where there is ultimate rhyme, the rhythm is much more regular. See further SGS XI, p. 25, n. 18.

[TD 291]

A similar metre is used by Mairghread Nighean Lachlainn for a poem printed in BL, p. 215, where there is the equivalent of seven (four-syllable) short lines before the longer line of each stanza.

I have found nothing to say what tune was used for this poem.


11. ÒRAN DO DH’ALASDAIR MAC AN EASBUIG

Three-line “strophic” metre on the same basic pattern as no. 1 (q.v.). First and second lines normally have penultimate stress, but the stress is antepenultimate in st. 6. Final stress of all stanzas is ultimate, rhyming on a long o-sound. Rhyme connecting the first stresses of the lines is common (e.g. stt. 1, 3, 11, 12, 13).

But in this poem this simple scheme does not cover all the rhymes. What we have taken as the first stress of the line (e.g. sgeula: chreuchdadh: dheurach in st. 1) is usually preceded by two unstressed syllables, and in some cases in this poem the first of these syllables also forms rhyme: bochd: olc: osna in st. 1; trom: trom in st. 2; bochd: sproc: spot in st. 3; and perhaps àm: ann in st. 9. We have no good reason to claim that these words are stressed, and it is likely that these “additional” rhymes depend for their effect on the tune rather than on the superficial stress-pattern of the written text (cf. SGS XI, p. 25, n. 18). For mid-18th-century instances of similar “additional” rhymes see Campbell, Highland Songs, p. 180, lines 43-44; p. 184, lines 85-86.

In stt. 1, 2, 3 and 14 JM directs that each stanza be repeated: the first two words of each of these stanzas are written again after the third line. This is the most common method of singing songs in this type of “strophic” metre (SGS XI, p. 16).

The tune for this song is named in JM: “Air founn. thug mi Gealladh do’ n’ Chuirsteir”. This probably means that the tune is that used for Cumha Néill Òig (Gaidheal I, p. 179; GB, p. 21), which is in the same metre as the present poem. In the JM version of this (p. 151) the opening stanza is:

<gai>
Gur h-e mish th air mo chùradh,
Thug mi gealladh do ’n chùrstair,
’S ach cha lig mi fo rùme e ni smò.
<eng>

Unfortunately, I can find nothing to indicate what the tune for this poem is.

[TD 292]

12. IORRAM

Three-line “strophic” metre, basically the same as that of no. 1 (q.v.). Rhyme connects the second stresses of the lines, and in most cases also the first stresses. The final stresses of all stanzas are penultimate, with ua-rhyme.

The final lines of the stanzas appear as follows in HM, the only source, presumably representing a sung performance:

St. 1 Ann damhair o - - n fhaobhair sna buana
St. 2 ’S cha ’n e Cutha o - - gu leir tha gam bhuaireadh
St. 3 Sa chuir snaitheadh o - - gu geir (?) orm mun cuairt domh
St. 4 S d fhag lom mi O - - gun Lunnach gun suanach
St. 5 Ach a Chros-tuath O - - bu daoire gun d’uaras
St. 6 ’S e bagradh O - - gu dana mo bhualadh
St. 7 Do d fhear elle O - - bhi bagradh mo chluaise
St. 8 Na fir óg O - - bu treuna rim Ghualin
St. 9 ’S nach rodh tairel O - - air dlighe dhaon uaisla
St. 10 ’S gum bu scaiteach O le r naimhdian ’ur cruadal
St. 11 Aos dàn O - - cha neridh sibh duois dhoibh
St. 12 ’S cha bu doithabh O - - ro daoire as no bhuaineadh
St. 13 Mo chruas duilich O - - gun bhrathair gun ghuallair
St. 14 She mo roins O do n iomairt as cruaidhe.—

This would indicate that a refrain of meaningless vocables was added between the two unstressed syllables which follow the first stress of these lines; clearly the first vocable is O, and the final line of st. 12 may indicate that the last was ro or rò, as suggested in the note on line 879, but this also leaves us in some doubt as to whether there were three vocables or four. Where the word preceding the refrain ended with a vowel, or the word following it began with a vowel, this vowel could be dropped in the singing, as in stt. 8, 11, 12, 14.

For further comment on this method of singing see no. 2, Metres and Tunes.

I have seen no indication of what tune is to be used for the present poem. Since a version of the opening stanza also opens the later poem Òran do Fhear Dhùn Galain in Turner’s Collection, p. 278 (cf. Macmillan, Bygone Lochaber, p. 137), it is possible that the latter poem used Anndra’s poem as a model, and that the same tune was used: the later poem is in the same metre. But Turner gives no indication that meaningless vocables

[TD 293]

were to be inserted in the third lines of his stanzas; instead he directs that each stanza be sung twice, as in no. 11 here. It is therefore unlikely that the tune intended by Turner or his sources, whatever it may have been, was the same as that intended by the scribe of HM for the present poem.


13. AINDRA MC GHILÉOIN C̅C̅.

This poem is basically syllabic, the metre a very loose form of the Classical Séadna. Séadna is constructed on the formula 8² + 7¹, i.e. in each couplet the first line has eight syllables and ends in a disyllable, and the second has seven syllables and ends in a monosyllable (Knott, Irish Syllabic Poetry, p. 16).

Lines 893 and 895 are hypermetrical as written (see Notes), as is line 890, and line 892 has one syllable too few. Rules for internal rhyme in Séadna are not observed; nor are the rules for alliteration. But rules for aicill (to occur in the second couplet of the normal four-line stanza) are extended to give a form of aicill in (probably) all couplets: comhluinn: fhoghlum; sinnsreadh: linn; Sheanchas: leanmhuinn; Shaxan: ceart.

It is perhaps possible, though we have no direct evidence, that the poem was intended to appear as two four-line stanzas, as is usual for Séadna. The rhyme-system would make this division acceptable, and the two stanzas would each be self-contained in sense.

It seems unlikely that this poem was ever intended to be sung.


14. ÒRAN DO BHARBRA NIGHEAN EASBUIG FULLARTON

Four lines per stanza, two main stresses per line; final stress antepenultimate in the first three lines, ultimate in the fourth. Rhyme connects the final stresses of the first three lines, which also rhyme with a word, stressed or unstressed in this metrical scheme, in the fourth line. There are occasionally (as in st. 5: pòg: glòr: beòil) further rhymes connecting the first three lines of the stanza, often falling on syllables which are metrically unstressed. Between lines 920 and 921 there are two such internal rhymes. The final stresses of the stanzas rhyme together on a long e-sound throughout the poem. In all sources except CC, GB2 and BL we are directed to repeat the last two lines of each

[TD 294]

stanza. The same metre is used in the poem Gun tug mi ionnsaidh bhearraideach (see below), which may date from c. 1650 (see SGS XIII, p. 105), and, without the direction to repeat the last two lines, in Brian agus Iain Lom (Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, p. 60; dated post 1650); a similar metre is used by Burns in Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled.

This metre is “strophic”, since the stanzas are not self-contained in regard to rhyme. Most Gaelic “strophic” poems, however (like nos. 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 16 here), have the final line of the stanza longer than the others, whereas here the final line is shorter: this applies also to the metres of two poems edited by Mackenzie, Orain Iain Luim, pp. 56 and 64. The stanzas of the present poem are thus similar to the individual strophes of a type of òran (a term used by Matheson, Blind Harper, p. 152, to denote a metrically symmetrical poem in the European song-tradition) different from those, like Cuachag nan Craobh (Calder, William Ross, pp. 120, 185), whose individual strophes resemble the stanzas of three-line “strophic” poems.

The only statement as to the tune used appears in Mackenzie’s Cruiteara Gaelach and in the Harp of Caledonia, which name the tune as Ma théid thu null thar linnichean. These are relatively late sources, and we must bear in mind the possibility that the song was not originallyintended to be sung to the tune they name.

The tune intended in these sources is probably that of the poem Gun tug mi ionnsaidh bhearraideach. Versions of the words of this are to be found in Macdhiarmid’s collection (1770), p. 33; ML MSS 76 and 150; MN MS 9 (National Library) and MN MS B (Edinburgh University Library), p. 58; Gillies’ collection (1786), p. 128; the Inverness collection (1806), p. 171; TGSI IX, p. 40; Sinclair’s Òranaiche, p. 383; and GB2, p. 78. The second stanza in Gillies’ version begins: Ma chaidh (alt. theid) thu nunn thair linntichin, and the same stanza occurs in most other versions. The Cruiteara Gaelach and Harp of Caledonia are therefore probably referring to the tune for Gun tug mi ionnsaidh bhearraideach, perhaps the following tune which appears, headed An Jonnsuidh Bhearraideach, in the Appendix, p. 9, to Munro’s Filidh. A bass part has been omitted here, and a few minor misprints corrected. Below bars 8-12 are written the words “repeat the last 2 lines of the verse”. The evidence of the second tune given opposite may suggest that the remaining bars, 13-20, being virtually identical with the first eight, are to be sung to the words of the second stanza.

[TD 295]

[Ceòl]

Another stanza in the song Gun tug mi ionnsaidh bhearraideach begins, in Gillies’ version, where it appears second from the end on p. 131, with the line Tha ghaoth an iar co caithreimeach. This verse also appears as the opening verse of what may be a different song in Sinclair’s Òranaiche, p. 120—though many of the stanzas in this occur also in Gun tug mi ionnsaidh bhearraideach. Two of the stanzas in this second song occur also in Campbell’s Albyn’ s Anthology, vol. I, p. 58, entitled Iorram, do Chlann Raonuill, beginning Tha ghaoth a niar cho chaithramach, which is also the name given for the tune, which appears on p. 59. Campbell tells us that he got the tune and the first stanza “from the singing of LACHLAN MACQUHARIE, one of the tenants in Ulva”:

[Ceòl]

Here an elaborate instrumental accompaniment is omitted; the tune is primarily set to a song in English “written by Mr Fairbairn”, but the Gaelic words are written above the tune. Bars 5-6 are written to a repetition of the second two lines of the stanza, first sung to bars 3-4, and these lines are again repeated to bars 7-8. The remainder, bars 9-12, is set to the second stanza.

[TD 296]

Brian agus Iain Lom is also said to be sung to the tune Ma chuaidh thu null thair linntichean (Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. 378).


15. ÒRAN DO DHÒMHNALL, FEAR BHRÒLAIS

The metre of this poem is the same as that of nos. 7 and 12, three-line “strophic” metre, except that the three-line stanzas are here grouped in pairs to form six-line stanzas. All the longer lines, the third and sixth of all the stanzas, have final rhyme together on a long u-sound followed by an unstressed syllable.

By doubling the three-line stanza, however, thus providing symmetrical stanzas, we take a step away from the “strophic” metre which Matheson (Blind Harper, p. 150) regards as being originally the preserve of the bards, properly so called (the lower grade of poet in earlier times), and move towards the symmetrical vernacular stanzas which Matheson (p. 152) calls òran, and which have counterparts in other European cultures. The present poem can also be viewed, therefore, as consisting of stanzas metrically equivalent to halves of the stanzas of a poem like Cuachag nan Craobh (Calder, William Ross, pp. 120, 185): in some poems in this metre, at least in Ireland, the same final rhyme may connect all the strophes (e.g. de Rís, Ó Doirnín, p. 15).

In many of the stanzas, though not all, the sense of the first three lines runs on into the second three, so that we would not be justified in splitting the stanzas up into three-line stanzas against the evidence of HM.

I have no evidence for the tune. In a South Uist song in the same metre in Tocher 27, p. 144, both half-verses are sung to the same tune.


16. GE GRIANACH AN LATHA

The metre is the same as that of no. 2 here, except that there is no indication of the insertion of any meaningless vocables (nor does the word iorram appear in the title). Rhyme between the first stresses of the lines in a stanza is not very common, but is found e.g. in stt. 14 and 29.

I have seen no indication of what tune is to be used.


17. RAINN

The poem is made up of rhyming couplets, each line being an iambic pentameter. The couplets are therefore metrically

[TD 297]

identical with the “heroic couplet” of English literature: it was (almost certainly) not intended to be sung. In the usual Gaelic stanzaic tradition the pentameter is most frequently dactylic rather than iambic, and rarely rhymes in couplets. Very often, especially in Irish, the second and third stresses of the five-stress line rhyme together (see BG, pp. liv-lv) or, more commonly in Scotland, the second and fourth stresses rhyme together (BG, pp. lvii-lix). In many lines of the present poem this distinctively Gaelic type of rhyme is added to the iambic pentameter, rhyme between the second and third stresses (e.g. lines 1168-1170, 1193, 1204) being less frequent than rhyme between the second and fourth (e.g. lines 1173, 1175-1180, 1210-1212, 1217).

It is more than likely that Maighstir Seathan took this metre from English literature. The “heroic couplet” came to be used for political verse towards the end of the first half of the 17th century (Piper, Heroic Couplet, p. 93), and its greatest exponent for political messages was the English Jacobite John Dryden (1638–1700; see Piper, pp. 112 ff.). Maighstir Seathan could have come to know Dryden’s works during his stay at Glasgow University, and he too was, to some extent, a Jacobite (see lines 1094-1111). Several of Dryden’s poems contain the same kind of racial history as makes up the first part of the present poem, down to line 1193 (see examples given by Piper, pp. 103, 109).

Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair uses the same metre in his poem Moladh do ’n tsean chánoin Ghailic, which was to some extent inspired by the present poem (see Notes). The second part of an anonymous “Cros-dhan” (which may have been composed as a sonnet) in Turner’s Collection, p. 370, is also composed in this type of couplet.


18. ÒRAN D’A LEANNAN

This poem is based on the syllabic rannaigecht mór (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 52, no. 15), for which some of the rules were: four lines per stanza, seven syllables per line, each line to end on a monosyllable, rhyme between the finals of the second and fourth lines, aicill in the second couplet.

Like many poems in this metre, the present poem also has aicill in the first couplet. Some stanzas (7-9, 12, 13, 19, 20) end their third line on a disyllable, so that the second couplet in these resembles the syllabic sétnad mór (Murphy, p. 49, no. 6). There

[TD 298]

are many hypermetrical lines, and lines 1239 and 1272 have only six syllables.

I know of no tune for this poem.


19. ÒRAN GAOIL D’A LEANNAN

Eight-line stanzas with two main stresses per line, each line ending in a disyllable. The 1st and 3rd lines rhyme together, as do the 2nd, 4th and 8th, and the 5th, 6th and 7th: in all stanzas except stt. 6 and 9 the 1st and 3rd lines rhyme on the same vowel as the 5th, 6th and 7th. In other words, the pattern of final rhymes for most verses is ABABAAAB, and for stt. 6 and 9 it is ABABCCCB. In the 5th, 6th and 7th lines, the first stresses can occasionally rhyme together (as in st. 3: duine: mhilleadh), but in the best example of this, st. 7, the length-mark on the word bhàcharan might possibly be questioned (see note on line 1371).

Aicill normally connects the 1st and 2nd lines, the 3rd and 4th, and the 7th and 8th: in the second line of these couplets the word forming aicill is not necessarily the first of the two stressed words postulated above (cf. comments above on the metre of no. 5). Thus, in lines 1336-1337 mànrain might be expected, in terms of the simple stress pattern suggested above, to form aicill with a word in the position occupied by dèan, but the aicill is in fact with gàire, which does not bear a stress in this pattern.

Up to st. 6 each verse begins with the line which concludes the previous verse. This device, similar to the medieval one known as conchlann (on which see Zeitschrift für Celtische Philologie 29, pp. 95 ff.), may have been intended as an aid to the memory of the singer (cf. Tocher 13, p. 181). More fully worked out examples can be found in poems by Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Watson ed., p. 36), An Clàrsair Dall (Matheson ed., p. 46) and Donnchadh nam Pìos (Mac Phàrlain, Lamh-Sgrìobhainn, p. 104, and see note on p. 325), and the device is also used in the “Dan Gaoil” in Turner’s Collection, p. 170. It may not be coincidental that in the present poem it breaks down at the point (st. 6) where the rhyming pattern changes slightly, as noted above.

W. P. Ker, commenting on metres of a similar structure elsewhere in Europe (Form and Style, p. 214), says that such poems are “nearly always related to music”; but in this case I have no evidence by which to identify the tune.

[TD 299]

20. MARBHRANN D’A MHNAOI, ISIBEAL NIC GILL-EÒIN

The metre is basically syllabic, the pattern being that of either sétnad mór (8² + 7¹, i.e. eight syllables in the first and third lines of the quatrain, which end on a disyllable, and seven syllables in the second and fourth lines, which end on a monosyllable) or rannaigecht mór (7¹ + 7¹, i.e. seven syllables in all four lines, which end on a monosyllable); cf. Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 49, no. 6, and p. 52, no. 15. Stanzas 1-3 are on the sétnad mór pattern, st. 10 contains both patterns, and the rest are based on rannaigecht mór.

Rhyme is between the second and fourth lines, but here it may also occur between the first and third (stt. 1, 3, 4 and 11). Aicill is usual between the two lines of each couplet. But the “rules” for the syllable-count are not strictly observed, and there are many hypermetrical lines. Compare no. 18, Metres and Tunes.

I have seen no indication of the tune to be used for this poem.

This text is taken from Tocher, no. 24 (1977), p. 306, with a few changes which are discussed below.

In 1975 Mr Donald Morison (Dòmhnall Chaluim, born 1885; an account of him appears in Tocher, no. 24, p. 289) told me that many years ago he had heard this song sung in the Ross of Mull by a man named Mackinnon, who said it had been composed by Eachann Bacach. Mr Morison could remember only the fonn, which he sang for me: this is the form of the fonn given above, and differs from that in Tocher, no. 24. He had not, he said, come

[TD 302]

across the song again until he saw Creighton and MacLeod’s Gaelic Songs in Nova Scotia (p. 190), published in 1964. He also believed that the text there was wrong in reading Rìgh Seumas in the last line, and suggested that Rìgh Seurlas was correct. I have accordingly made this change, despite the fact that Mr Morison himself, in providing the version in Tocher, no. 24, in 1969, sang Rìgh Seumas, which may therefore have been in the version he had heard from Mackinnon.

I have noted the following other texts of the song, and none of them make any ascription of authorship: the Macdhiarmid manuscript (1770), p. 75; ML MS 87; Gillies’ collection (1786), p. 245; TGSI VIII, p. 115 (Skye); Sinclair, Òranaiche, p. 504; TGSI XXVI, p. 240 (A. Maclean Sinclair); A. and A. Macdonald, Macdonald Collection, p. 49 (cf. Mackechnie, Catalogue, I, p. 487.x); Kennedy Fraser, Songs of the Hebrides II, p. xxii (N. Uist); Craig, Òrain Luaidh, p. 34; Gairm, no. 4 (1953), p. 47; Shaw, Folksongs, p. 228. Dr J. L. Campbell tells me that four versions are to be printed in vol. III of his Hebridean Folksongs, where the textual history of the song will be discussed.

Most of these have a stanza referring to Auldearn, presumably to the battle fought there in 1645 (cf. Thomson, Introduction, p. 68, n. 35), so that the song may date from Eachann Bacach’s lifetime. Some versions, including Macdhiarmid’s, have Rìgh S(h)eurlas in the last line, while others, including ML, have Rìgh Seumas; it is possible that the song was later reworked, perhaps during the Rising of 1715, at least to the extent of changing Seurlas to Seumas.

On the whole it does not seem that we can put much weight on the Mull ascription of the song to Eachann Bacach: the ascription is not supported elsewhere, and the internal evidence of the song seems to suggest that its author was a woman and a MacDonald.

This is the poem to which poem no. 9 seems to reply. It is taken here from the same four sources (N, p. 6; TM, p. 59; Inv, p. 6; HM, p. 17) from which no. 9 is taken, the text principally followed being that of N. There is no ascription of author-

ship in TM. The title in HM is “Molaodh Iain Mac Allen do ghear no Ceppich s don Phip”.

Other versions of the poem may be found in GB, p. 174, and BL, p. 89, the source for these being HM. The version published by William Mackenzie in TGSI IX, p. 49, seems to me to be consistent with being taken from HM with numerous emendations, though I have no evidence that Mackenzie had access to HM. The TM version is printed in RC, II, p. 338, and Cameron’s manuscript copy of TM for RC is extant in CW MS 310 (iv).

DO DH’ANNDRA MAC AN EASBUIG

le Iain Mac Ailein

Beir an t-soraidh-se uam-sa
Gu h-uaigneach do’n lagan-sa shìos
Gu fear ionaid Mhic Guaire,
Ris ’n do shuathadh am breamas tha ’s tìr,
Gun am bàrdan beag beadaidh
Bhith tilgeil a cheapag a nìos,
’S nach bu chòir dha bhith tathaich
Air an fhéill air nach faigheadh e sìon.

Cha b’i comhairle cheartais
Chinn agaibh ’san lagan-sa shìos:
Nuair bha sonnadh no foghail (?) ann,
Dh’fhàg e còir an fhir eile ’san lìon;
Dh’fhàg e t’aghaidh ri còmhrag
’S gun do chlaidheamh air chòir thun do dhìon,
’S dh’fhàg siod sàs air bun t’fheamain,
Mar nòs mhadadh allaidh mu’n ìm.

Mis’ tha fiosrach mar dh’fhàs thu—
Bha mi treis air do chàirdibh an rùn:
Cha b’i Sìne do mhàthair,
Cha mhac easbuig no sàr-dhuine thù;
Cheil a’ bhanaltran dhàna
An leanabh bha àilleachd ’na ghnùis,
’S thilg i thusa ’na àite,
’S cha chòmhnard a dh’fhàg i do shùil.

GABHAIDH MI SGEULA DEM’ SHAGART

le Iain Mac Ailein

Gabhaidh mi sgeula dem’ shagart
Ge nach géill e dh’aidmheil a’ Phàpa:
Bheil móran crona do anam
An fhir fhalaimh dol air fàighe?
No cionnas as còir do’n fhear bheairteach
A chleachdadh ri staid an fhir dhàibhir:
Bheil e laghail dà bhith ’na mhùigean
Is dòrn dùint’ dhèanamh ri bhràthair?

’S ann a dh’fhairich mi ’m fear teagaisg
’Na fhear leatrom orm ’s gach àite;
’S cian on thòisich e rim’ thagar
Mu’n chulaidh aisig a thug càch dhomh.
’S éiginn domh ’n dochair-sa dh’innse
Do Sheanadh fìor-ghlic Earra-ghàidheal,
Gun tug mo mhinistear sgìreachd dhiom
Mo chìsean le làmh làidir;

Nach buineadh do mhinistear pùpaid,
Mura glùtair no dàmh e,
Bhith ’g iarraidh gu biadhana sultmhor
Mar tha mucan is bun-tàta.
’S ann dh’imreadh iad falbh faicleach
’S aig a’ faction gur iomadh nàmhaid:
Chan eil annt’ ach daoine feòlmhor,
Ged tha ’m fòghlam nas leòr àirde.

This poem appears without heading in HM, p. 47, from which it has previously been printed, with emendations, in Maclean Sinclair’s Glenbard Collection, p. 99, and in BL, p. 161. Possibly its subject is Maighstir Seathan (see Introduction, Section 6).

<eng>

[TD 313]

This poem is included as a further instance of the poetry of “dol sìos Chloinn Ghill-Eathain”, discussed in the Introduction, Section 1.

The source is HM, p. 22, from which the poem has previously been edited in GB, p. 144: for some comments on the poem, and on the GB text, see Campbell, Highland Rites and Customes, p. 102. It is unfortunate that no primary source other than HM exists, for there are a few gaps in HM, and some places where the text is unclear to me.

The author, named in the “Clar-innse” to HM (p. III) and in Tocher 25, p. 50 as “(Mr) Iain Peutan”, is the Rev. John Beaton (c. 1640–ante 1716), a member of the medical and literary family attached to the Macleans of Duart (see note on line 131; Scottish Studies 12, pp. 62-63). He became Episcopalian minister of Kilninian in or before 1679 (Scott, Fasti 4, p. 114) and was involved in the researches of Edward Lhuyd for AB (see Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, pp. 12 ff.) in 1700 and later, with John Maclean acting, at least once, as go-between. Lhuyd first met Beaton at Coleraine in Ireland in February, 1700: he may have been there in search of a parish in Ireland, because the abolition of the “prelacy” had been agreed to by king William in 1690 (Mackie, Short History, p. 184) and Episcopalian clergy were gradually being “outed” (Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 12); Beaton may have felt insecure in his Mull parish by 1700.

However, he remained minister of Kilninian, and was probably in his parish in April, 1701, when Robert Wodrow gave John Maclean a list of questions for him (see Introduction, Section 6). But in 1701 (Scott, loc. cit.) he was “outed” for alleged “immoral conduct” (cf. Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 22) and his successor there, as Presbyterian minister, was Maighstir Seathan.

The fìreun of line 18 is Sir Iain of Duart, whose fògradh took place either in 1692, as The Clan Gillean (p. 225) would suggest, or in 1693 (Macphail, Highland Papers I, p. 249). Perhaps the poem was composed shortly after this event, for John Beaton had by then been suffering for a long time the effects of “dol sìos Chloinn Ghill-Eathain”, and in 1683 had complained of destitution as a result of it (Campbell and Thomson, Lhuyd, p. 20). However, it may be that the words Tha mhisneach-san ro-làidir in line 37 show that the preceding stanza is concerned with the poet’s own experiences, so that the poem could date

[TD 314]

from 1701, when he was “outed”, or perhaps from 1700 or earlier, when he left his parish for his visit to Ireland.

Notes

1: ionagh; Drealluin HM. On the name Dreòllainn see note on line 803. In HM only a comma separates Drealluin from tseolsa, and mu’n is here inserted, following GB.

4: laitheil, ach daibhir HM.

5: a mfailiun ga thaisbenadh HM. On stoirm, cf. line 996, and GB, p. 22, line 9. For stàt Dwelly has “pride, haughtiness”, but note also stàta, “state, government”, for which McDonald, Gaelic Words, gives “very high nobles mentioned in tales”.

6: nation a baitim HM.

7: ghreaidhin air Alen; saibheris HM.

8: Aic tin; nios HM.

9: a omitted HM; a ndreapolachd HM. Perhaps an draipealachd means “suddenly”; but note also the form dreapail for dripeil (McDonald, Gaelic Words, p. 105).

11: fàrdin; mheachauntas HM.

12: sárigh; ’phassagh HM. Pasadh is used as a direct equivalent of the English verb pass in a poem in Mac-Dhonuill, Ais-eiridh, p. 110, line 4 (cf. also SGS IV, p. 164, line 5). Here “who would pass the roup highest” may mean “who (among the creditors of a man who died in debt) would have the highest ranking for payment of debt at the sale of the debtor’s possessions”. Perhaps the order of rank was decided by the size of the claim (sàradh).

13: falchor HM. In GB, p. 147, fal-chor is defined as “a drift”, but I have found no substantiation of this. The form may in fact be fàl-chor, since HM is not consistent in marking length. Possibly the first element is a form of the old word all, “cliff, rock” (RIA Contribb.).

14: muir bàit orra HM. In a Tiree verse in Carm. Gad. III, p. 73, muir bàite is translated “drowning sea”; in Macdonald, Poems (1924), p. 249, line 28, the translation offered is “flood”; cf. also Calder, William Ross, p. 40, line 10.

15: a chàbal na dh acruichibh HM.

16: fuchaid HM.

17: HM seems to have cha nfacer, but the text is unclear.

18: fògra; na ’eoin a bheatachach HM.

19: sho’cean HM.

20: There is a space between dath and feadh in HM, and

[TD 315]

perhaps we are to insert air. HM has no sliabh iad, which might represent nan sliabh ud, but note the similar use of iad in line 24 here. The meaning may be that the hawks (= heroes), formerly an attractive and brightly-coloured flock, are now dull and colourless as a result of the loss of their leader. The line ends in HM “eoin fhiaghain ’a pana”, for which GB has “eoin fhiadhain na h-apannan”.

21: fui mhimeas an caitcheante HM. On Clanna Mìlidh see note on line 1166.

24: co maoil doir; caidse dhu HM. Is gun is inserted here following GB, where we are told (p. 147) that caitse is the English word catch. Perhaps the meaning is that the teeth and claws of the lions (= heroes) are now so blunt that even the sheep can take their catch from them.

25: chuile, far iomarla HM. On the form iomarla see note on line 535.

27: neadh; tailcuse HM.

28: In HM the line ends gan asc (or possibly gan ase), and GB is followed here in interpreting this as representing dh’an eascairdean.

29: neimhabh HM. The line in HM ends ris na lag, and the last two syllables are accepted here from GB.

30: nitar HM.

31: The line is blank in HM.

32: steachd; chutichar HM.

33: anamharr; ràtin HM. On the form ràitinn see note on line 704.

35: chiant HM.

36: N doidh HM.

37: Maghisdar HM.

38: fuileag; tailcis HM.

41: ceaunfàth; bhar (? bhur) nachmhasan HM. With the sentiments expressed in this verse compare those of lines 764-771.

42: gneth HM. On the rhyme between gnè and àrach see BG, lines 6644-6646, and the notes there on lines 3211 and 6684.

43: Nuair chual Ri Neimha, an gáth HM. The end of the line is unclear in HM, but seems to be peacuigh followed by bhunabh (? or bhrenabh), though I cannot be sure if a space is intended between these two. Perhaps there has simply been a correction (? from peacuighbh) without the deletion of the letters to be corrected.

[TD 316]

44: na nlàimh san HM.

45: A bhuighin tha co bhuaghach HM.

46: Dhimriadh luch; cheastachadh HM. The word here omitted is unclear, though it seems to end in –ille; perhaps caoille, and GB may be right in reading céille.

47: suairc; baigheach HM. Since it should rhyme with suairce, baigheach may be for buaidheach, a possible form of bòidheach.

48: deantar HM.

I wish to acknowledge an especial debt of gratitude to Dr J. L. Campbell of Canna for help with this poem.
