D	Finlay Dun, Orain na ’h-Albain, Edinburgh, [c. 1848]. The Rev. William Matheson tells me he has evidence that the MS collection on which this book was based (see p. i) may have been compiled by the Rev. Robert MacDonald (the successor of Dr Alexander Irvine in the ministry of Fortingall, Perthshire, d. 1842), who is known to have noted down the words and music of many songs from his father, John MacDonald of Dalchosnie (1722–1809); cf. I, below.

I	A bound black quarto note-book among the Irvine Papers, which are now in the National Library, numbered Acc. 3184. It was written by the Rev. Dr Alexander Irvine (1772–1824), minister of Little Dunkeld, and the poems in it were probably collected between 1800 and 1804 from John MacDonald of Dalchosnie (1722–1809), see AM for details. The first part of the MS comprises 17 poems by Iain Lom (cf. A. M. Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. xvii), and the remainder, with a new pagination, consists of 16 poems by Sìleas na Ceapaich under the title (p. 1): Orain Ghaidhleach agus Laoidhean Le Silis ni’ mhic Raonail.

MD	A bound MS volume of some 230 pages which had been in the possession of John Campbell, the bard of Ledaig, Argyllshire, and which in 1968 was given by his granddaughter to Mr Angus Smith, Fieldworker for the Historical Dictionary of Scottish Gaelic, Glasgow University. It is entitled on the flyleaf: Orain Ghaidhealach a chruinnich Eoghan Macdhiarmid, Duinedin 12th Oct. 1770 Vol: 2d. In addition to songs and poems it contains a collection of Gaelic proverbs numbered 501-749. In 1872, Volume I of this collection was in the possession of John Shaw, meal-miller, at Kenlochrainneach, Perthshire, and John Dewar made copies from it (J. F. Campbell, Leabhar na Feinne, pp. xvii-xviii, 72), and the first 500 proverbs from it were used in Nicolson’s Gaelic Proverbs (see p. xxxiii; Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 321), which was first published in 1881. Volume I is now lost.

The writer of the MS is called Hugh M’Diarmid by Scott, Fasti; he was minister at the Glasgow Gaelic Chapel of Ease 1772–1780 (Vol. 3, p. 436), at Arrochar 1780–1781 (p. 326), and at Comrie from 1781 till his death in 1801 (Vol. 4, p. 263). His Searmona (Eobhann Macdiarmid) were published posthumously in 1804. Campbell’s identification of the writer of Vol. I (Leabhar na Feinne, p. xvii) is mistaken.

For all the above information and for copies from the MS I am indebted to Kenneth D. MacDonald.

ML	The MacLagan MSS, compiled in the second half of the 18th century by the Rev. James MacLagan (1728–1805), and now in the Library of Glasgow University; for details see SGS VIII, p. 178; Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 302. The MSS used here are nos. 7, 47, 120, 124, 146, 165, 212 and 249. No. 165 can be dated to the year 1775 by two of the poem titles in it: “Oran a rinneadh do Phadruig Mac Neacoil an ciad duine do’n ainm a shuigh ann Socach Ghleinn urchaidh & an seathamh ginealach anun o’n duine tha lathair sa bhliadhna 1775”; and “Le gilleaspuig Mac Mhic Ranuill senair an Dune se, 1775”.

MN	The MacNicol MSS which in 1951 were deposited on loan in the National Library by Mr and Mrs J. S. Elliot, Edinburgh. These form part of a collection of MSS made by the Rev. Donald MacNicol (1735–1802), minister of Saddell and Skipness (1763–1766) and later of Lismore and Appin (1766–1802), and by his 8th son, Major Dugald MacNicol (died 1844). They are numbered Acc. 2152 in the National Library. Another part of the collection is in Edinburgh University Library (see Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. xviii). Mrs Elliot (d. 1951) was a great-great-granddaughter of the Rev. Donald MacNicol through his eldest daughter, Mary (information from Mr Donald G. Elliot, Mrs Elliot’s grandson). She deposited the MSS in the National Library as a result of an appeal written to The Scotsman and dated October 11, 1951, by the Rev. J. Mackechnie. This letter notes that at least one of the MacNicol MSS is in Glasgow University Library.

It may well be that MacNicol’s MSS were the source of many of the poems in ML, including Poem no. XIV here; in spite of the approximate date given here in the Table of Sources (1800), many of MacNicol’s MSS are much earlier—one of his Ossianic MSS (MS 24) is dated 1752. MacNicol and MacLagan collaborated on at least one project, a Gaelic dictionary in which James Macintyre of Glenoe and others were also involved (MS 7; cf. Highland Monthly, I, p. 64).

[DA 29]

The complete collection of MacNicol MSS presumably remained in the possession of Dugald MacNicol, who added to them, until 1844. In 1871 they were in the possession of Ludovic Cameron (1840–1884), son of the Rev. Donald MacNicol’s 6th daughter, Alice (b. 1797); in February of that year Cameron lent them to John F. Campbell of Islay, who made a rough catalogue of the contents (MSS 69, 70), and used much of the material in his Leabhar na Feinne, published in the following year (see p. xv of that work). Ludovic Cameron went to China on business, probably in 1871 (Leabhar na Feinne, p. xvi), and the papers came into the custody of Alexander Nicolson (1827–1893), who was Sheriff-substitute for Kirkcudbrightshire from 1872 till 1885. When Nicolson went to Kirkcudbright he seems to have left the papers in the Advocates’ Library in the charge of the Keeper of Manuscripts, Donald C. Macpherson (MS 74), and at least one Ossianic poem was published from the MSS in An Gaidheal (Vol. I, 1873, p. 83; cf. also Vol. II, 1874, pp. 49, 127, 253). Ludovic Cameron called on Macpherson in 1874 and left the MSS in his charge “for the present” (MS 74).

After Ludovic’s death, his wife, Elizabeth (née Campbell), brought the MSS to the Rev. Donald Macfarlane (1861–1923), who was minister of Morven from 1882 till 1907, when he was translated to Gigha and Cara; he was a brother of Mrs Elliot. When George Henderson used the MSS about 1907 the collection still seems to have been intact, for he publishes material (TGSI XXVI, p. 458, XXVII, p. 340; Elma Story, Am Bolg Solair, p. 74) which is now to be found partly in the National Library and partly in Edinburgh University Library. On Elizabeth Cameron’s death in 1928 the MSS became the property of Mrs Elliot. About this time, Mr D. G. Elliot informs me, a section of the collection was lent by a member of the family and was never returned.

on cloth in the old “Irish” hand, and paginated from both ends, A and B. Its contents show that it cannot be much earlier than c. 1750 (see Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 105), and the use of the old script shows that it cannot be very much later, cf. J. L. Campbell, Highland Songs of the Forty-five, p. xxxiii.

Lost Manuscripts

GLENGARRY MS. A Duanaire of 25 poems on the Glengarry family was sent by Colonel Macdonnell of Glengarry to Ewen MacLachlan at the National Library about 1815. MacLachlan copied most of the poems in it into Nat. Lib. MS LXXXI (Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 256), but did not copy the version of Poem no. XIV here, because it was already printed in IC.

IAIN BÀN MS. There may be one or two MSS in question here. In CW, Fr Allan MacDonald copies five poems (that given here in Appendix I, and nos. XVIII, XX, XVII and III) from an earlier MS, and he heads them as follows:

“Hymns & Verses (M.S.S.) given me by Miss Shaw sister of Father John Shaw, Rutherglen (R.I.P.). Father Campbell says they are the writing (i.e. M.S.S.) of John Bàn Keppoch Lochaber.”

Again in his Notebook VI (Henderson MSS), Item 292, where he again copies the poem given here in Appendix I, Fr Allan says of his source MS:

“Late Fr Campbell says the handwriting is that of John Ban Keppoch, with whom and with whose writing he was quite familiar. I got the MS inside a Gaelic book I bought out of Fr Shaw Rutherglen’s library”.

[DA 31]

This MS seems to have been seen by George Henderson before 1898 (Leabhar nan Gleann, p. 140n., cf. p. iv). Before giving his version of Poem no. XIX in H 25/7/1879, D. C. Macpherson (who was a second cousin of Fr Allan MacDonald, see SGS XI, p. 172) says:

“The following was copied from a MS. left by the late Mr John Macdonell (Iain Ban), of Keppoch, who took it down from the recitation of one of Sile’s servants, about the end of last century” (cf. GS12, p. 162).

Macpherson does not tell us whether or not this was also the source of the poems he gives in H 27/6/1879.

Iain Bàn, the writer of the MS(S), appears to have been a son of Aonghas Bàn, 1st MacDonald of Inch, near Keppoch, who was a grandson of Sìleas’ brother, Colla, and who died in 1815 (Clan Donald, III, pp. 461-463). Iain Bàn studied at the Scots College in Rome, but decided not to become a priest (SGS XI, p. 245); it can hardly be doubted that he is the “Joannes MakDonell, filius Aeneae MakDonell Dioecesis Insulanensis” who entered the College on November 11th, 1782, and left it again (sua sponte) on May 5th, 1784 (Anderson, Records of the Scots Colleges, p. 145, no. 332). While in Rome he is said to have met the aged Prince Charles (SGS XI, p. 245). Ian Bàn assisted Donald Gregory in compiling his History of the Western Highlands, first published in 1836 (see 1881 edition, p. v). His collection of poetry included some by Iain Lom, taken down from the latter’s granddaughter, and these were among the poems he lent to the Rev. Robert MacDonald of Dalchosnie (cf. notes on D and I above), who passed them on to Turner for publication in T, see SGS XI, p. 238; AM, p. 77. Iain Bàn’s dates might be roughly conjectured as c. 1765–c. 1850.

I am indebted to Fr R. Macdonald, Campbeltown, and to Mr Victor Gaffney, for information about Fr John Shaw, from whom Fr Allan got his Iain Bàn MS. He was born in 1820 at Stronavaich on the river Conglas, Strathavon, Banffshire, entered Blairs College, Aberdeen, in 1833, and was ordained priest in Paris in 1846. He then served in Glasgow till 1850, and in Rutherglen till his death on 3rd November 1885. He was well known as a scholar in scientific subjects (The Catholic Directory, 1886). His family had been long settled in Strathavon (A. M. Shaw,

[DA 32]

Genealogical Account, p. 56), and his birthplace, Stronavaich, is only about three miles from Camdell, where Sìleas spent a large part of her life (see Introduction). It is therefore possible, if little more, that the MS which Fr Allan found in a book of his could have been the same one taken down by Ian Bàn from an old servant of Sìleas and used by D. C. Miacpherson; perhaps the servant in question was a member of Fr Shaw’s family or a neighbour.

Against this speculation, however, it is worth noting that while Fr Allan copied various poems from his MS, he did not take a copy of Poem no. XIX, as might have have been expected if his MS had contained this poem; Macpherson gives no. XIX from his MS. So it remains possible that there are two distinct MSS in question here.

The Fr Campbell referred to by Fr Allan is Fr Alexander Campbell (1820–1893), a native of South Uist (cf. McDonald, Gaelic Words and Expressions, p. 9).

1.
An toiseach m’ aimsir is mo dhòigh ri bargan
Gun robh mi ’g earbsa nach cealgte orm;			45
Cha chòmhradh cearbach air ro-bheag leanmhuinn
Bho aois mo leanbaidh chaidh fheuchainn dhòmhs’;
Ach nis bho chì mi cor nan daoine,
An comunn gaolach gur faoin a ghlòr,
Cha dèan mi m’ aontadh ri neach fo ’n t-saoghal;		50
Chan eil gach aon diùbh air aon chainnt beòil.

Nach fhaic sibh òig-fhear nam meall-shùil bòidheach,
Le theangaidh leòmaich ’s e labhairt rium,
Le spuir ’s le bhòtan, le ad ’s le chleòca,
Le chorra-cheann spòrsail an òr-fhuilt duinn;			55
Saoilidh gòrag le bhriathraibh mòrach
’Ga cur an dòchas le glòr a chinn;
“A ghaoil, gabh truas rium ’s na leig gu h-uaigh mi;
Do ghaol a bhuair mi bho ghluais mi fhìn.

“Le d’ theangaidh leacaich nam briathran tearca,		60
’S e saobhadh t’ fhacail dh’fhàg sac ’gam leòn;
Gu bheil mi ’g altrum am thaobh an tacaid
A rinn mo ghlacadh ’s mo ghreas’ fo ’n fhòid.”

Na geallan breugach air bheag reusan,
Fallsail, eucorach, neo-ghlan rùn,
Air eagal bhreugan no masladh fhaotainn			70
’S ann leam nach b’ éibhinn taobhsann riù;
A chlann, na éisdibh ri ’n glòr gun éifeachd,
’S na toiribh spéis do fhear caogaidh shùil;
Gur h-aobhar reusain dhuibhs’ an tréigeadh—
’S ann annta fhéin a bhios gné nan lùb.			75

5.
Bha mi uair ’nuair a bha mi ’m ghruagaich
Gum fuighinn uaigneas gun fhios do chàch;
Mar shamhladh bruadair an diugh ’ga luaidh rium,
Gun dad de bhuanachd ach buaidh mar ghnàth,
Na geallan glé-mhór a gheobhainn fhéin bhuap’		80
Air chor ’s nach tréigeadh iad mi gu bràth;
A nis is léir dhomh na rinn mi dh’ eucoir
’S a’ mheud ’s a dh’éisd mi d’ am breugan bàth.

6.
Ach a fhearaibh òga, ge mór nur bòlaich,
’S math ’s aithne dhòmh-sa cuid mhór d’ ur gnàths:		85
Gu barrail, bòidheach sibh tighinn am chòmhdhail,
Le ’r teangaidh leòmaich ’s le ’r còmhradh tlàth;
Ghabhte ceòl leibh an aodann gòraig,
’S mur bidh i eòlach gun gabh i à:
’Nuair bhios e stòlda ’s ’nuair gheobh e leòr dhi,		90
Gum bidh Ochòin aic’ an lorg bhith bàth.

A ghruagach chéillidh na creid fhéin iad,
An car-fo’n-sgéith sin bhios ann an gràdh;

Taobh an inntinn mar as cinnteach,

Na dèan do lochd leis an t-sochar-dhàil.

Ged robh fear leumnach ’n an déidh mar chùl;
Dh’ aindheoin uaigneis is raspars uasal,
Na leig e ’n uachdar air chruas a ghlùin,			105
Ach cum e ’n ìochdar ge b’ oil le fhiacaill,
Mur toir e bhriathar gur fhiach leis thu.

Am fear a thriallas a dhol a dh’iarraidh
Na mnà as miannaiche bhios d’ a réir,
Gur cailinn shuairc i nach fhuilig mì-stuamachd,		110
Na dhol an uaigneas le neach fo ’n ghréin;
Mar shamhladh bhà sud, a bhrìgh a nàire,
Dhol nas dàine na mànran béil;
Bheir fear gun riaghailt an sin a bhriathar
Gu bheil i fiadhta ’s nach fhiach a gné.			115

10.
Ma bhios i gléidhteach air nì ’s air feudail,
Their fear gun reusan gum bidh i crìon,
’S ma bhios i pàirteach air nithe àraidh,
Gun abair càch rith’ gum b’ fheàrrd’ i ciall;
An té tha stròdhail, cha bhuin in dhòmh-sa			120
Mar chéile pòsta bhon tha i fial;
Gur cailinn shàmhach nach fhuilig tàmailt,
A mòid no mànran an àirde miann.

Ochòin, a nochd mar a thà,
’S am Bàs air teachd orm gun fhios;				125
Labhair e gu calma cruaidh:
’S éiginn uair a dhèanamh ris.

2.
Fhreagair mise gu bochd truagh:
“Gu dé ghruaim a chuir mi ort,
’Nuair thàinig thu cho coimheach garg,			130
’S nach do ghormaich snàithn’ dhe m’ fholt?”

Bàs:
3.
“Cha b’ e sin a b’ fhasan domh fhéin,
Feitheamh ris gach té bhith liath;
Gabhaidh mi an sean ’s an t-òg—
’S math mo chòir air luchd nan srian.”			135

Ise:
4.
“Chan eil mo chuideachd ach maoth;
’S còir bhith caomhail ris a’ chloinn
Gus an àraichear an t-òg,
’S a’ chuid as mò dhiùbh chur an greim.”

Bàs:
5.
“Gu dé ’n t-iomradh th’ agad dhiùbh,				140
’S nach dèan aon neach dhiùbh do riar?
B’ fheàrr dhuit an leigeil air chùl,
’S an aire thoirt gu dlùth air Dia.”

Ise:
6.
“Nan saoilinn gum biodh tu rìreadh,
Dhèanainn gu cinnteach riut comunn,			145
Gun tugadh tu mi gu m’ Shlànair,
’S comas a bhith ’ghnàth ’na shealladh.”

Bàs:
7.
“Nì mise mo chuid de ’n bheart sin,
Nì mi do leagail o ’n àrdan;

[TD 13]

[Beurla]

[TD 14]

Fàgaidh mi do chasan caol is					150
Nì na daolagan dìot fàrdach.”

Ise:
8.
“Ochòin, ma tha thu dha rìreadh,
’S nach faigh mi sìneadh no dàil bhuat,
Feuch an toir thu orm ìsleadh,
Gus an dèan mi sìth ri m’ Àrd-righ.”				155

Bàs:
9.
“’S iomadh latha fhuair thu roimhe,
’S bu bheag t’ omhail air a’ chàs sin;
O nach do sheall thu na b’ fheàrr romhad,
Nì mise ’n gnothach an dràsda.”

10.
Bhuail e buille mhór ’sa’ taobh orm;				160
Cha d’ fhoghainn a h-aon na dhà leis,
Gus an tug e orm bhith glaodhaich,
’S bu bheart fhaoin domh buntainn dhà-san.

11.
’Nuair a thuig mi e bhith rìreadh,
Thug mi sgrìob fo sgéith mo Shlànair;			165
Rinn E rium ro-mhóran caoimhneis
’S thug E air an Aog bhith sàmhach.

12.
“Cha toir Mise tuille péine
Do ’n chreutar bhochd tha mì-thaingeil,
Feuch an tig i orm na’s ùmhlaidh’,				170
’S an cuir i cùl ris an àrdan.”

’Ga gheàrradh air gach truinnsear:
Ma ’s fiach sibh bidh se cuimhnichte,

A’ ruith air beart mi-ghnàthaichte,

’S gun crùinteadh an Sasunn leibh ’n rìgh.

Beir soraidh gu Dòmhnall o ’n Dùn,
Gu h-Uilleam ’s gu Seumas ’n an triùir:

Glac an t-urram a fhuair thu le cliù.

As do chruadal gun earbainn deagh-ghnìomh;
’Nuair a théid thu gu buillean,				245

Gu cinnteach bidh fuil air am bian.

’S chan fhiù dhuinn bhith ’g osnaich mu bhàs.”

Cuir sgairt ort gu feachd an taobh tuath,
Cuir spuir ort ’s bi gleusta					270

’S cuir Mac Cailein fo ghéill mar bu dual.

Thug thu tamull a’ feitheamh ’s an Fhraing;

’S cuir na Caimbeulaich dhachaidh ’n an deann.

Leis a dh’éireadh a’ bhuidheann gun fheall:

Mur bhiodh Chuigse bhith aca mar cheann.

Far an robh sibh ri péidseachas riamh,
’S cha b’ ann ’g osnaich air mullach nan sliabh,
A liuthad cùbaid tha ’n dràsda				290
Fo chùram na gràisge,
Agus easbuig fo àilgheas nam biast.

A Dhonnchaidh, ma dh’imich thu null,
Tha do chiabhan air glasadh fo chliù;
Gun cluinneam ’s gum faiceam				295
Do philleadh-sa dhachaidh,
’S do chinneach nach stad air do chùl.

Nach geàrradh sibh as mar an càl?

’Nuair a ruigeas sibh Lunnainn nan cleòc,
’S a bheir sibh an fhàistinneachd beò,

’S beagan each nach b’ fhiach,

Cho uallach ’s a bha mi roimhe,				880
Cha chluinnte ri m’ bheò mi
Cur tòir air an Obair Nodha;
Mur faighinn fear pòsda
Le deòin a dhèanadh mo ghnothach,
Cha bu diù leam cuairt					885
Do dh’fhear fuadain a shiùbhladh roimhe.

Mo chomhairle ’s an tìm so
Do nianaig i bhith gu taidheach;
Bhith gu teisteil diamhair
Gun mhì-mhodh idir a ghabhail				890
O na gillean òga
Air bhòidhchead ’s am bidh an labhairt,
Ach gun dèan sibh còrdadh,
Pòsadh is dol a laighe.

Bidh cràdh aig màthair is athair;
’S mo nianagan gaolach,
Bithibh cuimhneach air na tha mi ’g ràdh.			910

’G ur éigheadh a stigh gu h-Eaglais—
Chan usa dhuibh na h-éildearan

D’ ur càirdean, mur bidh sibh teisteil.

“Beir uam i! Chan fhaca mis i!”

Bàthamaid le deòir ar sùl i.					990

A’ bhéist air am bheil na seachd cinn,

Ar cainnt a bhith céillidh glic,
Ar deòir a bhith air ar sùilean,
’S dol air ar n-ùrnaigh gu tric.

Saighead a chur ann a casan					1015
A bhith leanailt nan ceart cheuman
Gu imeachd an déidh ar Slànuigheir
Air a’ bhàir a rinn E fhéin duinn.

Saighead a chur ann a gàirdein
Gun do làmh gu meàirl’ a shìneadh;				1020

A shireadh air càch gu sìobhalt.

Glòir is onair thoirt dh’ a chionn

Cuireamaid cùl ris an t-saoghal				1055
Mun leag sinn ar taobh ’s an leaba,
Gun fhios nach i uair a’ chunntais
’S faisge dhuinne na a’ mhadainn.

Smaoinicheamaid air ar leaba
Gur e sud leth-bhreac na h-uaghach;				1060
Gur i chiste chaol ’s an téid sinn
Na déilichean bhios mun cuairt duinn.

Gur i sud éideadh na fuarachd;
H-uile h-uair a nì sinn dùsgadh				1065
Gur i ’n ùir bhios air ar n-uachdar.

Oidhche ’n déidh dhomh dol a chadal
Bu neò-aighearach mo dhùsgadh;
’S ann a fhuair mi fear an tighe
’S e gun labhairt air mo chùlaobh.				1070

Cha robh agam-sa de ghoireas

’S ìosal an ceum thug ar Slànair				1085
A nuas o Phàrras gu talamh
’Nuair a rugadh E ’s an stàbull,
Gun tuilleadh àite dhà falamh.

Cha d’iarr ban-rìghinn na h-ùmhlachd

Ach Rìgh nan Dùl bhith ’ga còmhnadh.

Cuision na cluasag na leabaidh,
Gus an d’éirich leis a’ mhàthair
’Ga chur ’s a’ mhainnseir ’n a chadal.			1100

Gaol is gràdh is fàilte ’s fìrinn.

’Nuair chuala Hérod an àrdain
An Tàrganach teachd gu talamh,				1110
Cha d’fhàg e macan aig màthair
Gun a chur gu bàs an ealachd.

Cha d’fhuirich E ach ri seachdain
An déidh a ghearradh ’s an Teampull,
Gun fhalbh a dh’oidhche ’s a latha				1115
Do ’n Eiphit a ghabhail tàmha.

’Ga altrum agus ’ga àrach,
Ann an gaol ’s an gràdh ’s an dùrachd
Fo chùram Athar ’s a mhàthar.				1120

’Nuair chuala iad gun d’eug Hérod
Smuainich iad ceum a thoirt dhachaidh;
Aig fhad ’s a rinn iad am fàgail,

’Nuair nach b’ urrainn iad g’ a fhaotainn,			1130

“Mhàthair, na biodh ort-sa mulad
Ged a dh’fhuirich mi ’s an Teampull:

Ged fhògrar sinn as an rìoghachd
’S beag an dìobhail do ’n Phàp e;

Thog mo Rìgh air carraig làidir.

No cumhachdan nan daoine
Car a thoirt di as a làraich—
A clachairean cha d’fhàg cho faoin i;				1200

Rinn iad uinneagan de chreuchdan;
’S ann de bheul a rinn iad dorus,
’S tha dhà shùil gu solus glé-gheal.

3.
Rinn iad sgliata de chrùn draigheann				1205
Agus staidhir de chrois cheusaidh;
Rinn iad le traisg is le ùrnaigh
A teannachadh gu dlùth ri chéile;
’S i Moire Bhain-tighearn a h-ùrlar;
Dh’fhùirneisich dà ostal deug i—				1210
’S mór a fhuair iad rithe shaothair
Feadh an saoghail gus an d’eug iad.

Corp glòrmhor Chrìosda is Faosaid,
Ola-ro-Bhàs, Òrdugh is Pòsadh—
Sin na seachd as còir dhuinn fhaotainn.

Umhlachd, féileachd agus geamnachd,
Carantachd do ghnàth do ’n fheumach;
Foidhidinn, measarrachd, èasgachd,
Bhith leinn ’s gach àite ’s an téid sinn.

8.
Seachd obraichean na tròcaire				1245

NOTES

I. DO MHÀIRI A NIGHEAN

My only primary source for this poem is I, which ascribes it to Sìleas, and from which it has been printed in AM, p. 79.

The place-name Tom Mhuilinn in line 22 can hardly be other than that now generally spelt Tomnavoulin, in Glenlivet, some six miles north-east of Tomintoul, Banffshire. The rest of the poem is likewise consistent with its having been written at the farm of Camdell, near Tomintoul, where we assume that Sìleas lived from the time of her marriage to Alexander Gordon (in 1685 or before) until they moved to Beldorney (cf. Introduction, Section 3).

The general tone of the poem indicates that Màiri was a young girl, perhaps barely in her teens, when it was composed. Since we have no further information about Màiri, we can only say that, because of line 38, the poem was composed before 1715, although this line could also refer to the coming of King James in 1708 (cf. also note on line 22, below).

If we took lines 34-39 literally, Màiri would have had the same fostermother as King James (James VIII, as he was called, was born in 1688). But as this seems unlikely, and I have found no evidence for it, it is probable that Sìleas is merely linking the name of Màiri’s fostermother (or nurse?) with that of the Royal family in a fanciful way.

Màiri also figures in some versions of Poem no. II (see Sources and Readings, line 100).


16-17. lubagan: the short -u- of the MS is retained in an attempt to give the required rhyme with ruibean (MS ribean). Lùbag may denote some form of earring rather than a whorl in the ear itself, for a ribbon in the ear is somewhat hard to imagine. For the MS ribean we might also consider substituting Dwelly’s word rùban, “ruby”, which would rhyme with lùbagan and perhaps give better sense.

[TD 124]

Line 16 is hypermetrical, and the Rev. W. Matheson suggests to me that the original form of the line may have been:

Na cluasan ’m bidh na lubagan.

19. The absence of a word to form aicill-rhyme with cheannach indicates that daoin’ òga has replaced the original rhyming word; Mr Matheson suggests that the original word may have been fleasgaich.

20. The farm directly across the river Avon from Camdellmore is Torrans, and from 1694 till 1712 it seems to have been held by Sìleas’ husband (Gaffney, Lordship of Strathavon, pp. 134-136). We are told (see Appendix V) that Alexander’s own house at Urlarmore was “Capable only to be accomodat in Faill divot grass etc from the uther side of the water”. Somhairle may have been a son of Alexander’s tenant in Torrans.

22. Tom Mhuilinn, now Tomnavoulin (see above), is variously spelt in documents of the time with or without the -na-: Tomnavillen 1680 (Gaffney, Lordship, p. 191), Tomweillane 1683 (ibid., p. 192), Tomnovillan 1690 (Grant, Records of Banff, p. 278), Tamnavillan 1698 (Gaffney, p. 193), Tomvullan and Tomnavullane 1708 (p. 194), Tomvulne 1718 (p. 201), Tomavulne 1722 (p. 205).

From these forms, in spite of the -na-, it seems quite likely that Tom (a’) Mhuilinn is the original form of the name.

The laird of Tomnavoulin is named as John Grant (of Tomnavoulin) in 1680 (Gaffney, op. cit., p. 191), 1690 (Grant, Records of Banff, p. 278) and 1698 (Gaffney, p. 192), but we cannot be sure that the same individual is referred to in all three cases, or that John Grant was still laird when this poem was written. According to Charles Grant (Glenmoriston, p. 528), “The Grants of … Tamnavallan … are descended from Patrick second son of Sir Duncan Grant seventh Grant of Grant”, but I have found no confirmation of this. Nor do I know what the laird (or his mother, perhaps) did to deserve this condemnation by Sìleas. It may be worth noting that John Grant of Tomnavoulin was acting, perhaps as bailie, for the Duke of Gordon in 1698 (Gaffney, p. 192).

Kenneth MacDonald suggests to me that Grant is objected to simply because he supported King George: the Hanoverians were frequently alluded to as swine in Gaelic poetry (cf. lines 202, 591). This suggestion would probably date the poem to 1714 or after, which is not impossible.

[TD 125]

26. The MacGregors were fairly numerous in Strathavon already in the mid-16th century; they were mainly refugees from the south and, in effect, outlaws. After the battle of Glenfruin in 1603 even their name was outlawed (A. G. M. MacGregor, History of Clan Gregor I, pp. 149 ff.) and they appear to have been generally considered delinquent, thieving and warlike in Strathavon (Gaffney, Lordship, pp. 66 ff.), not least, apparently, by Sìleas.

32. Ceapach: This may be either Sìleas’ ancestral home in Lochaber, or the farm of Ceapach, some two miles south of Camdell along the river Avon (see 6" Ordnance Survey Map of Banffshire, Sheet XLIII). The latter alternative seems much more likely in that other names in the poem are evidently in reference to Strathavon; but if the Strathavon Ceapach is referred to, then oighear could not be taken literally and would have to mean something like “son”, for this land was held in tack by Alexander Gordon after 1694 and may have been in his hands when the poem was written; see Gaffney, Lordship, p. 134, where some of Alexander’s sub-tenants are named.

Alternatively, it remains possible that the reference is to Keppoch in Lochaber, in which case we have a proper heir in Alasdair, son of Colla nam Bó, who was probably not much older than Màiri (Clan Donald II, p. 658); he was, of course, her cousin.

38. James (VIII) made his first attempt to come to Scotland in 1708 (Tayler, Old Chevalier, Ch. II), and he then made no further attempt till he landed in 1715.


II. COMHAIRLE AIR NA NIGHEANAN ÒGA

The earliest source I have for this poem is ML MS 7 (c. 1775), and it also appears in T, p. 296 (copied in Me, p. 29); four stanzas (5-8) occur in I. On the whole, the ML version differs significantly from the others, and I have followed it here as far as possible.

This song and no. XV are presumably those which earned specific condemnation from William Mackenzie (IA), who says they are “such as the coarsest would not dream of singing in decent society”, cf. GS7, p. 114. These are probably also the songs which, it has been suggested (MB, p. 92), could not possibly, on account of their indelicate content, have been composed by Sìleas. Lines 120-121 of the present poem, which

[TD 126]

occur only in ML, might be interpreted as suggesting that the poem was written by a man rather than a woman, but there is no other solid reason for doubting the ascription to Sìleas in I, T and IA. As to the “indelicate content”, Mackenzie admits (IA): “Yet it is strange that they are all composed—intentionally or unintentionally, we cannot say—as helpmates to morality!” See also Notes to Poem no. XV.

In I the poem is entitled Comhairle do Mhàiri a h-Ighean, and I and T begin line 100: “A Mhàiri dheud-gheal” (and line 92: “A nighean chéillidh”). If this could be shown to be original, then the poem could be dated fairly well to the time when Màiri (a child in Poem no. I) would have been in her later teens. It is on this very doubtful basis that the poem is placed here. But the ML version may represent older tradition in addressing the poem to girls in general, thus giving no direct dating evidence at all. The poem’s similarity of theme to Poem no. XV might suggest that the two poems are of similar date, i.e. after 1720.

I have found the present poem very difficult, and my interpretation of it is particularly arbitrary and personal, in that many passages are capable of several different readings from the sources, and of several different interpretations of the readings.


73. do fhear caogaidh shùil: a tentative emendation for the do fhear caog thuil of ML, which leaves the line short. I can make no sense of the text of T here, d’ a ’n sméadadadh sul.

99. sochar-dhàil: various meanings seem possible for this compound: sochar, “silly” or “shy”, and dàil, “a delay” or “a tryst, meeting, attachment”.


III. CÒMHRADH RIS A’ BHÀS

This poem comes from three sources: CW (copied from the lost Iain Bàn MS; the poem was also copied from this in A and published in LS, p. 19), H 27/6/1879, and I.

As suggested in the Introduction (Section 5), the chances are that the danger of death which gave rise to this poem arose during her well-known illness, which is thus, by the evidence of lines 131 and 136, to be dated between c. 1690 and c. 1710. But obviously the date of the illness, in spite of line 124, does not give us a date for this poem, and its position here has been decided arbitrarily.

[TD 127]

The basic theme of a conversation with Death is found elsewhere in Gaelic poetry. Of a number of such poems in Irish perhaps the best known is An Peacach agus an Bás by Pádraig Denn (1756–1828), see Ó Canainn, Filíocht no nGael, no. 254. In the case of the present poem we must also compare the English Death and the Lady theme discussed by Anne G. Gilchrist in Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, IV. English and Scandinavian songs discussed there show some similarities to the present poem, especially in the form of pleading with Death (lines 128-139). Miss Gilchrist believed that the theme originated in a 14th-century acted morality called The Dance of Death.


131. ghormaich: Professor D. S. Thomson suggests to me that the use of this rather unusual verb may imply that Sìleas’ hair was black rather than fair.

135. luchd nan srian: I am taking this to mean literally “people of streaks”, which may be a way of denoting the middle-aged, whose hair is streaked with grey; it might also denote those whose faces are marked by disease (including Sìleas herself, perhaps). But srian could also be taken as meaning “bridle”, and Death might also be referring to those who can ride horses, i.e. those who are neither very young nor very old.

159. The implication here may be that Sìleas will have to be content to go with Death rather than with God (“m’ Àrd-righ”, line 155), since she has hitherto been neglectful of God.


IV. DO RÌGH SEUMAS

This poem is taken from I and T, and there are no major differences between the two texts. It can be dated on internal evidence to late in 1714 or early in 1715. Queen Anne, daughter of James VII, died on 1st August 1714, and George I (1714–1727) succeeded her within a few hours (Tayler, Old Chevalier, p. 51). George Lewis, King George I, son of Sophia, granddaughter of James VI, had been Elector of Hanover (cf. line 196) and he arrived in England to take his throne on 18th September 1714.

James Francis Edward Stuart (1688–1766), the subject of this poem, son and heir of James VII (who died in exile in 1701) was known to the Jacobites as King James VIII, and they hoped that he might be allowed to succeed Anne. Having been

[TD 128]

expelled from Paris in accordance with the Treaty of Utrecht (1711–1713), he was living in Lorraine when Anne died. On hearing of George’s succession he issued from there a declaration on 15th October 1714, which is printed by the Taylers in The Old Chevalier, pp. 172 ff. (cf. also p. 47) and in 1715: The Story of the Rising, p. 311. In the course of this he stated:

We are come to take our part in all Dangers and Difficulties to which every one of our Subjects may be exposed on this important Occasion, to relieve our Subjects of Scotland, from the hardships they groan under on account of the late unhappy Union, and to restore the Kingdom to its ancient free and independent state (Old Chevalier, p. 175).

He went on to promise pardon to those of his opponents

who shall at or after Our Landing, and before they engage in any Action against Us, or Our Forces, from that time lay hold on Mercy, and return to that duty and Allegiance which they owe to Us, their only Rightful and Lawful Sovereign (ibid., pp. 176-177).

The present poem may have been inspired by Sìleas’ hearing of this declaration, the first statement that James intended to resist George’s succession by force. The resultant Rising, called for in st. 5, may be said to have begun in August 1715, when the Earl of Mar assembled his hunting-party at Braemar (Poem no. V, Notes). The poem was therefore probably written between October 1714 and the summer of 1715. The doubt expressed (lines 174, 180, 190) as to the truth of the report of James’ coming might indicate that the poem was written in the earlier part of this period (perhaps before the end of 1714); since Sìleas was a member of two prominent Jacobite families it is likely that news of the intentions of James would reach her fairly quickly.


176, 192-194. Sìleas can hardly have thought that James was already on his way to Scotland, and is probably using these lines to hasten the Rising. James did not put to sea till 16th December 1715, by which time the Rising was virtually over (Tayler, Old Chevalier, p. 75).

182. James had hoped to bring a large army from France. But King Louis XIV, the benefactor of James VII, died in September 1715, and was succeeded in power by the Regent

[TD 129]

Duke of Orleans, who was unwilling to risk a quarrel with George. So when James finally reached Scotland there was only one small ship to transport him and a few friends (ibid., pp. 54-55, 75-76).

202. I have tampered with the sources (I and T) to supply the form marcach; both sources read marcaich, which, while valid as a noun, could be understood as a verb, thus changing the sense of the proverb to its disadvantage, in my opinion (“A saddled pig will not ride”).

I have not seen the proverb elsewhere, though we might compare: “A pig in the parlor is still a pig” (Burton Stevenson’s Book of Proverbs, p. 1790, no. 14). The reference seems certain to refer to George as a pig riding on a horse, probably representing his throne, but a very similar analogy appears in another Jacobite song of the same period (Hogg, Jacobite Relics, I, pp. 82-83), and Hogg says (p. 262) that in this case the sow riding on an ass is the Countess of Darlington riding on King George. He also tells us (pp. 268 f.) that reference to sows, representing George’s mistresses, is frequent in Jacobite poems, and perhaps the word muc here and in line 591 should be translated as sow.

208. Until the death of Queen Anne the London government had been paying pensions of £360 a year to the Highland chiefs to buy their peace (Howlett, Highland Constable, pp. 114, 117).

214-217. This passage seems to hang on a pun on the word uinnean, here representing both “onion” and “Union” in English. The Act of Union, so objected to by James, was passed in 1707 and gave the government of Scotland into the hands of a London parliament. The resentment it caused in the Highlands is forcefully expressed by Iain Lom (A. M. Mackenzie ed., p. 222), and here by Sìleas in calling it “uinnean puinnsein”; “dìnneir” and “gach truinnsear” are merely part of the analogy. The use of Uinein for “Union” (more usually Aonadh) is attested in ML (c. 1775), see Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. 326. Sìleas is somewhat unfair in placing all the blame for the Union on the English, for the Scottish parliament also passed it; it was first presented and energetically promoted by John Erskine, Earl of Mar (Tayler, 1715, p. 186). The Treaty of Union also confirmed that Queen Anne, then reigning, was to be succeeded, if she died heirless, by Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her descendants, and not by James Francis Edward (Hume Brown, Short History, pp. 287, 289).

[TD 130]

V. DO DH’FHEACHD MHORAIR MÀR

This poem is edited from three sources, I, T and GB; it was previously edited from T and GB in BG, p. 125. The title here is taken from GB; all other copies of the poem give it as “Òran air Latha Sliabh an t-Siorraim”. But it is obviously an incitement to battle rather than an account (like nos. VI-VIII) of the Battle of Sheriffmuir, and it is clearly to be dated to the period when the Earl of Mar’s army was being formed for battle in 1715.

John Erskine (1675–1732), Earl of Mar, succeeded to his title in 1689, served in the Scottish Parliament and Privy Council, and sponsored the 1707 Act of Union. In 1711 Queen Anne appointed him Secretary of State for Scotland, but on King George’s accession in 1714 he lost that post and was snubbed by the king. Having had Jacobite leanings and dealings previously (he was called “Bobbing John” because of his frequent changes of allegiance), he left Gravesend, near London, on 2nd August 1715, on a collier and in disguise, landed in Fife and proceeded to Braemar. There he met prominent Jacobite leaders on 21st August, and these included the Earl Marischal, the Marquis of Huntly and Robertson of Struan. A large meeting of Jacobite leaders and supporters, ostensibly a hunting party, was held at Braemar on 27th August, though Mar did not receive his commission as leader of the projected rising till 3rd September. Some 800 people attended this meeting, including Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh, Campbell of Glendaruel (representing Lord Breadalbane), General Alexander Gordon, Mackenzie of Seaforth, the Marquis of Huntly and the Earl Marischal. A further meeting was held at Aboyne on 3rd September to plan the rising, and those attending again included Glengarry, Glendaruel, General Gordon, Huntly, Marischal and perhaps the Earl of Strathmore.

At another large meeting at Braemar on 7th September, Mar raised the standard of James VIII. The fact that the gilt ball fell off the top of the post when the standard was being raised was taken by some as an ill-omen. Afterwards the leaders dispersed to collect their men. Mar marched south from Braemar with an army and took possession of Perth on 14th September, while the Government troops under the Duke of Argyll were encamped at Stirling to ensure that the Jacobites could not cross the Forth (Tayler, 1715, pp. 21-49, 183-192).

[TD 131]

The present poem is thus probably to be dated between September (when the Highland leaders set out to collect their men) and 13th November 1715 (when the Battle of Sheriffmuir took place).

If Watson (BG, p. 295) and Maclean Sinclair (GB, p. 171) were right in saying that stanza 12 is addressed to the Frasers, we could date the poem to the week before the battle, for in that case the Whig leader of the Frasers (line 287) could only be Simon Fraser of Beaufort, and he did not declare himself to be a Whig until 5th November at the earliest (see below).

But line 259 shows that Sìleas expected “Mac Shimidh” (patronymic of the chief of Fraser) to join Mar, and Alexander Fraser of Fraserdale, claiming to be chief, did so, though his men left Perth again on 10th November, when they heard of Simon Fraser’s decision. But it seems somewhat unlikely that Sìleas would refer to Fraserdale as “Mac Shimidh”, and then go on to describe Simon Fraser as “ceann” of the family (line 287). This makes it less likely that st. 12 refers to the Frasers, but I can make no alternative suggestion as to whom Sìleas intended by “a’ bhuidheann ud thall” (line 283). In interpreting thall, Watson says (BG, p. 295) that the poem was composed at Beldornie; while we cannot really be sure of this (see Introduction, Section 3), there is little reason to doubt that it was written in Banffshire; from this viewpoint, thall could indicate several Whig families (such as the Grants of Grant) in addition to the Frasers. It has been suggested (TGSI XLV, p. 102) that the Mackintoshes may be intended here, if the poem was written some considerable time before the battle, when Sìleas would not have known who was likely to rise and who was not. But if we accept that the reference to Mar (line 278) dates the poem to August 1715, at the earliest, then the suggestion becomes untenable, for the chief of the Mackintoshes was already in action on the Jacobite side by that time (A. M. Mackintosh, The Mackintoshes, pp. 292 ff.). There does not seem to be enough evidence to decide who is intended.

Another poem on Mar’s army, ostensibly written before the battle, appears in T, p. 138 (Maclean Sinclair, Glenbard Collection, p. 46).


234. o ’n tìr: this is probably to be interpreted as “from the Highlands (to the Lowlands)”, referring to the departure of the Highland contingents to join Mar at Perth.

238-239. Dòmhnall o ’n Dùn is Sir Donald MacDonald, 11th of Sleat; Iain Lom applied the name Dòmhnall an Dùin to his father, and also to Dòmhnall Gorm Òg, 8th of Sleat (Mackenzie ed., lines 104, 1353). The Dùn referred to is Dùn Tuilm in Trotternish, Skye, the family’s ancestral home; Dòmhnall, 11th, seems to have been the last of the family to live there (Fraser-Mackintosh, Letters of Two Centuries, p. 146). He was born about 1665 and was educated by Martin Martin. He earned the name Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh for his part in the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, and was head of the Sleat MacDonalds from 1692 till his death in 1718 (TGSI XLV, pp. 258 ff.); he is the subject of a poem by Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh (Watson ed., p. 76). He attended the hunting-party held by Mar at Braemar on 27th August 1715, and afterwards collected some 600-800 men to join the MacKenzies and others in attacking the Hanoverian encampment (see below) at Alness, Ross-shire (Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 224). But he was taken ill on the way south to join Mar at Perth, and had to be brought home to Skye before the battle (Nicolson, History of Skye, p. 213).

Sir Donald’s two brothers, James of Oronsay and William, thus became the leaders of the MacDonalds of Sleat at Sheriffmuir, where they took part in the rout of Argyll’s left wing (see Poem no. VI, Notes). James later became the 13th head of the family, and his death is lamented in Poem no. XIII.

242. It is equally possible, as Professor Thomson suggests to me, that the words le cliù are to be read in conjunction with the verb glac—“Grasp with renown the honour you have achieved”.

243. Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh (the subject of Poem no. XIV), 11th chief of the MacDonalds of Glengarry, was apparently grey-haired by now, 26 years after his heroic part in the Battle of Killiecrankie. He had already been married twice before Killiecrankie, and had a son killed there. His second wife was Mary, daughter of Coinneach Mór, 3rd Earl of Seaforth (Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 348). He attended Mar’s meetings at Braemar and Aboyne, after which General Alexander Gordon was sent to raise the Highlanders, and the Glengarry men were the first to join him (Tayler, 1715, pp. 39, 232; Terry, Jacobites and Union, p. 80). Clanranald, and perhaps Keppoch, the Macleans of Mull and some of the Camerons then followed, and with these Gordon

[TD 133]

attacked Fort William, but with little success. On 19th October they “took up a position close to Inveraray, with a view to overawing the Campbells”; they left Inveraray on 25th October (Drummond-Norie, Loyal Lochaber, pp. 149 ff.; Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 422) and arrived on 1st November (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 112, n. 4) at Auchterarder, where they awaited orders from Mar. Glengarry’s own contingent consisted of 500 men, according to Mackenzie (History, p. 348).

Cf. A. M. Mackenzie, Lochaber Bards, p. 40.

248-251. Ailein Mùideartach, Mac Mhic Ailein, 12th chief (Captain) of Clan Ranald, was also known as Ailein Ruadh (SGS XI, p. 246, n. 11) or as Ailein Dearg (Charles Macdonald, Moidart, p. 102). He is probably called “o ’n chuan” because his family territory was maritime, while Keppoch and Glengarry are inland; perhaps also because he spent most of his life in Uist (Macdonald, Moidart, pp. 103, 109). He was born about 1670 (Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 419), or 1673 (Clan Donald II, p. 340) or 1675 (Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes I, p. 11), succeeded to the chiefship in 1686, and took part in the Battle of Killiecrankie, after which he fled with his brother Ranald to France rather than submit to the Government. There he met the exiled King James VII, and joined the French Guards to fight with them against King William and others (Drummond-Norie, Loyal Lochaber, p. 151); it would seem to have been in a battle fought for the French, before he was married, that he received a wound which made it impossible for him to have children (Wodrow, Analecta II, p. 362; cf. GB, p. 171; BG, p. 295). He appears to have returned to Scotland in 1696 (Clan Donald II, p. 341, cf. Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes I, p. 11).

Niall Mac Mhuirich (c. 1637 1726) composed a poem on his birth which begins “Dia bheatha ar ar los, a leinbh” and is preserved in Nat. Lib. MS XLVIII, folio 9b (TGSI XXIX, p. 234; Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 124), and the same poet also composed for him a Welcome to Allan, printed in Rel. Celt. II, p. 286. A poem in E, p. 64 (SO, p. 68) appears to have been addressed to him after he had left home to join the 1715 Rising.

There are said to have been 500 Clanranald men in Mar’s army (Macdonald, Moidart, pp. 100-111), and 900 men of Clanranald and Glengarry combined.

[TD 134]

254. i.e. the MacDonalds, see Celtic Monthly, I, pp. 44-45. Their heather badge is also referred to in line 438.

255. The leader of the Keppoch family, whose territory was mainly Am Bràighe (Brae Lochaber), was Colla, Mac Mhic Raghnaill, Sìleas’ brother, called also Colla na Ceapaich and Colla nam Bó. He was born in 1664, was educated at St Andrews University, became chief on the death of his father, Gilleasbuig, in 1682, and commenced a warlike career (Clan Donald II, pp. 643 ff.; Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, pp. 490 ff.). The name Colla nam Bó derives from his various cattle-raids against the Mackintosh family, who claimed the Keppoch lands. He defeated them at the Battle of Mulroy in 1688, which was the last clan fight, but his feud continued and led him to occupy Inverness in 1689 before proceeding to Killiecrankie. His family’s performance there earned Colla a letter of acknowledgement from James VII in Dublin (Clan Donald II, pp. 644-649).

Colla may have taken part in General Gordon’s attack on Fort William in September 1715 (Clan Donald II, p. 657), but John Sinclair says (Memoirs, p. 266, and Walter Scott agrees with him) that Keppoch took no part in the Battle of Sheriffnuir and only came along afterwards for plunder. In May 1716 he sailed from South Uist to France with Ranald MacDonald, the new chief of Clanranald; he returned to Scotland in April 1719, and died about 1723 (Clan Donald II, pp. 656 ff.; Mackenzie, History, p. 496). His wife was Barbara, sister of Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat (Mackenzie, History, p. 223), and his son Alexander succeeded him (cf. Note on line 32).

Cf. TGSI XLI, p. 168.

259. Mac Choinnich: Uilleam Dubh, 5th Earl of Seaforth, whose seat was at Brahan Castle near Dingwall, was at the Earl of Mar’s gathering at Braemar on 27th August (Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies, p. 219). But afterwards a camp of pro-government troops under the Whig Earl of Sutherland at Alness, Ross-shire, made it prudent for him to remain at home until joined by the men of Sir Donald of Sleat. Then with some 3000 men under him (mainly MacKenzies, MacDonalds, Frasers, Mackinnons, MacCraes and Chisholms), he dispersed the Alness force and proceeded to Perth, where his arrival on 10th November or shortly before encouraged Mar to begin the action that led to the Battle of Sheriffmuir (Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies, pp. 220-

[TD 135]

221; Terry, Jacobites and Union, p. 114; Tayler, 1715, p. 94).

The title of Mac Shimidh, Lord Fraser of Lovat (the family into which John Mackenzie, SO, p. 58, believed Sìleas to have married), was disputed after 1699 between Simon Fraser of Beaufort and Alexander MacKenzie of Prestonhall, who on marrying into the Lovat family called himself Alexander Fraser of Fraserdale; the matter was not finally decided till 1730 (Tayler, 1715, p. 307). Sìleas probably refers here to Fraser of Fraserdale, who led his men with Seaforth to join Mar at Perth. But Simon Fraser of Beaufort declared himself for the government on 5th November, or shortly after (Anderson, Historical Account, p. 140), and when the Frasers under Fraserdale heard this, about 10th November, they left Mar’s camp and returned north before the battle started (Tayler, 1715, pp. 102-103; Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 203).

The chief of the MacLeods (Sìol Tormoid) at this time was Tormod, 22nd chief (1706–1772), but since he was only a child his affairs were being looked after by John MacLeod of Contullich and his brother Alexander, sons of Sir Norman MacLeod of Berneray. The Berneray family were Jacobites, but the MacLeod family as such had no share in the Rising (Macleod, The MacLeods, p. 23). Yet in 1716, Tormod, the chief, was made a Baron by James in recognition of his support for the Rising (Grant, The Macleods, p. 389).

260. The three sources are unanimous about the form of the place-name—Srath Chuailte. It has not been identified, and Watson (BG, p. 295) suggests reading Srath Suardail instead, since this is the usual designation of the Mackinnons, and still fits the rhyming pattern. But perhaps Srath Chuailte is an old place-name now forgotten. The parish of Strath in Skye, which includes Srath Suardail, is said by Forbes (Place-names of Skye, p. 414) to have been called “Strath of the Coolins” by Ossian, but Forbes does not give a Gaelic form, nor does he state his source. Timothy Pont, who made a survey of Skye between 1580 and 1600, mentions a place (Macfarlane’s Geographical Collections, II, pp. 582-583) which he calls Strath Houlin, Strathoulyn or Strath of Hollyi, and which appears to be near Loch Ainort and opposite the island of Scalpay. “Again within 2 myle to Strathoulyn is Skenadyr”, he says, probably referring to Sgianadan on the north coast of Strath parish.

There were 150 Mackinnons at Sheriffmuir under their chief,

[TD 136]

Iain Dubh (1682–1756), who was also out in 1745 (Mackinnon, Clan Fingon, pp. 37 ff.). They followed MacDonald of Sleat to join up with Seaforth’s force.

261. Two hundred of the Chisholms of Strathglass were led at Sheriffmuir by their 21st chief, Ruairidh an Àigh (1697–1767), who is said to have been married to Elizabeth, daughter of Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh. They joined Seaforth and distinguished themselves at the battle (Mackenzie, History of the Chisholms, pp. 59 ff.; Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes, I, pp. 172-174).

263. An Coileach: the Cock of the North, George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon (c. 1650–1716), for whose lands Sìleas’ husband had acted as bailie (Introduction, Section 3). Gordon had defended Edinburgh Castle against the Williamites in 1689 (Bulloch, 1st Duke, pp. 79 ff.), and he was imprisoned in the Castle when the new Jacobite outbreak of 1715 was expected; he remained there and in prison at Leith till his death (Tayler, 1715, p. 200; Bulloch, 1st Duke, p. 105), and this is probably the captivity referred to here. He was represented at the battle by his son, the Marquis of Huntly.

Stanzas 8 and 9 are written on the analogy of cock-fighting, which became especially popular in Scotland after 1705 (Smout, History of the Scottish People, plate opposite p. 249). Sgoilearan in line 264 may refer to the fact that fighting-cocks are best trained by being taught in “classes” (Pierce Egan’s Book of Sports, p. 148), though it could also refer to the fact that cock-fighting was a common practice among schoolboys. Or we might consider substituting sgollachain, “unfledged birds” (Dwelly). The coileir in line 268 may be the ring of feathers which stands out on the neck of some cocks, at least, when fighting (illustration as frontispiece to The Cocker, by W. Sketchley, Gent.). The word fùidse in line 265 seems to have particular reference to fighting-cocks, though it can apply to cowards in general, as in line 317 (see Dwelly; BG, p. 368); the same is true of its English equivalent fugie, which the SND does not attest earlier than 1777. The poca in line 266 is probably the bag in which a cock is brought to and from the fighting pit (Egan, p. 152).

272. Mac Cailein: John Campbell (1680–1743), 2nd Duke of Argyll, who led the Hanoverian army at Sheriffmuir (Tayler, 1715, pp. 106 ff.; Rel. Celt. II, p. 311).

273-276. Alexander Robertson (c. 1670–1749), 17th of

[TD 137]

Struan, took part in battle as a Jacobite in 1689, 1715 and 1745. He had fled to France after Killiecrankie (1689) and returned to Scotland after the passing of Queen Anne’s Act of Indemnity in 1703 (Drummond-Norie, Loyal Lochaber, p. 141). He met the Earl of Mar at Braemar on 21st August 1715, and his 203 men (according to Mar’s estimate) were the first Highlanders to reach the Jacobite army in October (Tayler, 1715, pp. 36, 62). Twelve stanzas of an Oran do Thighearna Shruthain are preserved in ML MS 503; see also Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. 383. Alexander’s own poems (in English) were published in Edinburgh in 1750, and again in the History & Martial Atchievements of the Robertsons, c. 1775; they include short “Epitaphs” on the Earl of Mar, Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh and Ailein Mùideartach. The distinctive pipe tunes of the Robertsons are listed by Reid, Clan Robertson, p. 91.

274. In the present collection the words which rhyme with Fraing are beann/deann (here), àm/cheann/Spàinnt (lines 455-461), and thall (line 668).

277. Not all the Campbells joined the Hanoverian side with the Argyll family in 1715; many of the Campbells of Breadalbane were with Mar (Tayler, 1715, p. 109), and their deeds earn mention by Sìleas in lines 480, 510-517. Cf. TGSI XLI, p. 167.

280. A list of 59 Forbeses who were Jacobites in 1715 is given by the Taylers, Jacobites in 1715, pp. 74-89. Some of them were Mar’s own retainers at his estate of Kildrummy (which later came into the hands of Sìleas’ son, James, see Introduction, Section 4), and this is probably why the Forbeses as a whole are represented as being with Mar himself. Mar’s bailie at Kildrummy, Black Jock Forbes of Inverernan, whose son seems to have been married to one of Sìleas’ daughters (Introduction, Section 4), was out in 1715 with other members of his family (Tayler, House of Forbes, p. 456).

But there were other Forbeses, not tenants of Mar, in the Rising, notably Alexander Forbes, 4th Lord Pitsligo, who was Mar’s cousin (Tayler, House of Forbes, pp. 348-349), and James Forbes, later 16th Lord Forbes, son of William, the Whig 13th Lord (ibid., p. 249). Duncan Forbes, later 5th of Culloden, was on the Government side.

288-292. This stanza is omitted in GB. It may be addressed to the subjects of st. 12 (whom we cannot identify with certainty, see above), or perhaps to Catholic Highlanders in general. The

[TD 138]

effect seems to be that the subjects are blamed for standing by and allowing Presbyterianism to get the upper hand over the churches which had bishops. Sìleas may intend the Catholic Church here, her own church and that of James VII and VIII, or she may be harking back to the old struggle between Presbyterianism and Episcopalianism which dominated the reigns of the Charleses.

293. Duncan MacPherson of Cluny succeeded his brother in 1666 as 16th chief of his family, and he appears to have spent much of his career in trying to avoid taking sides in battles. He refused to join Mackintosh at the Battle of Mulroy in 1688 against Colla na Ceapaich, but after the battle he rescued Mackintosh from the MacDonalds. In 1689, 250 of his men fought for James VII at Killiecrankie, but Duncan was not committed (Cheyne-Macpherson, Chiefs of Clan Macpherson, pp. 21, 25-26). He was an old man in 1715 (he died in 1722), and once again, though some of his men were present at Sheriffmuir (see line 418), he did not come out himself, cf. Fraser-Mackintosh, Antiquarian Notes II, p. 350. “Ma dh’imich thu null” here shows that Sìleas was doubtful as to whether he would come out or not.

303. Lunnainn nan cleòc: cf. TGSI XXVII, p. 376, st. 6.


VI. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (1)

This poem is edited from two sources, I (printed in AM, p. 81) and S (copied in Me, p. 278). I ascribes the poem to Sìleas, but S simply says it is “le mnaoi uasail àraid”.

The poem begins (stt. 1-2) with what is apparently a false account of the Battle of Sheriffmuir, which the poet refuses to accept (st. 3), and this is followed by a more acceptable account, on the basis of which Sìleas praises the brave and reproaches the cowardly, and laments (stt. 7-10) the principal leaders who were killed.

A short account of the battle may be found in the Taylers’ 1715: The Story of the Rising, pp. 94 ff. The Earl of Mar’s army, encouraged by the arrival of Mackenzie of Seaforth and his men, set out southwards from Perth on 10th November with over 12,000 men, intending ultimately to cross the Forth. The foot-soldiers encamped that night at Auchterarder, and the following day General Gordon and his men, with the horse under John Sinclair, Master of Sinclair, were ordered to take

[TD 139]

Dunblane; but they found that the Hanoverian army under John Campbell, Duke of Argyll, had already advanced from Stirling and taken the town. Argyll then formed his men near Sheriffmuir, north-east of Dunblane, where he spent the night of 12th November, and the Jacobites encamped three miles away at Kinbuck.

Argyll’s men began to move about 11 A.M. on Sunday, 13th November. Mar’s left wing attacked but was outflanked by the Hanoverian cavalry from Argyll’s right. After a hard fight of three hours, the Highlanders on the Jacobite left (notably the Camerons) and their supporting troops from the second line were driven back for some three miles as far as the river Allan, and many of them were drowned. But the centre of the Jacobite army, which was commanded by Mar himself and which included the MacDonalds, Campbells, Grants and Macleans, drove Argyll’s left wing back almost as far as Stirling. Thus both left wings were defeated; Mar’s right wing, which completely outflanked Argyll’s army, never took part in the action.

When Mar heard that his left had been defeated he led his men back to Sheriffmuir, but gave no orders to attack what remained of Argyll’s army. He even allowed Argyll’s cavalry, returning from the rout of the Jacobite left wing, to pass unmolested. Both armies remained on the field till nearly dark, and then went off the way they had come.

In addition to the three poems on the battle given here, I have noted two others: one in GS20, p. 20 (also in ML MS 169, and in the Maclean MS, p. 412), and the other in The Highlander 20/7/1878, p. 3 (TGSI VIII, p. 118), entitled Cumha Do Cheathrar Iain na h-Alba a thuit ann am Blar Sliabh-an-t-Siorraim, 1815, beginning “Tha Uilleam cliuiteach an diugh fo chas”, by Coinneach Mac Rath of Lochalsh, who was present at the battle at the age of 70. This is the poem called Latha Blàr an t-Siorra (by John MacRae) mentioned in A. Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies, p. 221. Cf. also CT, p. 205. A few lines on “Monadh an tSiorraim” in a version of the pseudo-Ossianic Laoidh an Tàilleoir (Rel. Celt. I, pp. 163-164; Campbell, Leabhar na Feinne, p. 202; BG, p. 118) elicit the opinion of Diarmaid Ó Duibhne (alleged ancestor of the Campbells) that the presence of Fionn and his Fiana at the battle would have altered the outcome. There are also a reel (Celtic Monthly II, p. 160) and a pìobaireachd (Collin-

[TD 140]

son, Traditional and National Music, p. 188) entitled The Battle of Sheriffmuir. Songs in English on the battle are to be found in Hogg’s Jacobite Relics, especially Vol. I, pp. 149-152 and Vol. II, pp. 1-31.


310-311. Clan Donald was in the centre of the front line of Mar’s army, while the MacKenzies were in the second line (Tayler, 1715, p. 98). Clan Donald were in the victorious charge on Argyll’s left, while the MacKenzies appear to have fallen victim to Argyll’s victorious right. When the charge of the centre under Mar began, Mar found that cavalry was necessary to pursue the fleeing horse of Argyll’s left wing, and he called up the cavalry which had been stationed at the left of the second line, thus leaving his left front line virtually unsupported by cavalry to meet Argyll’s dragoons (Tayler, 1715, p. 101; Petrie, Jacobite Movement, p. 188; Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 215). The left front line seems to have been supported by the foot of the second line, which included the MacKenzies, the Gordons and the Atholl men, but these were all routed (W. C. Mackenzie, History of the Outer Hebrides, p. 400; Tayler, 1715, p. 98). Seaforth himself, however, did not lead his men but remained with his horse (Mackenzie, History of the Outer Hebrides, p. 402); Sinclair says (Memoirs, p. 232): “But of all engaged, Seaforth acted the scandalousest part; who, in place of putting himself at the head of his Clan, as all agreed, stood off in the rear, on some little rising ground, with fourtie scoundrells, on horseback, with him, I can’t say a cool spectator of the fate of his countrie”. Letters written by Seaforth in 1716 (Skeet, Papers, pp. 31-33) show that he was well aware of the reputation his performance at Sheriffmuir had brought him. He later took part in the Rising of 1719. Two poems to him by his own bard are printed in TGSI XLV, pp. 186-191, and a Failte Uilleam Duibh is given by “Fionn”, Martial Music, p. 24, TGSI IX, p. 25.

It is clear that Sìleas’ information is, as she tells us, wrong in saying that the MacDonalds and the MacKenzies fell together on the Muir.

312. This line seems to be a play on the meaning of “Thug … as a chasan”, which usually implies “took to his heels”, but which can also mean “withdrew his foot-soldiers”. Alexander Gordon (c. 1678–1728), 5th Marquis of Huntly and later 2nd Duke of Gordon, was the son of the first Duke and

[TD 141]

appears to have been a somewhat reluctant Jacobite, see the account of his part in the rising in Tayler, 1715, pp. 199 ff. Poems on the battle, whether in Gaelic or in English (including nos. VII and VIII here) agree that Huntly fled from Sheriffmuir:

Traitor Huntly soon gave way,
Seaforth, St. Clair, and a’,
Willie.
(F.S.A. (Scot.), Sheriffmuir, p. 49)

<gai>Gun d’rinn Clann Dòmhnaill an dligheadh,
Is theich Diùc Ghòrdain as na cianaibh.<eng>
(BG, p. 118)

Huntly was aggrieved that he was not chosen to lead the Rising (Tayler, 1715, p. 38), which many of the Highlanders also expected him to do (Bulloch, 2nd Duke, p. 21). He contacted Argyll about surrender terms even before the battle, and was among the first to submit to the Government afterwards (Tayler, pp. 207, 113-116). The historians are less certain about his part in the battle than the poets and balladeers were; Huntly did give orders for the cavalry of the left to join in the pursuit of Argyll’s left (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 215), but throughout the battle he seems to have played safe (Tayler, 1715, p. 103); we have no real evidence that he fled.

Huntly’s foot, 1200 men, were in the second line at the battle under the command of John Gordon of Glenbuchat; some 200 of them, probably affected by Huntly’s lack of enthusiasm, deserted just before the battle, and the remainder were routed (Tayler, pp. 62, 103, 206, 238-239; Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 130, n. 2; Skelton and Bulloch, Gordons under Arms, no. 2053). The number of Huntly’s horse is given by Mar as 400 (Tayler, p. 62), many of them being rather poor (p. 205), and they took part in the rout of Argyll’s left.

315. This is the only reference we have to a son of Sìleas taking part in the battle; the reference might be to her son James, if, as has been suggested, he was a member of the Hanoverian army, if not actually present at Sheriffmuir under Argyll (see Introduction, Section 4). Otherwise we should note that the reference occurs in the context of statements which are later contradicted, and we might surmise that one of her sons was among Huntly’s men at the battle, which might be expected since the Duke of Gordon was the head of their

[TD 142]

family, and Sìleas’ husband had been his factor (Introduction, Section 3). Yet neither the Taylers (Jacobites in 1715) nor Skelton & Bulloch (Gordons under Arms) list any of the family as being out in 1715. Since the mention of a son of Sìleas is not made again in the second, more acceptable, account of the battle (see line 332 n.), a possible solution, for which I have no evidence, is that one of her sons was among the 200 “Strathdoun and Glenlivet men” (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 204) who deserted before the battle (see previous note). Camdell is in Strathdoun (Strathavon), and this suggestion would have to imply that Sìleas and her family still lived there in 1715 (cf. Introduction, Section 3).

316. Cf. Dwelly, s.v. greadan. This passage presumably refers to the Marquis of Huntly.

332. This line probably means that a fresh report of the result of the battle reached Sìleas early on the day after the first report arrived. The heroes of the succeeding three stanzas are presumably the MacDonalds (“mo chàirdibh”, line 334).

336. Cf. Dwelly, s.v. deannal.

356-363. Ailein, Mac Mhic Ailein, Captain of Clanranald, on whom see line 248 n., was mortally wounded during the rout of Argyll’s left wing, when some of Argyll’s fleeing foot-soldiers were forced by a troop of horse under Lord Torphichen to rally temporarily (Tayler, 1715, p. 100). The story is well known of how his followers hesitated on seeing him fall, but were spurred on by Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh who shouted: “Revenge! Revenge today, and mourning tomorrow!” or words to that effect (e.g. A. Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 424), whereupon the rout continued. Carmichael (Celtic Review VI, p. 280) gives the original Gaelic form of these words as: “Buillean an diugh, tuiream am màireach, a Chlann-domhnuill!”

It is said that Ailein, before the battle, had a presentiment of his death (C. Macdonald, Moidart, pp. 109 ff.), and there is also a tradition (Celtic Review VI, p. 281; W. C. Mackenzie, History of the Outer Hebrides, p. 402 n.) that Ailein “was shot at Sheriffmuir by one of his own men, who bore him a grudge, and who in view of the belief that the young chief bore a charmed life, used a crooked sixpence to compass his end”. He was taken from the battle to Drummond Castle, near Crieff, the seat of the Earl of Perth, and there he died the

[TD 143]

following day; he was buried at nearby Innerpeffray (Clan Donald III, p. 233).

Ailein’s death was sincerely mourned by many in the Highlands. It is said to have been in regard to him that the saying arose among the Clanranald people: “Co ris a théid mi ’g am ghearan, ’s gun Mac Mhic Ailein am Mùideart?” (Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs 153.7). A lament by Niall Mac Mhuirich for his wounds, before his death was known, appears in E, p. 73, and a lament by the same poet on his death in E, p. 75 (= BG, p. 141); see also E, pp. 67, 70; SO, p. 69; Rel. Celt. II, p. 248; ML MS 141; TGSI XXIII, p. 276; K, p. 17. The well-known refrain Tha tighinn fodham éirigh is often attributed to Ailein himself after he was wounded (cf. Celtic Monthly II, p. 8; E, p. 113).

358. seobhag sùil-ghorm: cf. line 814.

364-371. John Lyon, 5th Earl of Strathmore, was only 25 years old in 1715 (Tayler, Old Chevalier, p. 60) and he may have been present among the planners of the Rising at Aboyne on 3rd September (Tayler, 1715, p. 38). He led a section of the troops which, under Brigadier Mackintosh of Borlum, were sent across the Forth by boat from Fife, and which attacked Leith, joined the southern Jacobites and marched into England, where they were defeated at Preston on 13th November (see Tayler, 1715, Chapter VIII). Strathmore’s detachment, however, failed to get across the Forth and returned to the main army (ibid. p. 76). At Sheriffmuir the Earl was in command of a battalion on the left resisting Argyll’s cavalry, and was killed in an attempt to rally his men (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 226). One account says he was killed by a dragoon whose life he had spared (Petrie, Jacobite Movement, p. 189). The Taylers considered him “the only prominent Jacobite leader killed” (Old Chevalier, p. 68). Having lost their leader, Strathmore’s men left Mar immediately after the battle (Tayler, 1715, p. 503).

His mother was Elizabeth Stanhope (1663–1723), daughter of Philip, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield (Paul, Scots Peerage VIII, p. 304). When James, the Chevalier, arrived in Scotland in January 1716, she lodged him for two days at Glamis (Taylor, Old Chevalier, p. 82). The Scots Peerage adds (p. 304): “She was a careful wife and mother, ample evidence of both facts being found in her household book 1706–24, still preserved at Glamis”.

372. The most distinguished Iain Grant present at Sheriff-

[TD 144]

muir was Iain a’ Chragain (1657–1736), 6th chief of Glenmoriston, who with his men followed Glengarry and joined General Gordon’s force about 20th September 1715, taking part in the “siege” of Inveraray (see line 243 n.), cf. Terry, Jacobites and Union, p. 99. At Sheriffmuir he is said to have saved the life of Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh when the latter’s trousers fell off in battle (A. Sinclair, Grants of Glenmoriston, p. 25). But unless Sìleas was misinformed he cannot be one of the Iain Grants intended here, for he survived the battle.

Since the Grants of Glenmoriston were attached to Glengarry’s contingent there is not much detailed information available about their part in the battle, and I have failed to identify the two Iains mentioned here, or even to name possibilities. They must almost certainly have been Glenmoriston Grants, since the other main branch of the family, the Grants of Grant, were Whigs; 800 of them took part with Simon Fraser of Beaufort in the recapture of Inverness on 10th November (Fraser, Chiefs of Grant, Vol. I, p. 350).

373. fhuair: there was a frost on the night before the Battle of Sheriffmuir, which hardened the marshy ground to the left of Mary’s army and made possible Argyll’s cavalry assault on Mar’s left (Tayler, 1715, p. 99).

374. Cf. “’S ioma spealp do dhuin’ uasal / Bha mu’n cuairt duit an lath’ ud”, in a poem on the Battle of Mulroy, T, p. 143.


VII. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (2)

This is the only poem in the present collection for which I have seen an author other than Sìleas Nighean Mhic Raghnaill suggested. As given here it is a direct copy (with a few spelling changes) of the only complete text I have, that of Maclean Sinclair in GS20, p. 15, where it is ascribed to Sìleas. The content of the poem probably indicates a MacDonald author, but the ascription to Sìleas is notably late, as the text is (1894), and is totally unsubstantiated. Some further reasons for doubting the authorship of Sìleas are given by Maclean in TGSI XLV, pp. 104-105. Since it is also doubtful whether or not Sìleas was the author of Poem no. VIII (see Notes below), it seems possible that in the cases of these two, collectors have ascribed anonymous poems to her simply because she is known to have composed other poems (V and VI) relating to the Battle of Sheriffmuir.

[TD 145]

I have made no major changes in the text of GS20, for I have no evidence on which to base any changes, though some are obviously desirable. The abrupt beginning of the text may indicate that it is not complete; stanza 2 has two lines too many; two different chorus quatrains are given, each of them only once, leaving five stanzas not followed by a chorus. Perhaps the first chorus is intended to be repeated after each stanza from 1 to 5, which deal with those defeated in the battle, and the second chorus after stt. 6 and 7, which deal with Clan Donald.

The following version of the first chorus plus st. 2 appears with an English translation in CT, p. 242 (copied in MB, p. 23):

<gai>
Fonn:
Ho ro agus ho! ho ro an teagal!
Mile mallachd nar deigh,
Gu leir o’n theich sibh!

Firé, fairé, Lochial!
’S clisg thair sliabh do bhratach!
’M bu chleachda dhith riamh
Sealtain fiatadh ’s sgapadh?
Ob, ob, na “fir-mhor”
O Shrath-lochaidh bhradain!

<eng>

Campbell ascribes the poem of which this is part to Domhnull Mac Raonuill, his own maternal grandfather (cf. CT, p. 226). This Domhnull, called Donald MacIain in Clan Donald II, p. 223, led the Glencoe family in the rising of 1745 (cf. CT, p. 237).

Campbell goes on to say of the above verse (CT, pp. 242-243): “This verse is a parody on the corresponding verse of a song then recent, in which a Cameron, rather fulsomely, perhaps, praises the ‘fir-mhor’ of these parts of the clan district. The poem on Sheriffmuir has never been published, but stray verses of it are to be found in the districts of the clans who distinguished themselves by running away, as well as in those of the clans who behaved as usual: for, so far from being rude and barbarous was the Highland warrior of past ages, that he never took offence at anything humourous or satirical, of which he himself or his friends or clan were the

[TD 146]

subject. … This singular battle was literally regarded as a burlesque by both parties. However, nobody doubted or could doubt the patriotism or heroism either of an Erskine, a Gordon, a Cameron, or a Mackenzie. The clans could, therefore, afford to laugh, and did laugh heartily, at Domhnull Mac Raonuill’s humourous description of the blunders of ‘Latha Sliabh an t-Shirradh’.”

The fact that Campbell names the author of the alleged parodied song as a Cameron and gives only a verse dealing with the Camerons, while the complete poem deals with many others, might suggest that Campbell’s identification of the author need not be relied on too heavily.

If he is correct in saying that the poem is a parody, then we obviously have no evidence for its date.

A somewhat similar poem appears in The Highland Monthly, III (1891), p. 274.


388-393. On the part played by MacKenzie of Seaforth at the battle see line 310 n. There is no evidence for the distance he ran from the battle, or that he ran at all.

400-401. Lines similar to these appear in a version of Pìobaireachd Dhòmhnaill Dhuibh (An Gaidheal, IV, 1875, p. 18), which is associated with the first Battle of Inverlochy (1431).

400-407. Sir Eoghann Dubh (1629–1719), 17th Cameron of Lochiel, was too old and unwell to take part in the battle, and his men were led there by his son John (Mackenzie, History of the Camerons, pp. 204-205). They bore the brunt of Argyll’s attack on the left and were defeated and driven back in spite of having rallied six times (Tayler, 1715, p. 99). John Cameron’s own account of the battle is printed by William Mackay in TGSI XXVI, pp. 60 ff., and also in his Sidelights on Highland History, pp. 437 ff., where this stanza is quoted. John’s brother Allan was one of the few companions of king James when he arrived in December, and John says (TGSI XXVI, p. 73) that it was his sister who sent a message to General Gordon’s detachment, on its way to take Dunblane before the battle, that Argyll had already captured the town (cf. line 462 n.).

The places mentioned here are all in the Cameron lands; Eoghann Cameron of Erracht in Gleann Laoigh was among those killed at the battle (Mackenzie, History, p. 318).

410. On the Gordons’ part in the battle see line 312 n.

452. cinneadh an rìgh: the Stewarts were kinsfolk of the

[TD 147]

royal house of Stuart. Robert Stewart of Appin (the subject of st. 5) brought 250 men to the battle (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 106; J. Stewart, Stewarts of Appin, p. 122), and they were placed, according to Maclean Sinclair (Clan Gillean, p. 230), to the left of the Camerons in the front line, where they were defeated.

414-417. The Mackinnons, though they came to Mar’s army under the command of MacDonald of Sleat (see line 260 n.), were with the Camerons on the left when the battle began, as John Cameron himself tells us (TGSI XXVI, p. 74), and were routed. “Clann Fhionghuin nam faochag” is a common name for the Mackinnons in Skye (Nicolson, Gaelic Proverbs, 384.10; Forbes, Place-names of Skye, pp. 413-415). The Highlanders threw off their plaids on going into battle (see line 472), and those who were defeated were unable to return for them; the Gordons said they could not fight again after Sheriffmuir because they had lost their clothes (Tayler, 1715, p. 102, n. 1).

418. The Atholl Highlanders under William Murray (1689–1746), Marquis of Tullibardine, who was also out in 1719 and 1745, were in the defeated second line at Sheriffmuir (Tayler, 1715, p. 98). The Marquis’ brothers, Lord George and Lord Charles Murray, and his uncle William, Lord Nairn, were also involved in the rising, though not at Sheriffmuir. But his father, the Duke of Atholl, was on the government side (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 255).

Some of the MacPhersons, the men of Badenoch, joined Mar’s army in spite of the fact that their chief was neutral (see line 293 n.). Many of them joined the MacGregors under Rob Roy (1671–1734), who kept his followers aloof from the Sheriffmuir action; they were met several miles from the battlefield by the fleeing men of Mar’s left wing (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 233; TGSI XXVI, p. 74). But John Cameron (TGSI XXVI, p. 74) tells us that some of the MacPhersons, like the Mackinnons, joined up with the Camerons at the battle, and these are probably the “fir Bhàideanaich” here referred to.

426-433. Line 433 is unfair to Robert Stewart of Appin, who in fact brought 250 men to join General Gordon’s contingent for Mar’s army (see line 412 n.). Robert succeeded to the chiefship of Appin before 1685, and joined Dundee in 1689. In 1695 the Government appointed him Commissioner of

[TD 148]

Supply for Argyllshire, and this appointment was renewed by Queen Anne’s parliament in 1704 (Stewart, Stewarts of Appin, p. 122). Lines 428-431 may be a direct reference to a poem which survives in ML MS 122 (c. 1775, cf. Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 306) and is printed in TGSI XXII, p. 173, under the title: “Comhradh (Agallamh) edir Banrighin Anna agus Tighearna na h-Appuinn Le M’Dhonuill Dhail-an-eas”. In this, Robert is represented as going to London to visit his close friend (and kinswoman) Queen Anne (1702–1714), and promising his help to restore her half-brother James to the throne. (Anne does, in fact, on some occasions at least, seem to have considered James her rightful successor, cf. Tayler, Old Chevalier, pp. 45, 49.) Anne says to Robert (st. 4):

<gai>Innis domh ciod tha thu sireadh,
Gheabh thu gun philleadh gun spairne;
’S leat airgead is òr r’a iomairt
’S leat ceannas-cinneadh nan Gaoidheal:
Is leomsa sin do thaobh mo bhreatha,
Cha bhi mi ga chleith air bhar gràsaibh.<eng>

To which Robert replies (st. 5):

<gai>Togaidh mi féin cuig ceud deug dhiubh
Nach bith ’m Breatuinn féin an àicheadh;
Bhios dìleas dhuibh, ’s mis air an toiseach,
Ged rachadh sibh chogadh re ’m brathair.<eng>

Robert is represented (st. 9) as being accompanied there by “mac peathar fir Dhail ’n eas”, but Clan Donald (III, p. 217) names no sister of Alexander MacDonald, 3rd of Dalness, who was chief from shortly after 1701 till 1726.

It has also been suggested (TGSI XLV, pp. 104-105) that this stanza is addressed to Rob Roy MacGregor (1671–1734), whom the name Raibeart nam Bó would fit very well, since the Stewarts of Appin have already been mentioned, but I can find no trace of an event in Rob Roy’s life which would explain the stanza.

434-441. Cf. line 356, note.

437. triath: this must be the Captain of Clanranald, whose fall at the battle is otherwise only referred to here in lines 443-445 (see lines 356-363, note).

VIII. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (3)

This poem is a composite of two versions: ML MS 124, which is the only source for st. 7, and T, p. 302, which is the only source for stt. 4, 6 and 8. In st. 5 the two versions differ considerably and I follow T here; ML has two lines in this stanza which do not appear in T (see Sources and Readings). A translation of the ML version into English appears in ML MS 249, and a very free translation of T into English is given by Duncan Campbell, Lairds of Glenlyon, p. 233. Stt. 8 and 9 appear in the reverse order in T, but the present order, used in Campbell’s translation, seems more suitable. ML makes no ascription; T ascribes the poem to Sìleas.

As well as giving an account of the battle, the poem expresses hope for a further, more decisive, battle, cf. Poem no. IX. The final line shows that it was written before James arrived in Scotland, i.e. before the end of 1715.

As Maclean points out in TGSI XLV, p. 103, much of this poem sounds like the work of a participant or an eye-witness, and on this score we might be justified in deciding that Sìleas was not the author (cf. Poem no. VII, Notes).


457. James Francis Edward, James VIII, had declared his intention of landing in Scotland as early as October 1714 (see Poem no. IV, Notes), but he did not leave France till 16th December 1715 (Tayler, Old Chevalier, p. 75).

460. Sìleas obviously believed that Sheriffmuir was not the end of the rising, and this is the burden of Poem no. IX, cf. especially lines 594-595. So also some of those who fought in 1715 were still in 1716 hoping for a more decisive battle (Skeet, Papers, pp. 20-21).

462-469. Sinclair, in his Memoirs, p. 203, says: “The first day’s [i.e. Thursday 10th November] marche we of the horse cantooned about Dinnen [i.e. Dunning?], and the foot in and about Auchterarduch”. T reads “air uachdar Ardacha” in line 462, and this form may be due to confusion with the camp which Mar had made in mid-October at the old Roman camp of Ardoch, some miles west of Auchterarder (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 132; Tayler, 1715, p. 78).

Sinclair narrates (pp. 203-204) how the army were paraded “in Auchterarduch moor” before dawn on Saturday 12th

[TD 150]

November, and how General Alexander Gordon was given a troop to advance and take Dunblane. As well as Sinclair himself and his horse, this troop consisted of “Sir Donald MacDonald’s, Captain of Clan Ronald’s, Glengarie’s, Glencoe’s follouings, all MacDonalds, Bredalbins, the MacCleans, the Camerons, Steuart of Apins, and the few that were left of Huntlie’s Strathdoun and Glenlivet men, who had not deserted, for the greatest part of them had gone home”. About three o’clock in the afternoon this troop met a lame boy who had been sent out from Dunblane to tell them that Argyll’s army was already marching northwards through the town. They proceeded a further mile until it grew dark, and then encamped at Kinbuck, “a little hollow, hard by, on the river side, where there were two little farme-houses and corn-yards” (Sinclair, p. 204), and there the main army joined them. Sinclair does not tell us that the corn in the yards was burned, and the reason for this is not clear. Perhaps it was to make more room for the army in the very confined space of Kinbuck: Sinclair tells us that he himself broke down some dry-stone walls in order to make room. Or it may have been done in order to reduce the amount of cover for the enemy (TGSI XLV, p. 103). Perhaps a better reason is given in Duncan Campbell’s translation of this poem (Lairds of Glenlyon, p. 233)

But the stacks of corn so peerless
Fed the flames to keep us warm!

470-477. At 6 A.M. on Sunday, 13th November, Mar’s army came out of the hollow of Kinbuck and was drawn up on the plain above; at sunrise they saw a reconnaissance party of Argyll’s men on high ground about a mile to the south (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 209). Two thousand Highlanders under General Gordon and four squadrons of horse under the Earl Marischal and Lord Drummond were sent to take possession of the high ground. Sinclair says that “never people marched so fast as they did up to the top of that rising ground”—and nastily adds: “I expected to see them come as fast doun as they went up” (p. 214). By the time the main army reached the high ground Argyll’s army were already advancing to meet them (p. 216).

472. The Highlanders took off their plaids before going into battle, and those who were in the ill-fated left wing never returned to pick them up again. Argyll’s men returned to the

[TD 151]

field the following day and collected them, thus gaining the technical victory of the battle (Tayler, 1715, p. 102). Compare the tradition of Blàr Léine (“Blàr nan Léine”) fought in 1544, Celtic Magazine, VI, pp. 89-94.

477. gòrsaid: ML has goiseid, translated in ML MS 249 as “periwigs”. Cf. gosaid in the source text of line 616.

478-481. Mar’s own account names the Highland leaders who took part in the advance of his right centre: “Sir Donald MacDonald’s Brothers, Glengary, Captain of Clan-Ranald, Sir John Maclean, Glenco, Campbell of Glenlyon, Colonel of Broadalbin’s” (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 130, n. 2). Sir John Maclean of Duart (1670–1716) had landed in Ireland with James VII in 1689 and then returned to fight at Killiecrankie. With 400 men he took part in the attack on Fort William in September 1715, and in the “siege” of Inveraray. It is said that only six Macleans were killed at Sheriffmuir (Maclean Sinclair, Clan Gillean, pp. 219-221, 229, 232). Sir John died at Fochabers during the retreat of Mar’s army (Tayler, 1715, p. 169), and was lamented in a poem published in SO, p. 70.

Some 500 of the Campbells of Breadalbane, led by John Campbell of Glenlyon (d. 1746) and Colin Campbell of Glendaruel, joined Mar’s army, but many others were induced not to rise (Tayler, 1715, p. 25; cf. line 512 n.). The Breadalbane banner (called the Yellow Banner by Campbell, Lairds of Glenlyon, p. 231) was mainly yellow and black (cf. Johnston, Heraldry of the Campbells, I, plate opposite p. 64).

486-493. This stanza differs considerably from the form of it given in ML, where it seems to be implied that the names mentioned (apart from Seaforth) are those of the successful leaders. Here they are united by having been defeated in the battle (cf. TGSI XLV, p. 104). On the part played by the Marquis of Huntly see line 312 n.; on Seaforth line 310 n.; on Lochiel line 400 n.; on Stewart of Appin line 412 n. Alexander Robertson of Struan (on whom see line 273 n.) and his men were in the second line at Sheriffmuir (Tayler, 1715, p. 98), but there is some disagreement as to what befell them. W. C. Mackenzie (History of Outer Hebrides, p. 400) states that the whole of the second line was put to flight, and this seems to be the general view, and the view of the poet here; but Campbell (Lairds of Glenlyon, p. 128) thinks he took part in the victorious advance against Argyll’s left. He is said to have

[TD 152]

been taken prisoner twice during the encounter (Reid, Clan Robertson, p. 47). An Slios Garbh is the southern shore of Loch Rannoch, where Struan lived (BG, p. 295).

Probably the hope expressed in lines 492-493 for greater success in the next battle is in connection only with Lochiel, Stewart and Struan, who (unlike Huntly and Seaforth) fought well before being defeated.

494-501. Alasdair Dubh seems to have become the effective leader of Clan Donald at the battle after the fall of Ailein Mùideartach (see lines 356-363, note).

498. Compare the following stanza from a poem by Iain Dubh Mac Iain Mhic Ailein (fl. 1700):

<gai>Ach a Sheumais Oig Stiubhart,
Bha comhstri mu d’ chrùnadh,
Chaill thu ball a thaobh cùlaobh do sgéithe.<eng>
(MC p. 64)

The reference is to Aonghas, Lord Macdonell, 9th of Glengarry.

502-509. The part played in the Rising by George Keith (1693–1778), 10th Earl Marischal, is summarised by the Taylers, 1715, pp. 221 ff. He attended Mar’s meetings at Braemar and Aboyne and then proclaimed James king in Aberdeen, where he had a complete Jacobite magistracy elected. He joined Mar’s army on 7th October with 300 horse and 500 foot, and the presence of his horse greatly helped the Highlanders in their pursuit of Argyll’s left. He was wounded at the battle (Tayler, 1715, p. 103). Later he took part in the Battle of Glenshiel (1719); his brother, James Francis Edward Keith, also took part in both battles (Tayler, 1715, p. 229).

The text (ML) of line 509 reads: “Gu’n deach’ thu ’m brangis …”, but since this seems out of keeping with the first six lines of the stanza I have changed it to “Gun deach e …”, believing that the reference is to the “hound and the long-eared hare” of line 506. This may be the Earl of Mar, who ordered the army back to Perth the day after the battle (Tayler, 1715, p. 102). But perhaps line 506 refers to two people; in this case we might consider Seaforth and Lord Duffus, who are said to have been the first leaders to reach Perth (Sinclair, Memoirs, p. 232); or perhaps Seaforth and Huntly, since the ballads and Sìleas’ other poems consistently say they ran away.

512-513. Iain Glas, Mac Cailein Mhic Dhunnchaidh (1635–

[TD 153]

1717), first Earl of Breadalbane, who had been the main instigator of the massacre of Glencoe in 1692, was too old to join in the battle himself, though he encouraged his people to do so (see line 478 n.; Tayler, 1715, pp. 24-25). His son John, 6th Baronet of Glenorchy, was a Whig. Maclean suggests (TGSI XLV, p. 104) that Sìleas’ praise of Campbell here may indicate that she did not hold him responsible for Glencoe.

Line 512 is rather long, and the reference to Frangaich in line 513 is hard to explain (cf. TGSI XLV, p. 104). Perhaps the lines could be amended, with benefit to the rhyming system, as:

<gai>Nam biodh Iain ’n a leth-cheud bliadhna ann,
’S na bha fhiannaibh aige fhéin.<eng>

The word ann is not in the source text (T), and is added without authority.

514. seasamh suarach: when Mar’s troops, including the Highlanders, returned from pursuing Argyll’s left wing they took no action against the remains of Argyll’s army, but stood watching them assemble and walk away (Tayler, 1715, p. 100). A move at this point would have turned the battle into a Jacobite victory.

520. Thomas of Ercildoune, Thomas the Rhymer (fl. c. 1200), appears in other Gaelic poems as a prophet, and also as one of those who still lives in Tom na h-Iùbhraich, near Inverness, and will one day come out; for examples see BG, p. 283, and A. M. Mackenzie, Iain Lom, lines 316, 634, 2727. He is often traditionally connected with a great battle to be fought at the Clyde (line 523 here), see J. G. Campbell, Superstitions, p. 271; and An Gaidheal (1st series), Vol. V (1876), p. 95, which quotes the lines:

<gai>An uair thig Tòmas le chuid each,
Bidh là nan creach aig Cluaidh.<eng>

(Cf. A. and A. Macdonald, Poems of Alexander Macdonald, p. 244, st. 1; Celtic Monthly, XXIV, p. 92). In 1715 it does seem to have been intended at first that the Highlanders under General Gordon, after taking Fort William and Inveraray, should then march south and cross the Clyde at Glasgow, instead of joining Mar and crossing the Forth (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 99).

IX. DO DH’ARM RÌGH SHEUMAIS

The only complete version of this poem is in I, where it is entitled “Oran Rioghail”; three stanzas (1, 2, 6) appear also in T, p. 157, copied in SO, p. 60 and MP, p. 445. The only major divergence between the two versions is in st. 2 and here I have followed T, on the grounds that in I the stanza is incomplete in sense without the final refrain line; I ends the stanza:

<gai>… Ged a tha sibh san am
Air feo ghleann agus monanan
D’fhag sibh gun chadal am dhuisge mi.<eng>

(See Sources and Readings.) This dependence on the sense of the refrain does not occur elsewhere in either version, and I have taken it to be an innovation.

This leaves us with a single reference to James, the Chevalier de St. George (line 549, from T only). There is little other internal dating evidence, and without the reference to James we would have no clues at all—the poem might be interpreted as referring to the 1745 rising. On the whole, however, it seems fairly consistent with the period between the Battle of Sheriffmuir (13th November 1715) and the delayed arrival of James (22nd December 1715). During this period Mar’s and Argyll’s armies were largely inactive (Terry, Jacobites & Union, p. 141 n.), and the clans in general were still with Mar; but among those who left shortly after the battle were the MacKenzies under Seaforth and the Gordons under Huntly, who returned to defend their lands against the Whig Frasers, the Earl of Sutherland, Forbes of Culloden and others who were in possession of Inverness (Tayler, 1715, pp. 102, 114).

Both sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas.


553-559. Sìleas exaggerates the difficulties under which the army suffers, presumably in order to blacken King George and encourage the Jacobites to rally under James. Lines 558-559 may refer to the sufferings of the prisoners (including many Scottish and English noblemen and gentlemen) who were taken at Preston, Lancashire, on the same day as the Battle of Sheriffmuir (Tayler, 1715, pp. 86-87); but no executions had yet taken place.

566-569. There is probably deliberate exaggeration here of the cruelty of King George, and the basis for it may be simply

[TD 155]

the deaths of Jacobite soldiers at Sheriffmuir; the number was estimated at 60 by Mar, and 600-800 by the government (Tayler, 1715, p. 103).

571-574. After Sheriffmuir some of the Highlanders expected to be bribed to lay down their arms (as they had been by King William in 1690) but no money appears to have been offered (Tayler, 1715, p. 116). The “sean-mhadadh-allaidh” is presumably King George, and the “nathraichean neimhe” may be the Scottish Hanoverian leaders.

575-576. Argyll estimated in November 1715 that James could quickly assemble 20,000 men on his arrival in Scotland, but when James eventually reached the army at Perth there were barely 5000 (Tayler, 1715, pp. 113, 115).

578-582. This probably means that the inactivity of the Jacobite army after Sheriffmuir was giving Arygll’s forces time to be reinforced; in this Sìleas is perfectly correct (Tayler, 1715, pp. 141-142).

584-589. This well-known fable of Aesop (Stith Thompson, no. J1791.4, “Dog drops his meat for the reflection”) is applied here as a parable probably to those Jacobite leaders who proposed to submit to the Government after Sheriffmuir, suggesting that in submitting they are throwing away the benefits of a victory which is still within their grasp, in a vain hope of getting other benefits from the Government. Such leaders would include Seaforth, who eventually submitted at Inverness (Tayler, 1715, p. 114), and Huntly, who had been seeking surrender terms from Argyll even before the battle (ibid. p. 207).

591. muice: see note on line 202. The use of the words muice and Cuigse in this way is very reminiscent of the English rhyming words, pigs and Whigs.


X. DO GHILLEASBUIG A MAC

The only available source for this poem is I, whence it has been published in AM, p. 78. It is placed here because lines 636-637 show that Gilleasbuig was absent from home when the poem was written, and he was also missing when Poem no. XI was written (see line 669), probably in 1720.

Line 613 is rather obscure in meaning, but if we accepted the interpretation given here in the translation (and see below), then the poem would have to be placed after the present Poem no. XIII, because the line would then mean that Sìleas was

[TD 156]

objecting to the fact that James Gordon had succeeded his father in 1720. But since line 613 is doubtful, I have preferred not to use it as dating evidence.

For some notes on Gilleasbuig see Introduction, Section 4.


613. The word còir appears as cor in I, and the reading còir is suggested by K and AM. Mr Donald Macaulay suggests that the line may be an alternative way of expressing the normal “Is tu as fheàrr còir air a’ chinneach—you have the best claim to the [leadership of the] family”.


XI. CUMHA BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

This poem is based on the text of I, but there are other independent versions, all more or less incomplete, in D, p. 36, H 27/6/1879, p. 6, GS20, p. 17, and MB, p. 93. In I and D stanza 5 is given first, but it is here placed beside the other stanzas which directly address Sìleas’ husband, Alexander.

This poem deals with the death of Alexander and that of Anna, daughter of Sìleas and Alexander; though it is not explicitly stated in this poem or the following two that Anna is in fact their daughter. I have no information about Anna apart from these three poems. Poem no. XIII, as well as lamenting the deaths of Alexander and Anna, laments also the death in the same year of James MacDonald of Sleat. But as the year of James’ death is in question (either 1720 or 1723, see Poem no. XIII, Notes) we must rely on other evidence to date these three poems.

The farm of Camdell was in the hands of Alexander Gordon’s family from 1681 till 1721 (Gaffney, The Lordship of Strathavon, p. 135). Alexander and his father, James Gordon of Tilliesoule (d. 1692), got a wadset on the land in 1681. “After three generations of these Gordons … had held Camdelmore, this wadset was discharged and renounced in 1721 on payment of the wadset sum to James Gordon of Beldornie, son of Alexander” (ibid.). A document among the Gordon Castle Papers, numbered GD44/23/16, records this redemption payment of 7000 merks on 14th April 1721 to James Gordon of Baldornie, “lawful son to umquhile [i.e. deceased] Alexr Gordon late throf” (reference from Mr Victor Gaffney). Alexander was thus obviously dead by April 1721. Since he died in the same year as James MacDonald of Sleat died, and since 1720 and

[TD 157]

1723 are the only years suggested for James’ death, then we are entitled to conclude that Alexander Gordon of Camden and Beldorney, his daughter Anna, and James MacDonald, 13th of Sleat, all died in 1720, and that these three poems were written in that year or the following year (cf. Poem no. XIII, notes).

According to local tradition in Brae Lochaber, Sìleas’ home country, Alexander and Anna died of a fever (H 27/6/1879, p. 6); Dr Ian A. Porter of the Department of Bacteriology, University of Aberdeen, informs me that this fever, since it caused two deaths in the space of about a week, is most likely to have been typhus fever, which was endemic in Scotland at the time; it is not known that there was any epidemic in north-eastern Scotland in 1720.


644. D reads “Chuir mi Anna bheag ’s an ùir”, which might mean that Anna was still very young, though Sìleas was about 60. Anna was buried at the Wallakirk, on the edge of the Beldorney estate, and Alexander was buried (on the Monday after his death, presumably) at Mortlach, near Dufftown (see Poem no. XII, notes).

659-666. The reference is probably to the period of Sìleas’ illness, see Introduction, Section 5.

667-670. On these sons of Alexander see Introduction; on Gilleasbuig see also Poem no. X, notes.

672. This aon mhac must be James, who succeeded his father (Bulloch, Gordons of Wardhouse, p. 14; Wimberley, p. 10); he is not mentioned by name in any of Sìleas’ poems, and it is hard to see why she believed that Alasdair, Iain and Gilleasbuig had prior claim to their father’s estate (see p. lii). He was evidently away from home when his father died, but must have returned fairly quickly in answer to Sìleas’ prayer, for he had taken over his father’s land interests by April 1721 (see above).


XII. LAOIDH AIR BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

This poem is taken from two sources which seem to be independent, but are nevertheless remarkably similar in this case: I, and MC, p. 82. It is to be dated to about 1720 (or possibly 1721), for the deaths of Alexander and Anna probably occurred in 1720 (see Poem no. XI, notes).

[TD 158]

681. an taisgeadh: in addition to the meaning “deposit, placing in storage”, here translated, a metaphorical use of the alternative meaning “smooring a fire, covering a fire for the night” (cf. line 679) is also probably intended here.

684. Mór-chlach: presumably Mortlach, near Dufftown, Banffshire, some eight miles from Beldorney. The form of the name here may be due simply to popular etymology. The church at Muirthillauch was founded by St Moluag (Mo Lua, Lugaid) of Lismore, who died in A.D. 592 (Skene, Celtic Scotland II, p. 135; Grant, History of Mortlach, p. 22); the -t- or -th- occurs in most forms of the name, and Alexander (Place-names of Aberdeenshire, p. 338) suggests a derivation from “Mór-thulach”. Mortlach was a bishopric until the see was transferred to Aberdeen by King David I in the 12th century (Grant, op. cit. p. 25). I have no corroboration that Alexander Gordon was buried there, nor do I know why he should have been. Mortlach may have had particular connections with the Beldorney family, for it is said that “in 1550 John Gordon, son of the laird of Baldorne, was called to the living of Mortlach by the parishioners” (Grant, p. 27; cf. Cramond, The Daily Free Press, Aberdeen, 8/11/1899, p. 7).

Poem no. XI makes it clear that Alexander died on a Saturday (st. 3), and he was probably buried on the following Monday (line 657).

689. a’ bhalla: the sources read “a bhall” (I) and “a bhad” (MC). A description of the parish of Glass, written in 1724, mentions Beldorney itself and then goes on: “About a quarter of a myle down the river, clos by the water side, there is ane ruinous kirk, called Wallach Kirk: some part of the walls do remain, with the font. There is a large church yeard about it” (Spalding Club, Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff, Vol. II, p. 181; Macfarlane, Geographical Collections I, p. 80; cf. Mackinlay, Influence of pre-Reformation Church, p. 152). This was originally the church of the old parish of Dunmeth (Dumeth, Dalmeath), which was united with the parish of Glass in 1618 (Scott, Fasti VI, p. 311), and it is said to have been founded by St Walloch. Simpson believed (Celtic Church in Scotland, p. 67) that St Walloch was an emissary of St Ninian’s monastery at Candida Casa in Wigtownshire, and that he died in 733, but Scott (loc. cit.) identifies him with St Faolchu, the 12th abbot of Iona, who died in 724.

The Wallakirk graveyard is still in use, and contains a small

[TD 159]

walled enclosure, possibly part of the original church and very probably the wall here referred to by Sìleas. A plaque on the interior wall of this enclosure marks it as the burial-ground of “The Gordons of Wardhouse”; this plaque was erected in 1913 by Rafael Gordon of Wardhouse, lineal descendant of Sìleas (see Introduction, Section 4). The central gravestone in the enclosure, the only Gordon one there, is fairly clearly inscribed and my reading of it as follows:

The body of KATHRINE
GORDON second Daugh
ter to JAMES GORDON
late of Beldorny who
died in Banff the third
of March 1793 in the 61
Year of her Age

The dates of this granddaughter of Sìleas as given by Wimberley (p. 11) will therefore have to be revised. The inscription on another stone in this enclosure has been interpreted by Henderson, Aberdeenshire Epitaphs, p. 337.

There can hardly be much doubt that Sìleas’ daughter Anna is buried, without a stone, in the same walled enclosure, which is quite clearly visible through the trees (in winter) from several of the rooms in Beldorney Castle.

710-714. It is not true that all of Sìleas’ family were dead, as line 710 might imply; we know that James, Alasdair and Katerine at least survived (Introduction, Section 4). Perhaps Sìleas means that all those who had been living with her were dead, namely her husband and Anna. She clearly saw parallels between her own case and that of Job, both in the loss of her relatives and in the fact that she suffered physically for her own good (lines 731-734); this last is surely a reference to her well-known illness (see Introduction, Section 5).

715-730. Matt. xxv. 31-34, 41.


XIII. MARBHRANN

This poem laments three deaths which occurred in the same year—those of Sìleas’ husband and her daughter Anna (lamented also in nos. XI and XII), and that of Sir James MacDonald, 13th of Sleat. I have edited it here from four independent sources: MD (4 stanzas only), ML MS 146 (lacking 2 stanzas),

[TD 160]

I (complete text) and GS20, p. 18 (5 stanzas). In addition, I have made use of G, p. 141, which is at least partly derived from ML, and SO, p. 58, which is based on G.

The subjects of the poem have been wrongly identified in the past, and this has led to inaccurate historical statements. Gillies (1786) was the first to cause confusion by saying (in his title, see Sources and Readings) that the poem is “… air Bas a fir”; this statement is not made in ML. I quite correctly says that the poem is “air Bais a Fir & a h Ighinn &c.” But Gillies’ title is accepted in SO (1841), and Mackenzie’s emendations to the text, as well as his title, show that he considered the entire poem to deal with Alexander Gordon, Sìleas’ husband. In the poem as given here, stt. 2-3 deal with Alexander, stt. 4-5 with Anna, and all the rest with James MacDonald (the poet having already written two poems on the deaths of Alexander and Anna). Mackenzie emends his text of line 756 by using the word fearail, obviously interpreting cuilean grádhach (line 755) as referring to Alexander; but st. 5 (given here from MD and I, both hitherto unpublished) shows that the reference is to Anna, as Maclean Sinclair suggested in GS20, p. 19. It was almost certainly a similar misinterpretation of lines 781-782 which led K. N. Macdonald (MB, p. 92) to say of Sìleas: “Her husband is said to have fought at Killiecrankie and Sheriffmuir”. I have found no evidence that he did so. Likewise, as is pointed out in the American edition of SO, John Mackenzie’s statement (SO, 1872, p. 58; cf. Clan Donald III, p. 576) that Sìleas’ husband “died of a fit of intoxication, while on a visit to Inverness” is probably based unwarrantably on st. 7 here.

In 1863 Norman MacDonald, editor of the pirated American edition of SO, noticed the many difficulties that arise if the poem is treated merely as a lament for Alexander; and he decided that Sìleas was not the author of the poem (SO, 1863, p. 43). Macpherson (H 27/6/1879, p. 6) shared MacDonald’s doubts about the poem, and added: “I need not add that the ‘marbhrann’ is evidently a patchwork”. But both ML and I ascribe the poem to Sìleas, and there is no other ascription. Maclean Sinclair in 1894 (GS20, p. 19) was the first to state that the bulk of the poem concerns James MacDonald of Sleat, and this suggestion irons out most of the difficulties of interpretation.

James MacDonald of Oronsay, later of Sleat, had fought at

[TD 161]

Killiecrankie, had shared with his brother William the leadership of his family at Sheriffmuir (see line 238 n.), and in 1719 took the Government side (Clan Donald III, pp. 83-84). Sìleas tells us in lines 807-808;

<gai>Chaill sinn ionann agus còmhla
Sir Dòmhnall ’s a mhac ’s a bhràthair.<eng>

This refers to Sir Donald MacDonald, 11th of Sleat, who died in 1718, his son, Sir Donald, 12th, who died in 1719 (TGSI XLV, p. 282), and James. The date of James’ death is given either as 1720 (Clan Donald III, p. 84; Nicolson, History of Skye, p. 216) or more often as 1723 (Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 231; Cameron, History of Skye, p. 84; GS20, p. 19). If the date 1723 is based merely on the fact that James’ son was served heir to him in that year (Clan Donald III, p. 474), then it is not a reliable date; the lines quoted above obviously make 1720 the preferable date. And we know that Alexander Gordon was dead by 1721 (see Poem no. XI, Notes). The poem is therefore good evidence that James MacDonald died in 1720, not in 1723. Mackenzie (History, p. 231) and Maclean Sinclair (GS20, p. 19) tell us that James died at Forres, and this is hardly incompatible with the visit to Inverness mentioned in line 768. Maclean Sinclair also tells us that he died there “from the effects of a spree on wine”, but this may be merely on the evidence of stanzas 6-7 here.

In spite of the order of stt. 2-5, Poem no. XI shows that Anna died over a week before Alexander, and it is reasonable to infer that James died later than they did, for he is said (Clan Donald III, p. 475) to have died in December 1720. This poem is therefore probably later than nos. XI and XII, for Sìleas would not be likely to devote most of the poem to James if her own husband and daughter had died more recently than he. The last part of the chorus might possibly imply that the poem was written on the last day of the year, which is quite possible if James died in December. Note in particular the oldest version extant, that of MD (1770):

<gai>An diugh an Là ’s mi ga chuntadh
So ceann na bliadhna thog riadh dhiom dùbailt.<eng>

739. Compare the line:—

<gai>Cha choma leam fhéin no co dhiu sin<eng>

[TD 162]

which begins a poem written between 1692 and 1704 by Mairiread Nighean Lachlainn (TGSI XLII, p. 32, and cf. p. 35). Cf. SGS X, p. 41.

752. There may be a reference here to the poet’s illness (cf. Introduction, Section 5).

764. The head of the MacDonalds of Sleat was generally regarded as the leader of all Clan Donald (Clan Donald III, p. 168).

767. Cead nan creachan: I am interpreting cead, at a suggestion from Professor D. S. Thomson, as having an extension of the meaning “permission, leave”, and implying something like “holiday, trip”. Most of the sources have ceud, and we might read Ceud nan Creachan; this expression, as in S, p. 96, last line, seems to be a strengthened form of Mo chreach.

771-774. The Sleat estate was forfeited to the crown and Sir Donald attainted after the 1715 Rising (Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 229; Tayler, 1715, p. 322), and the estate had to be bought back into the family in 1726 (Clan Donald III, p. 85). The “enemies” in line 774 may be the Commissioners of Forfeited Estates and their factor, MacLeod of Hamara, with whom successive chiefs struggled to regain the estate (Nicolson, History of Skye, pp. 214-217). The “friends” in line 771 are probably the MacDonalds of Keppoch and Glengarry, whose lands were mainly inland.

779-780. The various source texts diverge widely in these lines, and in most of them line 780 has some of the words of line 776. Tionnsgalach first appears in G, while ML, the oldest source for the stanza, has Ceannsgalach here as in line 776.

783. The “ship of the fierce lions” addressed in this stanza is probably the house of Sleat, whose coat of arms, like that of Clanranald, contains both a ship and a lion (Sir Bernard Burke, The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, London, 1884, pp. 637-638). These features of the coats of arms are mentioned in several other Gaelic poems, cf. the MacCormick Collection, p. 166, n. 216; TGSI XXXIII, p. 39.

784. geàrr-gheal: this might rather imply “clenched” fists.

788. On James’ death his only surviving brother was William, mentioned also in line 239. James’ successor was his son Alexander who was only 10 years old when his father died. In his will, James appointed William to be Alexander’s tutor, and William served in this function till his death in 1730 (Clan Donald III, pp. 540-541).

792. I have altered this line substantially to make some sense

[TD 163]

of it. ML, the oldest source, has “Mar chraoibh iular, mheular, mheaghar”, which is changed in SO to “Mar chraoibh ubhlan, mheulair mhìaghair”. In I the original line “Na mis(?) ur nach lub snach meallaich” is stroked out and replaced by that of ML. The form suggested here is no more than a shot in the dark, and the rhyming system shows that it is nothing like the original form.


XIV. ALASDAIR A GLEANNA GARADH

This poem is here edited from six sources: N, ML MS 120, MD, E, MN MS 6, and GS20, p. 19. N was written hardly more than thirty years after the composition of the poem.

The poem is presumably to be dated to the year of the death of Alasdair Dubh, 11th MacDonald of Glengarry, the hero of Sheriffmuir (see line 494 n.), but the date of his death is in dispute. The date of his birth is unknown, and he first appears representing his father as leader of his family at Killiecrankie in 1689. The confusion about various dates in his life is made clear in The Clan Donald: in Vol. II his father, Ranald, is said to have died in 1694 (p. 454), while in Vol. III Ranald’s death is said to have occurred in 1705 (p. 312). After distinguishing himself at Sheriffmuir, Alasdair submitted to the government in 1716, and took no part in the rising of 1719 (Clan Donald II, pp. 457-458). His death is said to have occurred in 1721 (Clan Donald III, p. 312; BG, p. 128) or in 1724 (Clan Donald II, p. 460; Mackenzie, History of the Macdonalds, p. 349; GS20, p. 19). The year 1720 is also mentioned (History and Atchievements of the Robertsons, c. 1775, p. 10).

I have found no positive evidence to make either 1721 or 1724 preferable. It is noticeable that the first important document connected with Alasdair’s successor, his son John, is a charter dated 1724 (Clan Donald II, p. 461; Mackenzie, History, p. 349), and this alone may have suggested that year as the date of Alasdair’s death; since this is not real evidence, the year 1721 may be preferable. But William Mackay believes (without saying why) that a reference in a letter headed “Inverness, 26 8ber 1722” from Bailie John Steuart (Mackay, Letter-book, pp. xliv, 192), where he says “Glengarie wrott me tuo days agoe”, is to Alasdair Dubh; if this were so, then 1724 would have to be the year of Alasdair’s death. Till more

[TD 164]

conclusive evidence is found, therefore, we can only say that this poem was probably written either in 1721 or in 1724. Alasdair was buried at Cill-fhìonain in Glengarry (MC, pp. xix, 86).

Mrs Anne Grant (1755–1838) of Laggan, Inverness-shire, in her “Memoir of the Family of Lochiel” (Letters, Scot. Hist. Soc. Vol. XXVI, p. 316) written in 1808, speaking of Sìleas, has this to say:

Of her monody on the death of the renown’d Alaster Du, or at least of one of the many poems she consecrated to his memory, follows an extract literally translated, and selected more for its singularity than any superiority of poetical merit:

Dark Alexander of Glengarrie,
Thou art departed and we remain forlorn.
Thou wert our guard, our comfort, and our ornament,
Thou wert admir’d of lovely women,
Thou wert the pleasure of heroic men,
Thou wert as among metals as the most pure gold,
Thou wert as the noblest Lyon among the beasts,
Among the birds as is the Eagle of strongest wing,
As is the shapely Salmon of bright scales among the fish,
As is the moon among Stars,
Or the fair-hair’d sun amidst revolving planets, etc. etc.

The parallel betwixt Alastar Du and every object of transcendent worth is carried much further, and concluded with some very tender and pathetic retrospections of the past and sublime anticipation of the future.


If the poem is, as seems unlikely, literally translated, Mrs Grant must have known a version considerably different from any of those used here.

I have noted three other laments for Alasdair’s death: E, p. 99, SO, p. 76, by An t-Aosdana Mac Mhathain; T, p. 91, SO, p. 49, wrongly ascribed to Iain Lom, see A. M. Mackenzie, Iain Lom, p. xxiv; and MC, p. 86. There is also a poem to Alasdair and his brothers, alive, in T, p. 163, and Alexander Robertson of Struan wrote a short “epitaph” for him in English (History and Atchievements, p. 10).


807-808. Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat, Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh (mentioned in line 238) died in 1718 (Clan Donald

III, p. 474) and was succeeded by his son Sir Donald, 12th of Sleat, who died in September 1719 (TGSI XLV, p. 282). The second Donald was succeeded by his uncle, Sir James, formerly James of Oronsay, who died in December 1720, see Poem no. XIII, Notes.

810. See note on lines 356-363.

811-813. These lines probably refer to Ailein Mùideartach rather than to Alasdair Dubh; “seobhag sùil-ghorm” (line 814) is applied to Ailein also in line 358, though it is applied to Alasdair in T, p. 165.

823-830. I have given a reading for this stanza which is quite different from that in BG, p. 129, though equally obscure if not more so. The name Dòmhnall in line 823 is found only in N, the oldest source. Being disyllabic, it fits the general pattern of the poem better than does the Goll of BG and the other source texts, though it gives a poorer rhyme (visually) with long in line 824. No apt reference to an exploit of Goll Mac Mòirne has, to my knowledge, been cited to explain the version in BG (in spite of an additional interpretation of the passage, given in TGSI XLV, p. 109), so the possibility remains that Dòmhnall is original here, although N is not always a reliable text. The reference might be to some earlier adventure of Alasdair and Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh, who would have been of roughly the same age; or it may still be to the Rising of 1715 or that of 1719, as suggested in BG p. 296.

847-853. On the traditional status of the various trees see BG, pp. 296-297, where leamhan in line 853 is said to represent the lime-tree. Cf. Watson, Scottish Verse, p. 268.

855. Alasdair was married twice (Clan Donald III, p. 312), and his second wife, Mary, is referred to here. She was the daughter of Coinneach Mór, 3rd Earl of Seaforth, and died in 1726.

867. Alasdair was succeeded by his eldest son John, who led the family till his death in 1754 (Clan Donald III, p. 313).


XV. AN AGHAIDH NA H-OBAIR NODHA

This poem is edited from I, and S, p. 366. Stt. 9, 13 and 14 occur only in I, stt. 7 and 10-12 only in S; only four lines of st. 9 occur. Both sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas, though this ascription is presumably one of those

[TD 166]

objected to (MB, p. 92; cf. Poem no. II, Notes) on the grounds of impropriety of content. St. 2 has been recorded recently in Tiree (see Sources and Readings). Line 967 clearly dates the poem to the period after 1720, when Sìleas’ husband died (Poem no. XI, Notes).

John Mackenzie (SO, p. 58) says that this poem was composed in answer to “a song by Mr M’Kenzie of Gruineard called ‘An obair nogha’”. The words of this song are given in Mackenzie’s Leobhar Liath, though no author is named there; it is in the same metre as Sìleas’ poem, but also has a luinneag. It is given here as Appendix III, and compared with it Sìleas’ reply could scarcely be called excessively indelicate. There is little in the present poem to make it incompatible with the religious poems she was presumably composing during the same period. The general tone of the poem is similar to that of Poem no. II, whose position in this collection is, of course, arbitrary.

In the Angus Fraser MS the tune title An obair nodha is translated as The Work in prospect (see Metres & Tunes), but it seems clear from Appendix III that, as Maclean suggests (TGSI XLV, p. 111), the Obair Nodha praised by MacKenzie of Gruineard was simply sexual licence. Mr David Murison of Aberdeen University suggests that the word Obair may be used here with the basic meaning of “a religious revival”, a meaning which its Lowland Scots counterpart wark can have. I have not seen this extension of meaning for obair in dictionaries, but it is quite possible that it had such a meaning, if only by direct translation by MacKenzie of Gruineard from Lowland Scots for the purposes of his poem. It is possible that this meaning of obair (revival) is then profaned to cover some sort of “revival” of sexual licence.

Mac Phàrlain says (MP, p. 448), presumably of this poem and no. II: “Tha dà dhàn eile le Sìleas an clò, nach faodar a chur sìos an so. Tha iad a’ coireachadh dubhailc a thàinig à Sasunn ’san linn ud nach robh comharraichte a thaobh deagh bheusan.” He may refer to the rise of bawdy verse in England on the restoration of King Charles II in 1660; the poetry (in English) of Alexander Robertson of Struan (c. 1670–1749) was greatly influenced by this verse. MacKenzie of Gruineard may have been reacting against religious revivals and the moral atmosphere of society in much the same way as the Restoration verse was partly a reaction against the Puritanism of the 1650s.

[TD 167]

The author of the original Obair Nodha is presumably the poet identified by Maclean Sinclair (Mactalla nan Tur, p. 46) as George MacKenzie, 2nd of Gruineard, Wester Ross. He was a grandson of George, 2nd Earl of Seaforth, and was perhaps born about 1655. He married Margaret MacKenzie, granddaughter of Sir Roderick MacKenzie of Cóigeach (An Taoitear Tàileach), in 1696, and is said to have had thirty-three children from two marriages (Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies, pp. 459-461). Another poem by him appears in ML MS 169, G, p. 55, see Poem no. XI, Metres and Tunes.


872. tòghnadh: in S, and in T, p. 311, where the first two lines are quoted, the word given here is sòlas, but tòghnadh (tomhnadh in I) gives a better rhyme with bhodhradh. The word occurs again in the very similar opening of a poem by Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair in ML MS 89 (cf. T, p. 28):

<gai>Gur mise thair mo bhoth’radh
Le tonadh na hEalain ud …<eng>

The word is said by A. and A. Macdonald (Poems of Alexander Macdonald, p. 408) to be borrowed from English and to mean “toning, sound, noise”.

922, 934. The expression “éirich (àrdaich) air a’ chriosan” denotes pregnancy. Other examples of this use are to be found in TGSI XXII, p. 189, st. 11 (from ML), S, p. 341, Carm. Gad. V, p. 112, the MacCormick Collection, lines 478-482. Criosan here must be in some way distinct from crios (belt), which appears in line 948; perhaps waist (Dwelly) is a more suitable meaning than girdle.

924. boga-bhriseadh: this appears as bog a bhriseidh in S, the only source. It is tentatively understood here as a compound of bog (soft) and briseadh (a breach, a defeat). But we might also compare the seana-bhog of line 973, the Boga-Nogha of MacKenzie of Gruineard’s poem, which seems to be an equivalent of Obair Nodha, and the word bogan “penis”.

955. It has been suggested (TGSI XLV, p. 111) that Ruairidh here is the name of the MacKenzie of Gruineard who composed the original Obair Nodha. If so, this might be Roderick, 6th son of George MacKenzie, 2nd of Gruineard (Mackenzie, History of the Mackenzies, p. 460). But it should be remembered that this suggestion is made on the basis of the version in S only, and that this version does not contain stanzas

[TD 168]

13 and 14 with their additional unidentified names, Sìne and Seumas.

978. The reference to Glencoe seems strange, but might be explained if, as suggested in the Introduction, Section 1, Sìleas had a sister married to Alasdair, Mac Iain, 12th chief of Glencoe. However, Mac Iain’s wife is said to have died on the night after the Massacre in 1692 (Prebble, Glencoe, p. 247).


XVI. LAOIDH NA MAIDNE

My only source for this poem is ML MS 165 (1775), where it is headed “Le Sili Ni Mhic Ranuill air faighin a Cainte an deis a bhi tri bliadhna gun bhiagh, gun deoch, gun chaint”. This tradition of the poet’s illness accords well with that given in D, Appendix p. 2 (see Introduction, Section 5), but as K. D. MacDonald suggests (AM, p. 84), the tradition is probably irrelevant to the present poem, which is better treated as a simple morning hymn. The connection with the illness (or “trance”) may have been suggested by the word dùsgadh in line 980.

As with most of the religious poems here, I have no evidence to date this poem, and its position here is arbitrary.


992. The motif of the seven-headed monster (Stith Thompson, no. B11.2.3.1) has been noted in Egypt in the 3rd millenium B.C. (Bloomfield, Seven Deadly Sins, p. 336, n. 326). It has been suggested that the seven-headed monsters in the Apocalypse (Revelation xii. 3) and in Dante’s Purgatorio represent the seven capital sins, as in the present poem (Bloomfield, pp. 85, 159).

995-996. The seven capital sins, mentioned also in lines 1233-1234. The word drùis is supplied from line 1233, as being more fitting here than the tnu of the manuscript.

1003 f. The succeeding passage, where arrows are used to destroy the seven-headed monster, is reminiscent of the poem Tha seachd saighdean air mo thì, where the arrows are the seven capital sins; this poem is attributed in the Book of the Dean of Lismore (see Rel. Celt. I, p. 104) to one Dunnchadh Òg, and appears also in the Fernaig MS (Mac Phàrlain ed., p. 22).

1005. Compare line 1014. The line is probably out of place here, as the absence of aicill would indicate, and is being used to replace a lost line.

[TD 169]

XVII. LAOIDH AN T-SOLUIS

This poem derives from three copies made by Fr Allan MacDonald of Eriskay round about 1890 from the lost manuscript of Iain Bàn Innse, which is the only source known to me. Fr Allan published it as Laoidh na Maidne in LS, p. 17.

The poem is ascribed to Sileas in one of his copies, CW, p. 222, cf. Campbell, The Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 103, 105: this is the only ascription, and it is unsubstantiated. But in the same place Fr Allan also ascribes to Sileas the poems which appear here as nos. III, XVIII, XIX, XX and XXIII, in no case providing any substantiation; in the case of four of these the ascription is verified from other sources, and in the case of Poem no. XVIII the ascription is partly confirmed by the content of the poem. There is thus little reason to doubt Fr Allan’s statement that Sileas was the author of the present poem.


XVIII. LAOIDH NA H-OIDHCHE

This poem is taken from CW, where it was copied by Fr Allan MacDonald from the lost Iain Bàn MS. Unfortunately, Fr Allan left the transcription unfinished in the middle of st. 8 (with the word “&c.”), and we have no source to supply the remainder and no indication of how much is missing. The first four stanzas make no personal reference to the poet, and these appear, also from Iain Bàn’s MS, in A and in LS, p. 18.

I have reversed the order of stt. 6 and 7 in the manuscript to give what appears to me to be better sense. The incident recounted with such little detail in stt. 5-7 may perhaps have occurred when Sìleas awoke in the night, found that she could not awaken her husband and feared that he was dying; then prayed that he should have the opportunity of saying his prayers before death. On the whole, it seems quite likely that only the two final lines of st. 8 are missing from the poem, which seems reasonably complete in sense. The (presumably young) children of line 1074 might possibly be some of Sìleas’ grandchildren. Though the incident would have occurred before 1720 (the year of her husband’s death, see Poem no. XI, Notes), we have no evidence for the date of this poem.

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in CW, p. 222.

[TD 170]

1072. coinneal: the MS is a little unclear here, and the word written looks like coigneal or coicgneal. I have substituted coinneal at the suggestion of Kenneth MacDonald.


XIX. LAOIDH MHOIRE MHAIGHDEAN

This is probably the most popular of Sìleas’ poems, and I have used seven independent sources for it: ML MS 47; I; LC, p. 109 (which has many interpolations); IA (= GS7, p. 115), from a Badenoch source; H 25/7/1879, p. 6 (= GS12, p. 162); CW MS 61, from an Eigg source; MB, p. 92, from a Fort Augustus source. Five of these seven ascribe the poem to Sìleas, and I have seen no other ascription.

The title Laoidh Mhoire Mhaighdean does not fit the theme of the poem very well, but it is used here because it is the title used by the singers of the modern oral versions.

I have no dating evidence for the poem. It is stated in H 27/6/1879, p. 6, and in MB, p. 92, that Sìleas composed the poem after she came out of her “trance”, but no substantiation of this statement is given; it is probably based simply on the tradition that all Sìleas’ religious poetry was composed as a result of a “conversion” occasioned by her illness or “trance” (Introduction, Section 5).

The poem is still known in oral tradition, and other versions are available in addition to the seven used here. They are not cited in the Sources and Readings because they do not, in my opinion, happen to contain any readings preferable to those in the seven older sources. Round about 1889, Fr Allan MacDonald noted the following South Uist version of st. 16:

<gai>Mhathair na biodh ortsa mulad
Ged a dh-fhuirich mise a’s teampull
Seirbheis m’athair anns na flathabh
’S fheudar dhomh fhreagairt ’san àm sa.<eng>

(CW MS 58A, p. 177, Item 367. Fr Allan adds: “Probably from the Original ‘Di-do bheatha Mhoire’”; “Got this from D M‘Intyre, Shoemaker Kilp.”; “Bruce Hector McIntyre in Howmore he thinks knows it”). J. L. Campbell has also recorded a South Uist version (see Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 108, n. 5). There are two recent recordings of the poem in the School of Scottish Studies, Edinburgh: SA1951/8, sung by Fanny MacIsaac of Benbecula, which provides the tune used

[TD 171]

here (cf. Innes Review, loc. cit.; on the origin of the words of this version see note on line 1104 below); this contains stt. 3, 5, 1, 2, 4, 7, 6, plus twenty further lines: and SA1962/4, sung by Mary Gillies of Barra; this contains stt. 1-3, 5, 8, 11-20, lines 1163-4, 1176, 1173-4, stt. 25, 23, 27.


1092. Cf. A. M. Mackenzie, Iain Lom, line 1798; and MC, p. 46, last stanza.

1093-1100. ML, the oldest source, lacks stanza 4. With the exception of MB, all other sources place it after stanza 5 (this includes SA1962/4). But the chronology of the Biblical narrative seems to demand the order given here. Perhaps the similarity of the opening lines of stt. 3 and 5 suggested that these stanzas should be placed together.

1101-1108. All sources, including SA1951/8, place st. 7 before st. 6; this is altered here to accord with the Bible story.

1104. After this line in LC the following passage occurs:

<gai>Sgeul ro aoibhneach gun mhearrachd,
Deir an t-Aingeal tha mi’g innseadh
An diugh rugadh dhuibh an cathair Dhaibhidh
Neach ’s e, Slanuigh’ear Iosa Criosd.

Na gabhaibh eagal no curam
Dol gu dluth do Bhethlehem,
Gheibh sibh Iosa ann am phrasaich
Air a phasgadh am brat-speillidh:
Sgeul ro thaitneach lan do sholas
Do gach seorsa an Chinne daoine,
Gun d’rugadh dhuibh an diugh gu cinnteach
Prionnsa na sith ni sibhse shaoradh.

Air ball bha maille ris an Aingeal
’Nuair a labhair e na briathran,
Armailte neamh mar chomhla
A seinn Nuadh-laoidh cha chualas riabh i
Deir iad “Gloir do Dhia ’s na h-ardaibh
“Sith air talamh deagh-ghean do dhaoine,”
Ni nach faoidte riabh a’radhuinn
Gus ’n d’rugadh Slanuigh’ear an t-saoghail.<eng>

This is likely to be one of M’Coinnich’s many interpolations (see Sources and Readings; the interpolations are hardly

[TD 172]

numerous enough to justify his claim in the title: “a mhor chuid Dh’i leis an Ughdair”). The passage does not appear in any of the other older texts of the poem, but it reappears, almost word for word, in the version sung by Fanny MacIsaac of Benbecula, SA1951/8. The best explanation seems to be that the Benbecula text derives from LC (in spite of the fact that LC is an Episcopalian catechism and that Fanny MacIsaac was a Catholic), because all the verses sung in the Benbecula text, both original text and interpolation, are extremely close to those of LC. For example, in LC line 1097 reads:

Cha d’iarr i Macaibh ùr na uasal.

In SA1951/8 the line is:

Cha do dh’iarr am Macan ùr na uasal,

although both these forms of the line, taken literally, seem rather confused in sense.

A further indication that part, at least, of the above passage is not original (i.e. not composed by Sìleas na Ceapaich) is to be found in the lines there given for Luke ii. 14:

Gloir do Dhia ’s na h-ardaibh
Sith air talamh deagh-ghean do dhaoine.

We cannot be sure where Sìleas got her knowledge of the Scriptures, but lines 713-714 indicate that she possessed a copy of the Bible. The only Bible which was available to her and acceptable to the Catholic Church to which she belonged was probably the Douai English translation, based on the Latin Vulgate of St Jerome; in place of the above lines, any Gaelic translation from Douai available to Sìleas, or made by herself, would have read more like: “Glòir do Dhia anns na h-àrdaibh, agus air talamh sìth do luchd na deagh thoile” (Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis; Iùl a’ Chrìosdaidh, p. 59). The only Gaelic Bible Sìleas could have seen was that produced by Robert Kirk in 1690 (or the Irish translation by Bishop Bedell, published in 1685, on which Kirk was based, or the 1602 Irish New Testament which Bedell incorporated), and K. D. MacDonald points out to me that Kirk in this passage uses the word deagh-thoil, and that the form deagh-ghean first appeared in the translation of 1767, long after Sìleas’ death, but in good time to be used for an interpolation in LC (1821).

[TD 173]

1157. ML, I and CW reintroduce the third person and the past tense at this point: “Chuir iad e o Phìleat gu Hérod” etc., but this gives the events in the wrong chronological order. MB corrects this by placing st. 20 after st. 23, in the third person.

1161-1162. These lines are almost certainly wrong, the word dhachaidh raising particular difficulties of sense, but I can find no better reading in the sources. The lines might be explained if there were some lost stanzas preceding them, but we have no evidence that there were any.

1173-1176. Lines 1175-1176 precede lines 1173-1174 in the oldest sources (ML, I, LC) and in CW, but in the interests of historical chronology H is followed in this case to give the present order.


XX. AN EAGLAIS

This poem derives from two sources which seem to be independent: CW, where it is copied from the lost Iain Bàn MS, and H 27/6/1879, where the source is not named. Macpherson also had access to a MS by Iain Bàn (see Abbreviations and Sources), but the two versions used here are so different that they are unlikely to derive from the same manuscript source. CW has been printed in LS, p. 23, H in GS12, p. 165. Both sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas, as does Mr Calum Johnston, the Barra seanchaidh (TGSI XLV, p. 112).

This is the only one of the religious poems containing any dating evidence, but unfortunately the evidence is ambiguous. The first two lines of the poem seem to me to contain a clear echo of lines 1125-1126 (Poem no. XIX; the form triar, as in the first line here, appears in one of the source texts of line 1125), and this would indicate that the present poem was written later than no. XIX, the triar in the first line being the Holy Family during their exile in Egypt.

But taking the first five lines of the poem together, it could be argued that the triar consisted of King James VII, his wife, Mary of Modena, and their son, James Francis Edward; lines 1193-1194 clearly suggest a reference to current affairs rather than to the Bible. James VII joined his wife and son in France in January 1689 (Petrie, Jacobite Movement, pp. 54-65) and died in September 1701 (Tayler, Old Chevalier, p. 24); this interpretation would therefore mean that the poem was written

[TD 174]

between these two dates, and would make it the oldest extant datable poem by Sìleas. Or if the Royal Family are being deliberately compared with the Holy Family by means of the echo of line 1125 mentioned above, then Poem no. XIX would be even older than the present poem.

This identification of the triar is, however, highly speculative and I have not thought it certain enough to justify placing the poem first in the collection. The fear expressed in line 1193 (which might be read as a contemporary parallel of the Biblical exile) that Sìleas and other Catholics might be banished could apply at many points during the poet’s life other than the period of the exile of James VII (cf. Anson, Catholic Church, pp. 54-55, 82-88).

In CW the name Farquharson is written at the end of the poem; it can hardly be an ascription of authorship, for on p. 222 CW ascribes the poem to Sìleas. The reference is probably to Fr John Farquharson (fl. c. 1745), who composed the poem Mhic Shimidh, mosgail o d’ shuain to Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat (the poem is printed by Henderson in Leabhar nan Gleann, p. 140, and by Colin Chisholm in Celtic Magazine VII, p. 49). Fr Allan MacDonald copied a version of this poem from the lost Iain Bàn MS into his Notebook VI (now among the Henderson MSS) as Item 291; in the introductory remarks on the poem there he mentions that the preceding poem in the Iain Bàn MS is about the Church, i.e. probably the present poem. It is thus possible that in Fr Allan’s transcription the name Farquharson has accidentally become attached to the wrong poem (Information from Dr. J. L. Campbell).


1201-1224. The allegorical figure of a Castle, here representing the Church, was extremely common in medieval English preaching, see Owst, Literature and Pulpit, pp. 77-85. The Castle of Unity in the 14th century Piers Plowman (Books XIX-XX) is a similar figure of the Church. The Blessed Virgin (line 1209) and the Sacraments (lines 1223-1227) frequently appear as allegorical parts of the Castle (Owst, pp. 77-78).

1215-1220. Matt. xvi. 19.

1233-1234. The Seven Capital, or Deadly Sins, listed also in lines 995-996, can be traced in literature as far back as 100 B.C. (Bloomfield, Seven Deadly Sins, pp. 44 ff.), and are frequently alluded to in medieval poetry. The earliest Gaelic

[TD 175]

(Irish) references to them are listed by Bloomfield, op. cit. p. 357, n. 28.

1237-1244. The four additional virtues mentioned by Sìleas (line 1238) are given first (lines 1239-1240), and then followed by the seven virtues contrary to the Capital Sins. The English form given in the translation for these seven virtues is that usually applied to them in English, rather than a direct translation of the Gaelic terms in the text.

XXI. CUMHA LACHLAINN DAILL

This poem is edited from the versions in I and S, p. 357, in both of which it is attributed to Sìleas. The following stanza is added at the end of the poem in S:

<gai>Tha’n tàl so th’aguinn an tras,
Air caoch’ladh gu mor o chleachd an sinsir,
Threig iad am fiughantas, ’san cairdeas,
An ceol, an treuntas, ’san seanachas,
’S e duine a’s cliutach san àm so,
Am fear a’s pailt de chuir, ’s de lùban,
’S e sin comhairlich nan daoine mora,
’S an duine chòir cha bhi ach umaidh.<eng>

Watson obviously believed that this stanza did not belong properly to the present poem, for he left the stanza out when copying the poem from S into BG, p. 131. Since the last line of the poem, as given here and in I and BG, is a repetition of the first—this means of closing a poem being old (cf. Poem no. XIV)—we are justified in excluding the above verse from the poem; further, the stanza adds nothing to the theme of the poem, and is metrically much less well constructed.

The identity of the subject of the poem is in some doubt. In S he is named as “Lachlan Mac Ionmhuinn, an Clarsair”, and in I as “Lachlain dall Clairsfhear”, cf. the titles, Sources and Readings. The Stewarts’ title has led to the assumption that, he is the poet Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig (Mac Fhionghuin), who is said to have lived from 1665 till 1734: some of his poems are to be found in SO, pp. 81 ff., S, p. 411. The resultant tradition of a love affair (probably based on line 1315 here) between Sìleas and Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig has

[TD 176]

led to the attribution to Sìleas of the poem given here as Appendix II. The identification of Lachlann Dall as Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig has also led to the belief that Sìleas was still alive in 1734 (cf. Introduction and MB, p. 92).

But the Rev. William Matheson has suggested to me various reasons for doubting this identification. We might accept on the authority of S (though the Stewarts were probably no less prone to error than later writers) that Lachlann’s surname was Mac Fhionghuin; the fact that Sìleas and he in their conversations dealt first of all with Sleat (line 1274) might tend to confirm this to some little extent, Clann Fhionghuin being neighbours of Clann Dòmhnaill Shléibhte in Skye. But while the subject of this poem is called “Lachlan Mac Ionmhuinn” by the Stewarts (p. 357), they call the well-known poet “Lachlan Mac Thearlaich, duin’ uasal de Chloinn Ionmhuinn” (p. 411); this might indicate that two different people are intended.

I have seen two separate accounts of the life of Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig, apart from the notes in SO, p. 80: one is that published by the Rev. Alex. Macgregor in An Gaidheal in 1874, and again in English in The Celtic Magazine in 1876; this forms the basis of Maclean Sinclair’s account in GB, p. 160, and of that in Mackinnon, Clan Fingon, p. 172: the second account is in Nicolson’s History of Skye (1930), p. 198. From these accounts it is clear that Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig was a poet and a fiddler (cf. Collinson, Traditional and National Music, p. 63), but there is no indication that he was a harper. The statement in GB, p. 161, that he was a harper is probably based on Maclean Sinclair’s knowledge of the present poem.

Neither of the above accounts gives any reason to think that Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig was in the habit of visiting Banffshire at any time in his life, or that he was in a position to supply Sìleas regularly with detailed gossip about the MacDonalds outside Skye (stt. 3-4).

Above all, as Mr Matheson points out, there is no indication that Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig was blind. He tells us himself in one of his poems:

<gai>Là a’ siubhal sléibhe dhomh
Is mi falbh leam féin gu dlùth,
Gun chuideachd anns an astar sin
Ach gunna glaic is cù,

[TD 177]

Gun thachair clann rium anns a’ ghleann
A’ gal gu fann chion iùil;
Ar leam gum b’iad a b’àillidh dreach
D’ am facas riamh le m’ shùil.<eng>
(BG, p. 145)

A blind man would hardly carry a gun. It is possible that Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig became blind later in life, but again, although Sìleas mentions her subject’s blindness (st. 7), she does not indicate that he ever had his sight, as she might be expected to do if such were the case.

Thus, even if we accept from S that the subject of the poem was named Lachlann Mac Fhionghuin, he is unlikely to be Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig. All we can say about him is that he was connected with Keppoch during the early part of Sìleas’ life (lines 1265-1268), but I can make no suggestion as to his identity.

Line 1330 may suggest that the poem is later than the death of Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh: he was the last of a number of heroes who died and were lamented by Sìleas in lines 807 ff., and he died not before 1721 (cf. Poem no. XIV, Notes). Line 1286 suggests that Mòr and Seònaid, Sìleas’ sisters, were still alive when the poem was written, so that it is unlikely to be later than 1727 (see note below).

Calum Mac Phàrlain says of this poem (MP, p. 437): “De na h-òrain ’s na dàin a rinn Sìleas is e an Cumha a tha’n so am fear is luachmhoire”. See also TGSI XLV, pp. 110-111.


1267. Sìleas probably lived in Banffshire from her marriage about 1685 till her death about 1729 (see Introduction). Cf. SGS X, p. 38.

1274. See above. The fact that Sleat got pride of place in these conversations may be a further manifestation of the tradition (Clan Donald III, p. 168) that the MacDonalds of Sleat were the leaders of Clan Donald.

Mac Phàrlain (MP, p. 438) holds that Sléibhte here is to be interpreted, not as a mere place-name, but as a title for Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh, 11th (4th Baronet) of Sleat, who died in 1718 (cf. line 807 n.); he believes that Dòmhnall and Mairghread in line 1276 are children of Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh. However, Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh had three other daughters, and there seems to be little reason for picking out Mairghread.

It might be better to look on Sléibhte as a place-name, and

[TD 178]

Dòmhnall and Mairghread as Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh and his wife (cf. BG, p. 297). Both The Clan Donald (III, p. 474) and Mackenzie’s History of the Macdonalds (p. 229) state that the wife of Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh was called Mary, but as is pointed out in TGSI XLV, p. 266, this is wrong: early in June 1720, there was presented to the London parliament “A Petition of Margaret M’donald, Widow of the late Sir Donald M’donald of Slate Baronet, for and on behalf of her self, and Mary, Margaret, Isobel and Janet M’donalds, the four Infant Daughters of the late Sir Donald M’donald Baronet …” (The Caledonian Mercury, Tuesday 7/6/1720, p. 106).

1285. Mòr and Seònaid were sisters of Sìleas, see Introduction, Section 1.

Mòr is said (Clan Donald III, p. 421) to have married MacLachlan of MacLachlan, but I have found no corroboration of this. She may have been married to Lachlan MacLachlan, the 14th chief of the family, who succeeded to the title on the death of his father, Gilleasbuig, in 1683 (Grant, Commissariot Record of Argyle. Inventories, p. 29; 28/10/1698), fought at Sheriffmuir, and is said to have been murdered in 1719 (Maclean Sinclair, Celtic Review VIII, p. 335). The MacLachlan lands are in Cowal, Argyllshire.

Seònaid was the wife of Donald Macintyre of Glenoe (Gleann Nodha, which opens on Loch Etive, Argyllshire; not Glencoe, as stated in Mackenzie’s History of the Macdonalds, p. 490), who became head of his family in 1695. Seònaid must have died before 1727, when Donald’s son James was born of a second marriage (see TGSI XVIII, p. 292). In which case, the poem must have been composed before that date.

There is also a tradition which seems to indicate that Mòr and Seònaid died together by drowning in the river Roy near Keppoch (see Introduction, Section 1; Macpherson, Duanaire, p. 98; MB, p. 16).

1287. Sìleas may have had a special interest in Glencoe if, as suggested in the Introduction, she had a sister married to the 12th chief of Glencoe who died in 1692. Cf. line 978.

1296. Cf. line 800.

1301. chéile: here S reads Chlàrsach, which does not give the required aicill with gleusadh; I reads Cheilidh. Angus Matheson notes (TGSI XLI, p. 338) that bagpipes were often referred to in poetry as the piper’s wife or sweetheart; Donnchadh Bàn refers to his guns in the same way (Macleod edn., p. 16).

[TD 179]

1304. chur chiùil: this may be a technical term in music. Compare “cruit Chuircheoil do cheileadh brón” in the Book of the Dean of Lismore; it does not seem to be essential to treat Cuircheol as a proper name (Watson, Scottish Verse, line 1897).

1306-1308. From the context it is clear that the titles given here are those of tunes rather than poems.

Cumha ’n Easbuig may be the tune printed, with variations, in Daniel Dow’s Collection (c. 1775), p. 35, with the title Cumh Easbig Earraghaal or—Bishop of Argyle’s Lament. The Angus Fraser MS contains another tune called Easbuig Earra-ghaidheal—The Bishop of Argyle.

A poem entitled Cumha Ni Mhic Raghnaill is printed in Macpherson’s Duanaire, p. 22, where we are told that the tune for it is that printed in D, p. 12. The poem is a lament for Murt na Ceapaich (1663; see A. M. Mackenzie, Iain Lom, pp. 268 ff.), which led to the accession of Sìleas’ grandfather, Alasdair Buidhe, as chief of Keppoch; it is said to have been composed by an unnamed sister of the murdered youths to mourn their loss. The Rev. William Matheson points out to me, however, that the title Cumha Nì Mhic Raghnaill should mean “Lament for (not by) Nì Mhic Raghnaill” (cf. BG, p. 297), and that Macpherson clearly applied this title to the poem in his Duanaire merely because he had seen the title in the Stewarts’ version of the present poem. I thus have no evidence as to what tune Sìleas had in mind. Cf. also TGSI XLV, p. 110.

Cumha Màiri may be the tune which appears as a pìobaireachd in the Piobaireachd Society’s Piobaireachd, p. 155, entitled Cumha Mairi Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh. This poetess died not before 1705 (Watson edn., p. xiv), and Mr Seumas MacNeill of the College of Piping, Glasgow, informs me that it is generally believed by pipers that this tune was composed by Patrick Og MacCrimmon (c. 1645–1730), who was a friend of Màiri; that the tune shows all the signs of belonging to this period; that it is unusually melodic for a pìobaireachd, and therefore likely to appeal to harpers. It is thus likely that Lachlann Dall had played a version of this tune for Sìleas.

Cumha Ghilleasbuig is probably the lament composed by Iain Lom on the death of Sìleas’ father in 1682 (Mackenzie edn., p. 164); but no tune for this poem seems to have been noted. Cf. TGSI XLV, p. 110.

[TD 180]

1309-1310. The Rev. William Matheson, who has studied these musical terms, concludes that Socair Dhàna is syllabic verse (dàn) in its musical aspect; the term is explained in Kennedy’s Laoidheadair Gaelic, p. 84, as “common measure”, and in the Angus Fraser MS as “musical recitation”; Kennedy (op. cit. p. 102) gives a list of poems with tunes in Socair Dhàna, and they are all laments. Óran, or amhran, which is also used as a metrical term (BG, p. liv), denotes the more popular type of tune, usually constructed on an ABBA pattern like that of Poem no. II here, and associated with stress (non-syllabic) poetry. Cumha (lament) and Fàilte (salutation) are, Mr Matheson suggests, sub-types of Óran, probably distinguished on the basis of tonality (the musical modes in which they are composed) rather than on that of metre or rhythm (cf. Joseph MacDonald, Compleat Theory, p. 23).

1317. rùsgadh: the exact meaning of this word is not clear; it appears in both sources, and is confirmed by the rhyme with cùis. Perhaps the implication is that in some metaphorical sense the harp has been damaged by Lachlann’s death.

1330. This may refer to the deaths of Ailein Mùideartach (1715), Dòmhnall a’ Chogaidh (1718), his son Sir Donald (1719), his brother Sir James (1720), and Alasdair Dubh Gleanna Garadh (1721 or 1724; cf. line 807 n.).


XXII. [CEÒL NA CLÀRSAICH]

This poem is taken from I, where, unlike any other poem there, it has no title or other heading; it follows immediately after the version of Poem no. XXI, separated from it only by a few ink lines. It is given in the form of two eight-line stanzas.

Various surmises as to the implications of the poem are possible. K. D. MacDonald says (AM, p. 83) that the poem suggests “that Sìlis herself played the harp, but that its music was no longer tolerated in the household—there may have been a reaction to the traditional culture of which the harp was a part when Sìlis’ son, James, succeeded to his father’s estates”.

The poem may also be considered as, in some sense, a sequel to Poem no. XXI, for the opening lines suggest a reply to Slàn a chaoidh le ceòl na clàrsaich, the last line of no. XXI; this might explain the poem’s position in I. The implication might then be that some time after the death of Lachlann Dall

[TD 181]

(Poem no. XXI), Sìleas again came in contact with the harp, perhaps by a single visit from another harper, and wished (lines 1341-1342) that she could afford to retain a permanent harper.


1337. iuchair: the word seems strange in the context, as its most appropriate meaning here might be “musical key”, a meaning which iuchair does not normally have; but Sìleas may be consciously using a translation of the English term. A more acceptable meaning would be the “key” used for altering the pitch of the strings, but this does not fit the context so well.

1339. chom: according to Dwelly (s.v. clàrsach) com is the technical term for the “chest” or sounding-box of the harp.

1345-1346. A shift of the comma from after beus to after fiodhull, as in the MS, alters the translation to: “Dearer than fiddle—and I shall not mention the attributes of the organ—”.


XXIII. AM BÀS IS FLATHANAS

This merry ditty is here based on the version in I, which may be the only extant independent source for it, if, as seems likely, the version in CW is derived from I (see Sources and Readings). The CW version is published with emendations in LS p. 21. Both manuscripts ascribe the poem to Sìleas.

It comprises two main sections, one (stt. 1-7) on death and decomposition, and the other on Heaven; a poem with a similar outlook on death, which Sìleas could have known, appears in the Fernaig MS (Mac Phàrlain edn., p. 12; Rel. Celt. II, p. 9).

I have no evidence for dating the present poem (though line 1411 may indicate that Sìleas considered she had now had a long life), and its position here is arbitrary.


1366. Cf. the lines occurring as part of a charm in TGSI XVII, p. 239:

<gai>’S e ’n t-suil a chi
’S e ’n cridhe a smuainicheas,
’S e ’n teanga ’labhras.<eng>

1372. Hell is referred to as being cold also in poetry earlier than Sìleas’ time, as in the Fernaig MS (Mac Phàrlain edn.),

[TD 182]

p. 27, st. 7; on p. 89, st. 18, we have: “Dh’ ifrinn fhuair am bi fuachd is teas”; and on p. 339, st. 15, we hear of “ifrinn fuar fliuch”. This idea seems to have been especially common in early Gaelic literature, see Stith Thompson, Motif-Index, A671.3 to A671.3.3; Royal Irish Academy, Contributions to a Dictionary of the Irish Language, Fasc. U, col. 29, lines 36 ff.

1394. air ’n amhluidh: translated here (without authority) as “alike”. We might substitute “air ’n amaladh”, “fitted together, constructed”, or the expression may contain the word amalaidh, which, Kenneth MacDonald informs me, is common in folk-tales in phrases like “cathair amalaidh òir”. But the amhluidh of the sources gives the best rhyme with cabhsairean.

II. COMHAIRLE AIR NA NIGHEANAN ÒGA

This poem is found in three primary sources: ML 7, I, p. 23, and T, p. 296; of these, I and T ascribe it to Sìleas. I has been copied into K, p. 40, and T into Me, p. 29.

I contains only stt. 5-8. T has 8 stanzas in the following order: 1, 3, 9, 6, 8, 5, 7, and a stanza made up of the first half of st. 2 and the second half of st. 4. ML is the only source for the remainder of these two stanzas, and for st. 10.

The text here follows ML where possible, otherwise occasionally using T and I. The readings given below are the more significant divergences in I, T and ML, plus a few alterations suggested by K.

There is no title or ascription in ML.

III. CÒMHRADH RIS A’ BHÀS

I have three independent versions of this poem:

1. The lost MS of Iain Bàn Innse (c. 1800), from which it was copied three times by Fr Allan MacDonald, into A, p. 89, into CW, p. 119, and into LS, p. 19.

2. I, p. 43.

3. H 27/6/1879, p. 6 (no source named).

St. 6 is lacking in H, which also inserts st. 9 after st. 5. Stt. 3-9 are marked “Ise” and “Bàs” in CW, A and LS, “Sile” and “An t-Aog” in H; there is no such marking in I.

A and LS show few divergences from CW, which is mainly followed here where the metre allows; readings from CW below are usually those of A and LS also.

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in CW, p. 222 (cf. Campbell, The Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 103, 105), I and H.

IV. DO RÌGH SEUMAS

This poem appears in two sources which, apparently, are independent, I, p. 14 and T, p. 106, both of which ascribe it to Sìleas. There are no major differences between the two versions, and in the minor divergences the text here given follows I as far as possible.

V. DO DH’FHEACHD MHORAIR MÀR

I have this poem from three sources: I, p. 1, T, p. 135 and GB, p. 168; GB omits st. 13. I and T are primary sources, and GB may also be so: the differences between GB and the others could be due to the former’s having been obtained in America. But most of the differences are also consistent with being emendations to the text of T; one such emendation may be the omission of st. 13, another the (desirable) change of title. The version in MP, p. 442, seems to be copied with some alterations from T. Both T and GB were used to provide the version in BG, p. 125 (see p. xii). All sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas. The text here mainly follows that of T.

VII. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (2)

My only source for this poem is GS20 (1894), p. 15, where it is printed by the Rev. A. Maclean Sinclair, presumably from an American source. I have simply copied the poem from there, with a few spelling alterations. A widely divergent version of st. 2 appears in CT, p. 242, where it is attributed to Domhnull Mac Raonuill; this is copied in MB, p. 23, and is given here in the Notes.

IX. DO DH’ARM RÌGH SHEUMAIS

This poem comes from two primary sources, I, p. 20, and T, p. 157, both of which ascribe it to Sìleas. T contains only three stanzas (1, 2, 6) and has been copied in SO, p. 60, in MP, p. 445, and in Guth na Bliadhna, Vol. XII (1915), p. 107.

XI. CUMHA BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

This poem appears in five independent sources: I, p. 9; D, p. 36; H 27/6/1879, p. 6; GS20, p. 17; MB, p. 93. Of these, I and D probably derive ultimately from the recitation of John MacDonald of Dalchosnie, Rannoch (see Abbreviations and Sources); GS20 is from a Nova Scotia source; H may be from the lost Iain Bàn MS from which the version of Poem no. XIX in H is taken; and MB may be from the same source as the MB version of Poem no. XIX, oral tradition in the Fort Augustus area collected in 1899.

Only I has a complete text, and the others have the stanzas as follows:
D: 5, 1, 2, 3, 9, 8.
H: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 9.
GS20: 1, 2, 3, 7.
MB: 2, 3, 4, 7.

In GS20 and MB the final stanza is really a mixture of stanzas 6 and 7 as given here.

The text followed here is that of I, with an alteration to the order of stanzas: I and D begin the poem with stanza 5, but since this stanza is addressed to Sìleas’ husband it seems more proper to place it beside the other stanzas addressed to him, as is done in H.

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in all the sources except D, which ascribes it to one “Lilias of Clanranald”, who did not exist (see MP, p. 436).

The text of GS20 has been reprinted in SGS X, p. 40, and that of D by Mac Phàrlain in The Celtic Monthly, Vol. XVI (1908), p. 100, and again in MP, p. 437.

In D the poem is accompanied by a tune, and by an English poem which bears little relation to the Gaelic text.

XII. LAOIDH AIR BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

I have this poem from two sources: I, p. 33 and MC, p. 82. The Rev. A. Macdonald of Killearnan, one of the editors of MC, saw I in 1914, when he copied K from it, but I have no reason to think that he had seen I before MC was published

[TD 197]

in 1911, or that the version of the present poem in MC derives from that in I. There are, however, few textual divergences between I and MC, both of which ascribe the poem to Sìleas. Stanza 2 was copied from MC in MP, p. 436.

XIII. MARBHRANN

I have seen twelve copies of this poem, only one of which is complete, and six of which may be independent sources:

1. MD, p. 154, which contains the chorus (headed “Am fonn”), followed by stt. 1, 4, 11, 5. There is no ascription.

2. ML MS 146, which contains the chorus followed by stt. 1, 2, 4, 6-12, 14, 13. There is no indication that the chorus is a chorus, and no stanza division between it and stt. 1, 2 and 4, or between stt. 6, 7 and 8.

3. ML MS 212, which contains only a copy of st. 13, virtually identical with the version of it in ML, MS 146, followed by the first line of the chorus. There is no title or ascription. This source is not quoted in the readings below.

4. G, p. 141, for which ML was certainly one source (see SGS VIII, p. 180), but the text here is occasionally different from that of ML MS 146. The order of stanzas is: 1, Chorus, 2 (followed by direction to repeat chorus), 4, 6-14. G was copied in IC, p. 186, and one or both of these provided the version in SO, p. 58, where the text has been amended in places. SO is quoted in MB, p. 18. The version in D, p. 28, gives st. 1, Chorus, stt. 2 and 4, plus the tune and an English verse translation; the words are copied, complete with a misprint, from SO. These words are again copied from D by Mac Phàrlain in The Celtic Monthly, Vol. XVI (1908), p. 240, and in MP, p. 435.

5. I, p. 11, which is the only text including all the stanzas given here; it is the only source for st. 3. The chorus is given at the beginning (headed “Corus”) and at the end. Stt. 1 and 2 appear in the reverse order, but have been renumbered as here; the rest of the poem follows in the order given here. There have been numerous alterations in Irvine’s handwriting, especially to the numbering of stanzas, and to words in the later part of the poem. Some of these alterations result in texts otherwise found only in G (e.g. lines 780 and 784, see below), so that it is likely that Irvine saw a copy of G after writing his manuscript. Stt. 8 and 9 appear, so numbered, on a separate piece of paper pasted into the manuscript.

6. GS20, p. 18, which contains st. 1, Chorus, stt. 2, 4, 6 and 14 (headed “Last verse”). This is part of a version recorded by Maclean Sinclair, presumably in America.

XIV. ALASDAIR A GLEANNA GARADH

I have five primary sources for this poem, none of which includes the whole of st. 9:

N, p. 8, where each pair of lines is written as a single line, and the lines occur in the following order: 799-830, 839-846, 833-834, 831-832, 835-838, 847-862, 867-870. There is no title or ascription.

MD, p. 108, which has stt. 1-5 as here, then lines 841-842, 839-840, 845-848, making a sixth stanza. Lines 843-844 are missing. The seventh stanza comprises lines 849-856, and the eighth lines 857-862, 867-868.

ML MS 120, twenty-third page. Stt 1-3, 5-8 as here, then lines 867-868 isolated. The text has some alterations, obviously based on a version similar to MD. There is no title or ascription.

E, p. 286. Stt. 1-8 as here, but lines 867-870 are added to to st. 8. The text is close to that of ML.

MN MS 6. Stt. 1-3, 5-8 as here; no title or ascription. The text is very close to that of ML.

[TD 202]

There was also a copy of this poem in the lost Glengarry MS which Ewen MacLachlan saw at the National Library. In copying poems from it into Nat. Lib. MS LXXXI (present shelf-mark 72.3.3) he excluded the present poem because it was already printed in “Campbell p. 50”, by which he probably means IC (cf. Mackinnon, Catalogue, p. 330).

The only source I have for the complete st. 9 is GS20, p. 19, where it is supplied alone by Maclean Sinclair from an American source.

Most of the printed versions of this poem derive ultimately from E, or from ET, p. 300. These include the versions in IC, p. 50, Me, p. 178, SO, p. 59 and MP, p. 447. SO is quoted (one stanza) in MB, p. 18, and SO and GS20 together provide the version in Orain a’ Mhoid IV, p. 7 (some of the words of this version appear, probably earlier, in The Celtic Monthly, Vol. XI, 1903, p. 80, edited by “Fionn”; and in An Deo-Greine, Vol. IV, 1909, p. 132). The version in BG, p. 128 is based on N, E and SO (see p. ix), the final stanza appearing in the third edition (1959) from GS20.

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in MD, E and GS20.

XV. AN AGHAIDH NA H-OBAIR NODHA

I have this poem from two sources, both of which ascribe it to Sìleas: I, p. 25, and S, p. 366. S is copied in Me, p. 129, and contains stt. 1-8, 10-12. The stanzas contained in I are: 1, 8, 5, 6, 9, 13, 2, 4, 3, 14. In those stanzas which occur in both sources S is followed here, and the positioning of the stanzas which occur only in I is conjectural. A series of crosses in the MS (I) indicates that four lines of st. 9 are missing.

Stanza 2 has been recorded by John MacInnes for the School of Scottish Studies, sung by Donald Sinclair (Dòmhnall Chaluim Bàin), Baile a’ Phuill, Tiree, on two separate occasions (1969 and 1970). The words used differ a little in the two performances, the earlier of which is closer to the present text and is referred to below as SS1; the later is referred to as SS2.

XVI. LAOIDH NA MAIDNE

The only source I have for this poem is ML MS 165, eleventh page, where it is ascribed to Sìleas. From there it is printed in AM, p. 84.

Title:

XVII. LAOIDH AN T-SOLUIS

The only source I know for this poem is the lost Iain Bàn MS of c. 1800, from which it was copied three times by Fr Allan MacDonald: into CW, p. 118, into A, p. 87, and into LS, p. 17; see Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 102-108. A few alterations to the text of CW appear in LS, and the text of CW is mainly followed here. A agrees with LS except where otherwise stated.

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in CW, p. 222, and there is no other ascription.

XVIII. LAOIDH NA H-OIDHCHE

This poem is taken from CW, p. 113 (page wrongly numbered 116 in MS), where it was copied by Fr Allan MacDonald from the lost MS of Iain Bàn; from this Fr Allan also copied stt. 1-4 into A, p. 85, and into LS, p. 18, see J. L. Campbell, Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 102-105. In this case the texts of A and LS are identical. Only CW contains stt. 5-8, which appear in the following order: 5, 7, 6, 8. Stanza 8 is not numbered, and is followed by “&c.”

The poem is ascribed to Sìleas in CW, p. 222 (cf. Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 103).

Titles:
Laoidh na h-Oidhche CW (p. 222), LS.

XIX. LAOIDH MHOIRE MHAIGHDEAN

I have used seven independent sources for this poem:

ML MS 47, which has no title or ascription. The quatrains are numbered but not separated. Stanza 4 is missing, and stt. 6 and 7 are given in the reverse order. Lines 1175-1176 are given before lines 1173-1174.

I, pp. 36-40. Most of the quatrains are written separately but

[TD 209]

numbered in pairs, while stt. 9-14 are written as eight-line stanzas. Stt. 4 and 5 appear in the reverse order, as do stt. 6 and 7. Two slightly different versions of stt. 13, 14 and 21 are given. Lines 1175-1176 come before lines 1173-1174, line 1178 before line 1177. Stt. 8-10 and stt. 13-14 (second version) appear on a separate slip, numbered “2”, between pages 36 and 37.

LC, pp. 109-115, where M’Coinnich has interpolated large passages himself. Here the poem is in unnumbered eight-line stanzas, the lines occurring being: 1081-1092, 1097-1100, 1093-1096, 1105-1108, 1101-1104, 1109-1160, 1165-1168, 1177-1178, 1175-1176, 1173-1174, 1181-1184.

IA, p. 4 (June 1874), where the text was supplied to the contributor by “Mr A. R. Fraser, Kingussie, who took it down from the recitation of an old lady in Badenoch a few months ago”. The text appears again in GS7, p. 115, supplied by William Mackenzie. There is no division of stanzas. The lines occurring are: 1081-1092, 1097-1100, 1093-1096, 1109-1112, 1121, 1142, 1145-1160.

H 25/7/1879, p. 6, contributed by D. C. Macpherson, who says it “was copied from a MS. left by the late Mr John Macdonell (Iain Ban), of Keppoch, who took it down from the recitation of one of Sile’s servants, about the end of last century”. This was copied by Colin Chisholm in GS12, p. 162. The poem appears in the same form in LS, p. 12, and it is possible that Fr Allan drew it from the same lost Ian Bàn MS used by Macpherson; we know that Fr Allan possessed a MS attributed to Iain Bàn, and from it copied his versions of Poems III, XVII, XVIII, XX and XXIII. But we cannot be sure that Macpherson and Fr Allan were using the same MS; while Fr Allan copied the poems mentioned above from his Iain Bàn MS into CW, his version of the present poem in CW is from another source (see below). The version in GS12 was available to him (cf. Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 108, n. 5).

The poem appears in eight-line stanzas in H. Stt. 4 and 5 are in the reverse order, as are stt. 6 and 7. St. 1 is repeated at the end to complete the last eight-line stanza.

CW MS 61, pp. 18 ff. (the MS is not paginated), where it was written down about 1883 by Fr Allan MacDonald from a native of Eigg living in Oban (see Titles below, and Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 108). There are numerous alterations in

[TD 210]

the text, which is written in unnumbered quatrains. Stt. 4 and 5 appear in the reverse order, as do stt. 6 and 7. Stt. 21-23 appear on p. 24 of the MS with a note that they are to be inserted between stt. 19 and 20 on p. 23. Lines 1175-1176 appear before lines 1173-1174.

MB, p. 92, where the version was taken down by Josephine MacDonell from Archibald MacArthur, Fort Augustus, in September 1899. There is no title, and the poem is given in eight-line stanzas. The lines occur as follows: 1081-1086, 1088, 1093-1100, 1089-1092, 1105-1108, 1101-1104, 1109-1112; then eight lines which must be a version of lines 1113-1120, but which differ greatly from the other versions of these lines; 1125-1156, 1169-1172, 1157-1160, 1173-1175; then three lines which do not occur elsewhere; 1177-1182; then three more lines not found elsewhere; 1188.

The poem is still known in oral tradition, and other recent independent versions are available, see Notes.

It is ascribed to Sìleas in I, IA, H, CW (p. 222) and MB.

XX. AN EAGLAIS

I know of two primary sources for this poem: the lost MS of Iain Bàn Innse from which it was copied into CW, p. 115, and H 27/6/1879, p. 6, where only part of it appears, with no source named. H contains lines 1189-1212, 1221-1224, 1223-1224 (repeated), 1213-1215; 1225-1232 as fifth stanza; 1233-1238, 1247-1248, and 1251-1252 as sixth stanza; and 1253-1260. H was reprinted, with a few minor alterations, in GS12, p. 165. The version in LS, p. 23, is mostly from that of CW, but there are a few readings from GS12 (cf. The Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 102-105).

I follow CW here, with occasional readings from H. Both sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas (CW on p. 222, cf. Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 103).

XXII. [CEÒL NA CLÀRSAICH]

My only source for this poem is I, p. 32, which ascribes it to Sìleas. There is no title. The poem is written as two eight-line stanzas, and follows immediately after Poem no XXI. It is printed from I in AM, p. 83.

XXIII. AM BÀS IS FLATHANAS

This poem is taken from I, p. 40, and from CW p. 138; the latter is published, with emendations, in LS, p. 21. The source of the CW version has not yet been discovered (cf. Innes Review, Vol. 7, pp. 105-108), but it can be argued that it derives, perhaps indirectly, from I.

There is no significant difference between the two texts, and the text of CW is consistent with having been copied from that of I with spelling alterations and one or two minor textual emendations. It may also be significant that CW breaks off at line 1400, which is the last line on p. 42 of I. In line 1386 both I and CW have the word rilleanan (here and in LS altered to drithleanan). This word does not seem to occur in the dictionaries, and if it is merely an error for drithleanan in I, then its occurrence in CW proves that the latter is copied, directly or indirectly, from I, although I have not found any evidence that Fr Allan MacDonald ever saw the Irvine MSS. If this is so, then I is our only primary source for this poem.

In I, lines 1349-1380 are given in eight-line stanzas, the remainder in four-line stanzas. There is no stanza division in CW.

Both sources ascribe the poem to Sìleas, CW on p. 222.

METRES AND TUNES

I. DO MHÀIRI A NIGHEAN

The form of the poem given here is based on my interpretation of stanza 2 in the MS. The entire poem is written in couplets, numbered as here, but st. 2 is written as follows:—

(2)
’S ribbainan air uachdar ort
Cho uallach ’s tha ’n Duneidin
Mo Mharie, &c.
Sribbainan &c.

From this I surmise that each couplet except the first is to be followed by the refrain and (except the first and last) repeated.

This arrangement, however, means that the poem does not fit into any of the sub-types of Type II of James Ross’ classification of song-metres (Éigse VII, pp. 231 ff.). The construction of the poem in separate couplets places it in a type which J. L. Campbell (MacCormick Collection, p. 199) considers to be fairly recent; a type later used by Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair and Donnchadh Bàn for literary waulking songs.

In the present poem there are two stresses per line, the second stress of the first line of the couplet assonating or rhyming (a type of rhyme earlier known as aicill) with a word in the second line. But the rhyming word in the second line is not always that which we would consider stressed, as in st. 10, where biodag does not seem to fall on either stress, yet forms aicill with Ghriogair. This probably means, the Rev. W. Matheson tells me, that the lost tune to which the poem was sung had a stress pattern different from that of the words, consisting of eight stresses per couplet instead of four. Cf. Poem no. XXI in the MacCormick Collection, and Poem no. XXIII here.

[TD 224]

II. COMHAIRLE AIR NA NIGHEANAN ÒGA

[Ceòl]

The metre of this poem, as printed, has significant resemblances to the medieval syllabic metre called Ochtfhoclach bec (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 71). Each stanza here contains eight lines, each couplet of which has internal rhymes as indicated below (st. 5):

Mar shamhladh bruadair an diugh ’ga luaidh rium,
Gun dad de bhuanachd ach buaidh mar ghnàth.

Often the same vowel continues in this internal rhyme for two couplets (as st. 5) or three (st. 2), or an entire stanza (stt. 4, 6). The final stressed word of each couplet rhymes throughout the stanza. A more perfect example of this metre is Donnchadh Bàn’s Oran Coire a’ Cheathaich (Macleod edn., p. 164), and a less perfect example is Poem no. VIII here.

The main stresses of the tune (the tonic stresses following the bar-lines) correspond with the rhyming words bruadair, luaidh rium, bhuanachd and ghnàth in the example above; similarly with m’ aimsir, bargan, ’g earbsa and orm as written

[TD 225]

with the music above. But the fourth internal rhyme of the couplet (buaidh mar; cealgte) is quite independent of the tonic-stress pattern of the tune, which corresponds with the stress-pattern of the words. Thus it seems to me possible that this fourth rhyming element has survived from the syllabic Ochtfhoclach bec into a later metre which has no need of it. Many poems, accordingly, dispense with this fourth rhyme, e.g. Poem no. VIII here and Mi ’m shuidhe am ònar mentioned below. Modern Irish poems based on the same original syllabic metre seem likewise to have discarded it (Murphy, loc. cit.).

Other European forms of the same metre are discussed by W. P. Ker in Form and Style in Poetry, pp. 219-229, where he says (p. 224): “Without a doubt, it is the music that has kept it alive”.

The tune given above is adapted from the School of Scottish Studies’ transcription of that sung by Donald Joseph Mackinnon, Barra, on their tape SA1951/4, to the words of Mi ’m shuidhe am ònar air tulaich bhòidhich. The adaptation of the transcription to fit the present words has involved considerable regularisation of the tune to avoid the ornaments and irregularities used by the singer for the words of Mi ’m shuidhe am ònar, and I have also added G sharp to the key signature, because where G occurs in the tune I heard it as sharp on the tape.

On p. 296 of T we are told the tune of the present poem: “Fonn.—Mi shuidhe ’m onar, air tulaich bhoidheach, &c.” The words from which this tune takes its name were written shortly before 1786, when they were first published in G, p. 195 (cf. Sinclair, Òranaiche, p. 437; An Gaidheal I, 1873, p. 54); their author was Somhairle Camshron of Bun-chadain near Ceannloch Raineach, Perthshire, who died about 1792, see TGSI XVII, pp. 151-152.

In addition to the version used here, the School of Scottish Studies has at least three other recordings of the song from Barra, to tunes which may be variants of that used here, and John MacInnes tells me that he has recorded in Perthshire a different song set to a tune which the singer called Mi ’m shuidhe am ònar, and that this again may be a variant of the tune above.

In all the printed sources of the words of Mi ’m shuidhe am ònar (except G) we are told that the tune to which these words

[TD 226]

are sung is that of Òran Coire a’ Cheathaich (see Orain a’ Mhòid, Vol. XVI, p. 11; Patrick MacDonald’s Collection, no. 132). Another tune set to these words appears in Coisir a’ Mhòid, Vol. I, p. 57, the tune’s proper title being Tighearna Òg Dhungallain (see An Deo-Ghreine, Vol. V, p. 123). While both these tunes will fit the words of the present poem, the Rev. William Matheson doubts if either has any long-standing connection with Camshron’s poem. In TGSI XLI, pp. 16-17, he suggests that the proper tune for it (and therefore for Sìleas’ poem) may be that appearing as Tha mo chion air an ùr ghibht in Patrick MacDonald’s Collection of 1784, no. 101, and in S. Fraser’s Collection of 1816, no. 196.


III. CÒMRADH RIS A’ BHÀS

This poem is syllabic, though the number of syllables to the line, as given here, is not strictly regular. Basically, stt. 1-5 have seven syllables to the line, with final monosyllabic word; this corresponds to the Bardic metre rannaigecht mór (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 52). Stt. 6-12, by the addition of one syllable to the final word, have eight syllables to the line, the final stressed word being disyllabic, and this corresponds to rannaigecht bec mór. (Murphy, p. 54). Throughout the poem the only fairly regular ornaments are the final rhyme between the second and fourth lines of each stanza (in stt. 7-12 consistently on an à-sound), and the aicill (e.g. in st. 8 rìreadh: sìneadh, and ìsleadh: sìth ri) which occurs in both couplets of each stanza, in the manner of the later bards.


IV. DO RÌGH SEUMAS

[Ceòl]

[TD 227]

[Ceòl]

[TD 228]

It is clear that the sense of the refrain lines in this song is in no way relevant to that of the song proper; therefore the song must be modelled on an older song in which the same refrain lines occurred and were relevant to the text. Such a song is Nach truagh leat mi ’s mi ’m prìosan, Mo Mhaili bheag Ò, versions of which are easily found, e.g. in S, p. 124; Munro’s Am Filidh, p. 48; SO, p. 367; D, p. 57; Am Filidh Gaidhealach, p. 65; Coisir a’ Mhòid I, p. 39. This song is traditionally associated with the reign of King William (1689–1702) or thereabouts (SO, p. 368; Creighton & Macleod, Gaelic Songs in Nova Scotia, p. 264), and the chances are that Sìleas modelled her song on it with the intention that it be sung to the same tune. It can thus hardly be said that the poem is addressed to her daughter Màiri (cf. Poem no. I), though the choice of this particular model may possibly have been influenced by her daughter’s name, of which Maili is a familiar form.

Of the four tunes given above, the barring used in (b) and (d) seems preferable to that of (a) and (c), because the final rhymes in (b) and (d) fall on the tonic stresses (indicated by bars) of the music.

All four tunes are taken from settings of Nach truagh leat mi ’s mi ’m prìosan, for I have not seen music set specifically to Sìleas’ words. Tune (a) is taken from D, p. 57, where we are told that the tune is called Grammachree. Dun assures us in his Appendix, p. 3, that though the tune was popular also in Ireland and the Lowlands, the version he gives is a Highland one. Tune (b) is from Coisir a’ Mhòid I, p. 39 (cf. Celtic Magazine, V, p. 247) and tune (c) from Munro’s Filidh, Appendix, p. 9. Musicologists may decide that tunes (a), (b) and (c) are all ultimately variants of the same basic tune.

Certainly there is considerable evidence of a long-standing connection between Grammachree and Mo Mhaili bheag Ò(g). Mention of Irish tunes in connection with the latter is made in SO, p. 368, and D, Appendix, p. 3. Grammachree is often named as the tune to which Thomas Moore (1779–1852) wrote his famous song The Harp that Once (1903 edition, p. 24), but it now seems clear that the version of the tune actually used by Moore is that printed in Bunting’s 1840 Collection of Irish music under the title of Molly My Treasure (p. 46). Other variants of the same tune appear in the same collection as Molli Astore (p. 17) and Little Molly O! (p. 67); on p. 17 this last

[TD 229]

version is referred to as “the very ancient air of ‘Molly Bheag O’”. I have found no indication of a Scottish origin for any of Bunting’s versions of the tune, but neither have I found any Irish set of words with the refrain Mo Mhaili Bheag Ò, apart from some Ulster verses published by Ó Muirgheasa (Céad de Cheoltaibh Uladh, p. 88; Dhá Chéad, p. 383).

A version of the Grammachree tune is printed in Goodman’s Irish Minstrel No. 2 under the title “Malluighe bheag O”. An admittedly Irish poem (in English) with the refrain line Ah! gramachree, mo challeenouge, mo Molly astore appears in Johnson’s Scots Musical Museum, Vol. I (1787), p. 47.

In 1819 Sir John Sinclair published a paper or pamphlet entitled Evidence to prove that the celebrated air, called “Grammachree Molly” was composed in Scotland (see his son’s account of his life, Vol. II, p. 406); I have failed to locate this publication, but its title may further verify the connection between Mo Mhaili bheag Ò and Grammachree. For other poems to this tune see Stenhouse, Illustrations, p. 51. Cf. also The Letters of Burns (London, 1819), Vol. I, p. 63.

Tune (d) is taken from Creighton & Macleod, Gaelic Songs, p. 262, where it is printed as sung in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. It can hardly be questioned that it is a variant of the tune used more often for Gum bu slàn a chì mi mo chailinn dìleas donn (S. Fraser’s Collection, no. 78, p. 39). This song has the same metrical pattern as the Mo Mhaili bheag Ó songs, and the association of the tune with the latter is probably fairly recent. Tune (d) is hexatonic.

For notes on the metrical pattern and its relation to music see W. P. Ker, Form and Style, pp. 212 ff.


V. DO DH’FHEACHD MHORAIR MÀR

[Ceòl]

[TD 230]

[Ceòl]

The verses of this poem are limericks, i.e. each contains five lines, of which lines 1, 2 and 5 contain three stresses each, lines 3 and 4 two stresses each, the feet being basically dactyls. In musical and metrical duration lines 3 and 4 are together equivalent to one of the other lines. Lines 1, 2 and 5 are connected by monosyllabic rhyme, lines 3 and 4 by disyllabic rhyme; the finals of lines 3 and 4 also rhyme, as a form of aicill, with the second stress of line 5, e.g.:

Gu ceannard a’ Bhràghad
’S a’ chuid eile de m’ chàirdibh:
Buaidh shìthne ’s buaidh làrach leibh chaoidh.
(st. 6)

See BG, p. lxii. Rhyme connecting the first stresses of lines 3, 4 and 5 (or any two of these) occurs occasionally, as in st. 14—cluinneam: philleadh: chinneach.

O’Sullivan, discussing Irish and English limericks in his Bunting Collection, Vol. I, p. 31, distinguishes three types of limerick by their rhyming and rhythmical patterns, and the present poem has some of the features of all three. His Type BII is best known from the works of the Maigue (Co. Limerick) poets, especially Seán Ó Tuama (c. 1706–1775), and O’Sullivan believes (p. 32) that the model for Irish folk-songs of this type is not older than the beginning of the eighteenth century. There are additional forms of the limerick in Irish literature, but none corresponds, as far as I can see, in exact metre and rhyme-pattern to the present poem, which may well be the earliest extant datable limerick poem in Gaelic, Scottish or Irish.

The tune given here is taken from the Angus Fraser MS,

[TD 231]

the only source I know for it. It appears under the title “Blàr Sliabh an t-Siorradh—The battle of Sheriffmuir” in the “Vocal Airs” MS, p. 48, no. 110, and in the “Music of Caledonia” MS, no. 63. It is given above exactly as it appears in the first, except that I have fitted the words to the first of the three sections, and have also written the quavers and semiquavers in this section separately, to facilitate fitting the words to them; in the MS this section appears in a notation form similar to that of the other sections. In the MS the first note here fitted to the word bròn is not dotted. Fraser’s note on the tune (Notes, p. 56) is as follows:

Nº 63 Air

The song to this air was Composed by Julia McDonnell of Keppoch on the battle of Sheriff Muir. She was a warm partizan in the Jacobite Cause, and her sentiments are here Communicated. The air is regular, and seems from its structure as if the strains had been composed to be sung simultaneously. The rhythm of airs of this Class has puzzled the first noters of them in modern times in consequence of the difference between the strictly instrumental and vocal forms of them as sung in the highlands.—I have here given the instrumental form.—But in consequence of a requirement in songs and recitations that the rests placed after the second & fourth lines of a stanza shall be longer than those placed after the first and third lines, the air for the song should be written in 3/8, and the 4th, 8 & 12th regions of each strain omitted in the measure.—It will then resemble an iambic tripling except in the passing notes. Several familiar Scottish & Irish airs are derived from the iambic sextupling such as:

Here’s a health to ane I loe dear.
I loe ne’er a laddie but ane.
Here’s to the year that’s awa.
What ails this heart o’ mine.
Kate Kearney.
Garry Owen.
My lodging is on the cold ground.

The short Metre of the Psalms had its origin in this variation & its modifications.

[TD 232]

By resolving the triplets in this kind of air into dactyles it is adapted to the so called “Dactylic Pentameter Verse” of the ancients, which consists of two feet and a half repeated,—but this is probably a misnomer for it.—See Nº 47 Air, an Elegy by William Ross [Oran Eile, SO, p. 297].


Fraser’s suggestion that the three sections (“strains”) he gives should be sung simultaneously is probably to be rejected, for to do this would result in discord in the first half of the tune, and unison in the second.

The second section above (after the first double bar) looks more like an alternative for the first, such as might have been supplied by Fraser’s instrumental source. The third section might form the second part of a single tune (the first or second section providing the first part); if so, perhaps the complete tune covered two stanzas instead of one. The third section above is certainly reminiscent of the second part of the Irish limerick tune for Tá an Coileach ag fógairt an Lae (Ó Tuama, An Chóisir Cheoil I, p. 3), in which the words of the second part are simply a repetition of those of the first part.

If the tune seems rather too merry for the words of the first line, it should be remembered that the over-all spirit of the poem, despite the first line, is not at all gloomy, and that the limerick rhythm itself is a distinctly lively one.


VI. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (1)

In the absence of a tune it is difficult to establish the metrical stress-pattern of this poem. The poem is clearly of the type called “strophic” in BG, pp. xlv ff., that is, each couplet, or strophe, is made up of three phrases of the same duration whose final words rhyme, plus one shorter phrase (simply the word riamh in the example below) whose final stress rhymes with the finals of the other strophes in the poem; e.g. st. 4:

Bha buaidh làrach aig mo chàirdibh
Mar a b’ àbhaist riamh.

Poem no. II is in another form of “strophic” metre. In the present poem, however, the length of the line varies greatly, as does the number of potentially stressed words, so that probably

[TD 233]

only the tune could make clear the rhythm of the poem and the location of stresses. It seems likely that the words were written to the pattern of a tune rather than to that of a formal stress system; only this, I think, could explain the variation in line length.


VII. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (2)

This poem, or at least some version of it, was sung (CT, p. 242), but I have not found the tune.

The metre would be classified by Watson (BG, pp. lx ff.) as a four-stress amhran, each couplet being considered as a single long line. As given here, each line has two stresses, and in each couplet the first line generally has ultimate stress, the second penultimate. In each stanza there is rhyme between lines 2, 4, 6 and 8 (and 10 in st. 2), and rhyme may also connect lines 1 and 3, or lines 5 and 7. The final stress of the first line of a couplet forms an aicill-type rhyme with the first stress of the second line (tràigh: nàr in lines 388-389). The first chorus also meets these requirements, but the second does not.


VIII. LATHA SLIABH AN T-SIORRAIM (3)

This poem is “strophic”, with four strophes to the stanza. The two main stresses of the first line of each strophe (couplet) rhyme with each other and with the first main stress of the second line; the final stresses of the four strophes rhyme throughout the stanza. The metre is similar to that of Poem no. II, the main difference being that here the “fourth rhyme”, occurring in the early Ochtfhoclach bec metre, is usually absent. It does occur in a few cases, e.g. lines 460-461:

Mun tig an Liùnastainn lagaidh chùis air,
Is théid a sgiùrsadh a nunn do ’n Spàinnt.

But its occurrence may be accidental. On the whole, the metrical “rules” seem to be observed more closely before st. 6 than after it.

[TD 234]

IX. DO DH’ARM RÌGH SHEUMAIS

[Ceòl]

As in the case of Poem no IV, the present poem has been composed on the model of an existing rhythmical pattern, set of refrain lines, and (almost certainly) tune. The refrain lines given here are those of I, with their slight variation from verse to verse: in T the refrain line changes only in the last line of the poem, but this is enough to suggest that variation in the refrain lines was intended by the poet.

Among other Gaelic poems using the same metrical form and similar refrain lines is Tha sinn fo mhulad ’s a’ coimhead a chéile by Rob Donn (1714–1778) printed in Guinne agus Mac-Phàrlain, Rob Donn, p. 71. In English there is Cold Frosty Morning (see below), as well as Jeanie’s Black Ee by Hector MacNeill (Poetical Works, Vol. II, p. 121); the latter is set to the tune of the former. I have also noted five sets of words to this pattern in Irish. But none of these poems is demonstrably older than the present poem, and I can make no suggestion as to the poem Sìleas used as a model.

[TD 235]

The tune given above is taken from that in S. Fraser’s Collection (1816), p. 22, no. 34, called: Tha mi mo chadal—I am asleep—Antient simple Set. This is highly complicated and ornate, and I have adopted the simplified version used by Mac Phàrlain to fit the words of Rob Donn’s poem mentioned above (Guinne agus Mac-Phàrlain, Rob Donn, p. 71); I have also restored Fraser’s key of F.

Mac Phàrlain believed the tune to be of Irish origin, but the Irish songs mentioned above do not, as far as I know, use this tune. John Glen, in his Early Scottish Melodies (Edinburgh, 1900, p. 135), lists the earliest publications of the tune: the first he notes is dated c. 1726, where it is called Cha mi ma chattle in the music for Allan Ramsay’s Tea-Table Miscellany (cf. Stenhouse, Illustrations, p. 217); and it appears again in a Scottish MS of c. 1740. Other Scottish published versions are as follows:

1752: Oswald, Caledonian Pocket Companion, Book IV, p. 16 (called Cold frostie morning);

1790: Johnson, Scots Musical Museum, Vol. III, p. 236, no. 227 (called Cauld frosty morning; with three stanzas of English words beginning: “’Twas past ane o’ clock in a cauld frosty morning”).

1816: Fraser’s Collection.

The tune was also known in Ireland, and Glen points out that it was published as an Irish tune under the title Past one o’clock in Burk Thumoth’s Twelve Scotch and twelve Irish Airs round about 1740. It appears also in three 19th-century Irish sources:

1. Bunting’s 1840 Collection, p. 74: “I am asleep, and don’t waken me”, noted by Bunting in 1792.

2. Ibid. p. 57: “Soft Mild Morning” (also called Maidin bhog áoibhin, Index, p. iv, and Maidin bheag aoibhinn, Introduction, p. 64), recorded in 1796.

3. Petrie’s Collection (ed. Stanford), no. 488: “I am asleep and don’t wake me”, no source stated.

Bunting’s source for both his versions is, according to pp. viii and x of his Index, Denis O Hampsey (or Hempson, 1695–1807), the blind harper from Magilligan, Co. Derry, who spent

[TD 236]

part of his career travelling in Scotland, where he is said to have played the harp before Prince Charles Edward at Edinburgh in 1745 (Fox, Annals of the Irish Harpers, p. 116). A version of this tune was also known to Arthur O Neill, another 18th-century harper (ibid. p. 157).

John Glen believed the tune to be of either Irish or Highland origin, but does not decide which, and it is probably impossible to do so. The indecisiveness of the evidence, and the remarkable correspondence of the titles, probably indicate that the tune was part of a common musical heritage whose main exponents were the travelling harpers, and which had not yet been cut in two in the first half of the 18th century.

Since the tune was published in Scotland as early as 1726, we can hardly doubt that it was the tune Sìleas had in mind when composing her poem.


X. DO GHILLEASBUIG A MAC

Eight-line stanzas with two stresses per line. In each couplet the second stress rhymes with the third, and the final stress (antepenultimate) rhymes throughout the stanza. Compare the metres of nos. I and XV.


XI. CUMHA BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

[Ceòl]

The tune is taken from D, p. 36 (no. 18), where it is arranged for voice with piano accompaniment, and set to the words of

[TD 237]

st. 5; my adaptation of it to those of st. 1 is conjectural. The tune was also copied from D by Mac Phàrlain in The Celtic Monthly, XVI, p. 100, and should be compared with no. 157 in S. Fraser’s Collection (1816), p. 74.

The repetition of the third line of each stanza to form a fourth is attested in I and D, but in H it seems to be intended that all three lines should be repeated: after the third line H gives a few words from the beginning of the first, e.g.:

… Anns na rug orm eadar dà Dhisathurna.
O, cha’n urrainn, etc.
(line 641).

Omitting the fourth line of each stanza, the metre is clearly of the general type called “strophic” by Watson, in a form best known from the works of Màiri Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh and Iain Lom (BG, pp. l-lii). Each stanza has three lines, the first two with two main stresses each, and the third with three; in each stanza, rhyme connects the second stresses of the three lines, and the final stress of the stanza rhymes throughout the poem. This final stress is antepenultimate, with an a- or ai-sound followed by an h-sound or hiatus (thighe uam in line 649 presumably conformed to this pronunciation in Sìleas’ speech, as it does in the Glengarry dialect, see Dieckhoff, s.v. taigh). Other poems of this type with trisyllabic final are to be found in Watson’s Mary Macleod, p. 72; Mackenzie’s Iain Lom, p. 190; BG, p. 239; and TGSI XXIII, p. 276. In the last named, and in D, p. 38, the last line of each stanza is repeated, as here.

The tune given above is the only one I have seen for this poem, but Angus Fraser may have had another version of it, or another tune. Among the notes in his Notes MS (pp. 36-41) the following appears:

Nº 27 Air

Is the air to Julia or Cicely McDonnell’s lament for her husband, Gordon of Wardhus & Beldornie in Banff Shire, who died suddenly at Inverness sometime after the rebellion of 1715,—and for her child who died within a Week of its father. This lady who was a daughter of Keppoch composed many deservedly popular songs.—The only notice we have of Lachlan McKinnon the blind harper of Skye is

[TD 238]

through an excellent lament she made on receiving the news of his death. From this lament we learn that he used to visit at her fathers house at Keppoch when she was a child, and had continued his visits to herself till his death, which event caused her great grief. This song is of importance as it describes the habits of the Class to which he belonged, he was loved & respected, and appears to have been the confidential Messenger of the first families in the highlands, before the introduction of posts & public Messengers.

Nº 5 in the Appendix is the imitation of this rhythm.—Julia McDonnell’s verses are the only ones Known to Nº 27 Air which would have been lost had they not been printed by some zealot in highland Minstrelsy.


The final reference in this note may be to D, which contains versions, with tunes, of the present poem and of no. XIII. The account of Lachlan Mackinnon is in reference to Poem no. XXI.

To judge from this note, the verses by Sìleas to which No. 27 Air is fitted could be either those of the present poem or those of no. XIII. Fraser’s Notes refer to his “Music of Caledonia” MS, but in this No. 27 is missing. In his “Vocal Airs” MS he repeats many of the tunes in the “Music of Caledonia” MS, but there is no means of identifying with certainty the tune referred to in the Notes, if it is there. However, the “Vocal Airs” MS contains as no. 68 a tune, with bass part added, under the title Tha mo chridh’ air fàs tròm. Lament by Julia Macdonald, and it is possible that this is the tune to which the note refers. The title, however, is the opening line of a lament for his wife by George MacKenzie of Gruineard (fl. c. 1700), occurring in ML MS 169 and printed in G, p. 55; IC, p. 73; Maclean Sinclair, Mactalla nan Tur, p. 45. Fraser’s tune fits the words of MacKenzie’s poem, in which the final stress of the third line of each stanza is monosyllabic, and does not fit the present poem where the final stress is trisyllabic. Fraser has therefore made a mistake in ascribing MacKenzie’s poem to Sìleas. On MacKenzie see also Poem no. XV, Notes.


XII. LAOIDH AIR BÀS A FIR AGUS A H-IGHNE

The metre is that described in BG, p. lvii, as a type of Cumha. As Watson there points out, “this is really a quatrain, con-

[TD 239]

sisting of four long lines, each with five stresses”. In fact, the only significant difference between this metre and the amhran type with five stresses per line (BG, p. lv) is that in the present poem and its like the second and fourth stresses of the long line fall on the same vowel-sound (giving an aicill effect if the poem is written in eight-line stanzas); whereas in the five-stress amhran of BG the second and third stresses fall on the same vowel-sound. Final rhyme connects lines 2, 4, 6 and 8 of each stanza (or all four of the long lines).

For a very similar poem see S, p. 396; this is a lament, perhaps by Fionnghal nighean Alasdair Ruaidh, for Iain Breac, 16th chief of the MacLeods of Dunvegan, who died in 1693 (Matheson, Blind Harper, p. lii, n. 1), and Sìleas probably used it as a model, to some extent, for the present poem.


XIII. MARBHRANN

[Ceòl]

If we except a number of lines in the opening stanzas, this poem fits best into the metrical type which Watson (BG, pp. lvii-lx) calls a four-stress Cumha. Each line has four stresses and the final (penultimate) stress rhymes throughout the stanza. In many cases the second stress of a line rhymes with the third, and there is fairly frequent alliteration.

The only source I have seen for the tune is D, p. 28, and I have copied it exactly as it appears there, fitted to the words of st. 1. This tune was also copied from D by Mac Phàrlain in The Celtic Monthly, XVI, p. 240.

Cf. Poem no. XI, Metres and Tunes.

[TD 240]

XIV. ALASDAIR A GLEANNA GARADH

[Ceòl]

This poem is syllabic, containing eight syllables per line with penultimate stress, and thus resembling the Middle Irish rannaigecht bec mór (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, p. 54). Lines 824-826, which have ultimate stress, are in a very unclear and probably corrupt passage. The metre differs from rannaigecht bec mór in that the aicill (rhyme between the final word of a line and a word in the interior of the next line) can occur in any couplet, and in that the poem is made up of eight-line stanzas; this is the form given in all the sources, and it is confirmed by the tune, and by the fact that in most cases all four couplets in the stanza are connected by the same final rhyme. The exceptions to this, however (stt. 1, 4, 9), might be considered enough to indicate that the poem had been composed in four-line stanzas.

The tune (which is hexatonic) is transcribed here by Mr Alasdair M. Grant from the singing of the Rev. William Matheson on School of Scottish Studies Tape SA1965/91; the text used by Mr Matheson is that of BG, p. 128, and I have here substituted the words of the present version. Another transcription of the tune, to different words, appears in Mr Matheson’s Songs of John Maccodrum, p. 339, and on p. 321 we find that Mr Matheson got the tune from Uist oral tradition. The song was sung with ordinary speech stress, so that

[TD 241]

any time-signature or barring would be unnecessary and irrelevant.

A more regularised version of the tune, set to the present poem, appeared in The Celtic Monthly, Vol. XI (1903), p. 80, submitted by Henry Whyte (“Fionn”), and was reprinted in An Deo-Greine, Vol. IV (1909), p. 132, and Orain a’ Mhoid, Vol. IV, p. 7; cf. J. L. Campbell, Highland Songs of the Forty-five, p. 304. Another regularised version appears in the Angus Fraser MS (“Caledonia” MS no. 94; “Vocal Airs” MS, p. 33, no. 65), and in his Notes (p. 68) Angus says of the tune: “We find the first or Themal form of it in Captn Frasers book of 1816 Nº 109 to an eulogy on King George III by Dn McIntyre”. Mr John MacInnes informs me that there are many wide variants of this tune, which has been a popular mould for Gaelic poetry from the 18th century till the present day; it seems also to be the only extant tune which will fit poems of this metre (cf. Poem no. XXI, Metres and Tunes). The tune is usually called Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh, this poem being apparently the oldest known poem set to it. But Angus Fraser says (Notes, p. 68): “other bards both before and after her (Sìleas’) day used the air exclusively in heroic or battle songs”. The Rev. W. Matheson has suggested to me that it may, in fact, not be the original tune for the present poem, if the poem was originally written in 4-line stanzas, as suggested above.

Nos. XIX, XX and XXI here are of the same basic metrical construction, and No. XIX at least is sung to variants of the same tune. Other songs using the same tune and metre include the following: two by Donnchadh Bàn (Macleod edn., pp. 2, 26); three other poems in T, p. 38 (= BG, p. 25), p. 261 and p. 337; a poem in Macpherson’s Duanaire, p. 200; Moladh Chlann Domhnaill by John MacCodrum (1693–1779), though the tune for this is named in SO, p. 155, as Oran a ghunna da’ b’ ainm an spàinteach (Matheson, MacCodrum, pp. 124, 340). Two further songs to this tune seem to have followed Sìleas’ words very closely as a pattern in places: E, p. 318, and G, p. 66 (= An Gaidheal, Vol. IV, 1875, p. 39).

[TD 242]

XV. AN AGHAIDH NA H-OBAIR NODHA

[Ceòl]

Metrically this poem is rather similar to Am Breacan Uallach by Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (BG, p. 111); as Watson suggests (BG, p. lxii) it might be better to consider each couplet as a single long line. Then for each stanza we have four long lines, each with four main stresses, the second and third of which rhyme with each other (bhodhradh and tòghnadh in the first couplet, daoine and laoidh in the second). The fourth stress would be expected to fall on the words forming final rhyme throughout the stanza (Nodha, gnothach, gnothaist, mnathaibh, in the first stanza) as is suggested by Watson. But in my opinion the rhythm and the music as given above (and below) do not admit of this analysis, and the fourth stress occurs earlier in the line (at Obair, nì iad, bithinn and air in st. 1). We thus have the rather unusual situation where the final rhyming words fall on what is at most a strong secondary stress (cf. also Nos. I, II and XXIII, Metres and Tunes).

The tune above is adapted to fit the words of st. 1 from the singing of st. 2 by Donald Sinclair (Dòmhnall Chaluim Bàin), Baile a’ Phuill, Tiree; this was recorded in 1970 by John MacInnes for the School of Scottish Studies, and is the more recent of two performances of st. 2 by Mr Sinclair recorded by Mr MacInnes (cf. Sources and Readings). The earlier performance, recorded in 1969, is as follows, with the words sung on the tape (both transcriptions are my own, and are therefore not to be relied on very heavily):

[TD 243]

[Ceòl]

Mrs A. Munro of the School of Scottish Studies informs me that these two different versions probably contain what is basically the same tune. Both versions as sung contain a clear change of key at the end, a rather unusual occurrence in Gaelic tunes. It may be that, due to the great age and infirmity of the singer, both tunes have been altered from the form in which he heard them. If so, I have no means of restoring the original tune; though it seems to me that the opening of the earlier version, given above, must be wrong, since the note D occurring there occurs nowhere else in the tune—the words “Gad bhithinn-s’ ann am ghruagaich” might be better sung to the notes used for “Mur faighinn fear pòsda”.

In Angus Fraser’s “Vocal Airs” manuscript, the following tune appears as no. 50, with a bass part added, under the title: An obair nodha.—The Work in prospect:

[Ceòl]

[TD 244]

This tune is marked “Slow Strathspey Style” in the manuscript, and this may mean that Angus’ source gave him the tune as a dance-tune rather than as the tune of a song. It will be seen that only half of this tune would be used by a stanza of the present poem, and unless two stanzas are to be sung to the tune, we must conclude that, in the form in which we have it, it is not properly the tune of Sìleas’ poem. In fact, the title makes it more likely to be the tune of the original poem to which Sìleas’ poem is an answer (see Appendix III), and this poem has an eight-line luinneag to which the second (or the first) part of the tune could be sung.


XVI. LAOIDH NA MAIDNE

This poem appears to be constructed broadly on the pattern of syllabic rannaigecht, as used in Poem no. XVII: 4 lines per stanza, rhyme between the second and fourth lines of the stanza, and aicill in most couplets. But there is no obvious regard for the syllabic count of the lines.


XVII. LAOIDH AN T-SOLUIS

This poem is syllabic, of the rannaigecht type (Murphy, Early Irish Metrics, pp. 46 ff.). In each four-line stanza lines b and d rhyme, and aicill usually connects the finals of lines a and c with words in the interior of lines b and d respectively. Except in st. 5, the word forming aicill in line d is the second last stressed word, but this may be accidental. The number of syllables per line varies from seven (monosyllabic ending) to 8 (usually disyllabic ending). There is occasional alliteration.


XVIII. LAOIDH NA H-OIDHCHE

The metre is basically the same as that of no. XVII.

[TD 245]

XIX. LAOIDH MHOIRE MHAIGHDEAN

[Ceòl]

The metre of this poem is the same as that of nos. XIV, XX and XXI, syllabic, with eight syllables per line, except that here the poem is divided into four-line stanzas. This is the form in which it appears in ML, I and CW (though I numbers the quatrains in pairs), while other sources give eight-line stanzas (IA has no stanza division).

The tune, taken from SA1951/8, sung by Fanny MacIsaac of Benbecula, is a version of Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh, the tune of Poem no. XIV, used also for the present poem in SA1962/4; cf. Innes Review, Vol. 7, p. 108, n. 5.

It will be seen that the tune embraces two of the four-line stanzas. But as each quatrain of the text is complete in itself as regards sense, and as the final rhyme is sustained usually only for four lines instead of eight, it seems likely that the poem was originally written in four-line stanzas, and therefore probably not to the eight-line tune of Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh (cf. the remarks on Poem no. XIV, Metres and Tunes). However, I have not found any other tune for the present poem (cf. Poem no. XXI, Metres and Tunes).

If the above tune is not that to which the poem was composed, it was nevertheless probably associated with the poem at least as early as 1800, thus causing the evident indecision on the part of Irvine where he writes four-line stanzas but numbers them in pairs.

[TD 246]

XX. AN EAGLAIS

The poem seems to be broadly based on the metrical construction of syllabic poetry of the rannaigecht type as used in Nos. XIV, XIX and XXI; there are eight lines per stanza (as given in both sources), but only in stt. 8 and 9 does final rhyme connect the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th lines. In other stanzas the 2nd and 4th lines rhyme on a different syllable from that used in the 6th and 8th (cf. Nos. XIV and XIX, Metres and Tunes). The finals of the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th lines of each stanza usually form aicill with words in the interior of the following line. But the rules for the syllabic count of lines are not very meticulously observed.


XXI. CUMHA LACHLAINN DAILL

This poem is in the same syllabic metre as nos. XIV, XIX and XX. Though the eight-line stanzas appear in both sources, and are almost certainly guaranteed by the tune (see below), the system of final rhymes, except possibly in st. 8, indicates that the poem may have been composed in four-line stanzas, as is possible also for the other poems mentioned above.

The tune for the poem is said in S, p. 337, to be “Chaidh mi tur a dheanadh aodaich”; this is the opening line of Laoidh an Tàilleir, a parody of Ossianic poetry composed during Sìleas’ lifetime (printed in Rel. Celt. I, p. 342; BG, p. 115); it is in the same metre as the present poem. The Rev. William Matheson and Mr John MacInnes both assure me that they know of no tune to fit poems in this metre except versions of Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh (cf. Nos. XIV and XIX); I have found no tune fitted to the words of Laoidh an Tàilleir. It may thus be that the tune intended by the Stewarts was a version of the Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh tune; if another tune was intended it is no longer extant. In any case, this poem may be sung to either of the variants of Alasdair a Gleanna Garadh given here (no. XIV or no. XIX).


XXII. [CEÒL NA CLÀRSAICH]

The poem is composed on a loose syllabic pattern. Basically stt. 1, 2 and 4 have seven syllables per line with final monosyllable, while st. 3 has eight syllables per line with final disyl-

[TD 247]

lable. Final rhyme connects lines b and d in each stanza, and aicill may occur in either couplet of the stanza.

In the manuscript (I) the poem appears as two eight-line stanzas. Each of these is here divided in two, partly because each group of four lines is complete in itself as regards both sense and rhyme, and partly because what is here st. 3 is metrically different from st. 4. Irvine may have written the poem in eight-line stanzas merely because the related and immediately preceding Poem no. XXI was so written.


XXIII. AM BÀS IS FLATHANAS

I have found no tune for this poem. Metrically, it seems best to consider it as an ordinary stress poem, with two stresses per line and rhyme between lines b and d. Aicill appears fairly consistently, and in some cases (like the second couplets of stt. 6-9) the second rhyming word in the aicill (fhuair, chlàr, chathair, bhàs) is unstressed; compare the apparent rhyming of an unstressed syllable in Poems I and II.

This poem is taken from CW, p. 116, and from Fr Allan MacDonald’s Notebook VI (written in March or April 1898, and now among the Henderson MSS), Item 292. Fr Allan made both these copies from the lost MS of Iain Bàn.

In Notebook VI (referred to below as He), for which my information was kindly supplied by Dr J. L. Campbell, the poem is preceded by a note by Fr Allan:

The follg. verses also from the MS of John Bàn Keppoch? The author of this piece seems to have been in a trance for some time. I have frequently heard that “Sileas Nigh ic Raonaill” a poetess of the Keppoch family who lived in Lovat’s country was in a trance for a long time. Possibly she is the author of most in the MS. I do not know if she

[TD 250]

lived as late as the ’45. A book of hymns by her was published in Inverness about 1820 but I never saw it. Possibly I am writing down what is only already printed.


Then follows the text, after which Fr Allan says: “I may transcribe some other pieces later from the same MS”.

The theme of the poem, then, as well as the fact that the other four poems copied in CW from the Iain Bàn MS (nos. III, XVII, XVIII, XX) are all ascribed to Sìleas, suggests that this poem too may be by her.

The title given here is that appearing on the second page of the Clar-Innse in CW. There is no title in He.

See Introduction, Section 5. Copied from the singing of the late Mr Neil Mackinnon (Niall Theàrlaich Ruaidh), Torrin, Strath, Skye, on School of Scottish Studies tape SA1953/165; the final verse, however, is added on the tape by an unidentified woman’s voice. Mr Mackinnon had two traditions concerning the authorship of the song: one which he heard from Alasdair MacInnes, Torrin, that it was composed by Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig; and the other, which he heard from Peigidh Ruairidh, Mrs Anderson (née Munro, a native of Breakish), Torrin, that it was composed by Sìleas na Ceapaich to Lachlann Mac Theàrlaich Òig. The latter is the tradition mentioned by John MacInnes in SGS XI, p. 14; Mr MacInnes informs me that his own grand-uncle, Neil MacInnes (1863–1951), Drumfearn, Sleat, also believed the song to be the work of Sìleas.

The verses are very similar to some of those in the version given in E, p. 351, but the second stanza above, identifying the subject as a Mackinnon, is absent in E; this stanza is probably the crucial element in a comparatively recent re-working of some version of Dh’fhalbh mo rùn-sa air an aiseag similar to that in E. The Rev. W. Matheson has suggested to me that, to judge from stanza XVII there, the poem in E was addressed to a Stewart. There are at least two other versions of the poem (without any evident Mackinnon connections) in the collection of the School of Scottish Studies, and another may be seen in TGSI, XXXIX/XL, p. 189 (cf. Calum I. Maclean, The Highlands, p. 54).

APPENDIX V

Memorandum as to Invercauld and Camdels intrest in Stradown 1712.

When Invercauld dispensed with the intrest of Glengairn to be Given by the Duk of Gordon to the Earle of Aboyne for making up the portion allowed him of the estate of huntly by K Charles anno 1660 he gott in wadset the Six hundred and twentie merks then of free rent in Strathdown and the four score merks of annuitie lyable out of the braes [of Avon] Redeemable for eleven thousand merks with power to keep courts free of the countrie bailzie as he had in Glengairn and uther conditions specified in the contract.

The tennandrie finding themselves at ane ease thereby did undergoe for customs such as fowlls lambs butter etc to the value of fifty or sixtie merks when converted And the Kepach being then at a 100¹ rent gott from him of Diminution twentie merks which was exacted on the daach of Fotterletter. But they finding it troublesome everie on cary the forsd customes to Invercauld did undergo monie therfor.

Alexr Gordon of Camdell having wadset the above intrest from Invercauld’s son at Whitsunday 1694 holden of him by the Duke of Gordon’s consent and allowance never Imposed any duty thereon But lost spent and payed by Mcyeanduy a tennant in Kepach proven to be at Glenkindies Spulzie ten thousand pound Scots. And lykvayes by the bad yiers (known to all Stradoun) most of it for several yeirs vaist That ther was little above 200 merks rent tennantstyle some of the rest sett for Kirk and King and other some eatn by the country or himself shealling thereon, he paying Kirk and King therfor and not all to the Rentall as yet

As for the augmentation Imposed on Wm Gordon of Crouchly It was the effect of his neighbours craving to be alse cheap as he; his land being alse good as theirs; which being so found by the birliemen of the country spring 1704 made it desired be alike in dutie with them, And so offered himself last yeir as ane

[TD 260]

uther was readie and did take it in the same terms and Judged micht be frielie don since Camdel only placed him at Donald Robertsons death in the bad yiers, And that by the conquess ther mad (the adjacent land being vaist) he had wodset ane uther portion By which his discretion etc apears. It was visible in the yeir 1699 when Camdel left Ruthven haveing no bodie theron but himself and the Maynes of beldornie also vaist he had near 500 merk rent vaist and Camdel in a manner alse vaist being only posest by ane Athole Gentleman who removed att Whitsunday 1701 and left 400 merk without a Riek theron but on lyable in ten pound Scots of dutie

And so it is palpable there is no wodset of haill or half value of the Estate of huntly, with so little advantage when wholly sett or so subject to wastation by troubles or bad yiers as experience shows. It may be considered if for the person or advantage alledged proferred Invercauld (whoes father not only dispensed with Glengairn but advysed James and David farqrsones dispense with whythouse in the braes of Cromar for and at Setling the Duke of Gordon and Earle of Aboyne anno 1702 or 1703) is to be dispensed with as vassall, without noticeing Camdels concern, altho since the yeir 1680 he ever served when employed as factor in the Lo/ps of Lochaber, badenoch, Kinraira, Castle lands of Inverness, Stradown, Glenlivat etc tymes of peace war and famin and also Liewally proceded now and then father, goodsr, grandsr and f = grandsr to witt Mr George Gordon of Beldornie who first setled Badenoch and Lochaber in ane definit rentall.

And if resolved to be done It wer resonable also Redeem Camdell from Alexr Gordon since folly and dependance on his superior chiefs Kyndnes mad him not only build the bridge of Avin but also ther, Accomodation on the Urlarmor Capable only to be accomodat in Faill divot grass etc from the uther side of the water but still better for the portion as formerly James Gordon of Tilesoull his father haveing at the Duk of Gordon’s desire, advanced the money to relieve the same from donald Grant of Gaick wodsetter therof from Inverey and oblidged to Assigne and dispone the sam to his Grace and then got ane wodset therof to himself from D Gordon.
