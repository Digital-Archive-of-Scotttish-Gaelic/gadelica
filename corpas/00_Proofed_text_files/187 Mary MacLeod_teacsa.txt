Notes on the Sources

The footnotes on the text do not give all the variations of the printed and MS. sources; the omission by any source of a line or stanza is not noted save in one or two cases; nor are the orthographical minutiæ of the MS. versions recorded, as this would serve no useful purpose. The simple priniciple has been followed of noting variants only when they seem to furnish a clue to the genuine text; and in the formation of the text the few departures made on MS. evidence from printed versions, when they do not depend on matters of fact, as in ll. 840 and 819, depend on the principle that, other things being equal, the more unusual word is the less likely to be corrupt.

E. and S. are generally preferable to SO., since the latter is to a large extent a work of transcription and has a tendency to regularize any unusual feature. In one poem T. has been preferred to GB., the version of MC. being printed in full in the notes with amended spelling. In four poems the text of BGh. has been followed with two or three trivial variations.

The fusion of different versions has been avoided.

“Fìon ’ga ligeadh,					75
Beoir ’ga h-òl ac’,

Is treas-tarruing

Mairearad nan Cuireid

Oran a rinn Màiri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh, is
Mairearad nan cuireid a’ togail oirre gun robh i
leatromach.

Ach, a Mhairearad nan cuireid,
Cuime a chuir thu orm breug:
Hi riri o hiri o hi o.

Gun robh leanabh gun bhaisteadh
Fo aisne mo chléibh’,

Ann an làraich mhic tighearn’				125
Far nach bithinn ’s tu fhéin.

Cuim’ nach innseadh tu an fhìrinn
Cho cinnteach rium fhéin?

Cha b’ionann do m’athair
Is do t’athair-sa, éisg!					130

Cha b’ionann do m’ bhràithrean
Is do d’ ghàrlaich gun spéis.

Cha b’ionann do ar tighean
An ám laighe do ’n ghréin:

Gum faighte an tigh m’athar-s’			135
Sitheann ’s cnàimhean an fhéidh:	

Is e gheibhte an tigh t-athar-s’
Sùgh is cnàimhean an éisg.

An ám dìreadh o’n bhaile
Is trom ’s gur h-annamh mo cheum.			140

Gur a diombach mi ’n chaile
Thog sgannal nam breug;

Dubh iomall na tuatha,
Buinneag shuarach gun spréidh,

Thog ormsa an droch alladh,
Is ortsa, a Chaluim nam beus,

Air an d’fhàs an cùl dualach
Tha ’na chuaileanan réidh,				150

Is e sìos mu d’ dhà shlinnean
Mar an fhidheall fo theud.


Marbhrann

do Fhear na Comraich

Tha mise air leaghadh le bròn
O’n là dh’eug thu ’s nach beò
Mu m’fhiùran faidhidneach còir			155
Uasal aighearach òg
As uaisle shuidheadh mu bhòrd:
Mo chreach t’fhaighinn gun treoir éirigh.

Is tu an laoch gun laigse gun leòn
Macan mìngheal gun sgleò;				160
Fearail fìnealta an t-òg
De shliochd nam fear mór
D’am bu dual a bhith còir,
’S gum b’fhiù faiteal do bheoil éisdeachd.

Is tu clann na h-irghinn a b’fheàrr,			165
Glan an fhriamh as an d’fhàs,
Càirdeas rìgh anns gach ball,
Bha sud sgrìobht’ leat am bann
Fo làimh duine gun mheang
Ach thu lìonta de àrdan euchdach.			170

A Ruairidh aigeanntaich àird
O Chomraich ghreadhnaich an àigh,
Mhic an fhir bu mhór gàir
Nan lann guineach cruaidh garg,
Ort cha d’fhuaradh riamh cearb,			175
Iarogha Uilleam nan long bréidgheal.

Fhuair mi m’àilleagan ùr
Is e gun smal air gun smùr,
Bu bhreac mìndearg do ghnùis,
Bu ghorm laghach do shùil,				180
Bu ghlan sliasaid is glùn,
Bu deas daingeann an lùb ghleusta thu.

A lùb abhall nam buadh,
Is mairg a tharladh ort uair
Mu Ghlaic Fhionnlaigh so shuas			185
Air each crodhanta luath,
Nàmhaid romhad ’na ruaig,
Air dhòigh buille cha b’uair éis e.

Ach fhir as curanta làmh
Thug gach duine gu cràdh,				190
Is truagh nach d’fhuirich thu slàn
Ri uair cumaisg no blàir
Thoirt tilleadh as do nàmh;
Bu leat urram an là cheutaich.

Bu tù an sgoilear gun dìobradh,			195
Meoir as grinne nì sgrìobhadh,
Uasal faidhidneach cinnteach,
Bu leat lagh an tigh-sgrìobhaidh,
Is tu nach mùchadh an fhìrinn;
Sgeul mo chreiche so! shil do chreuchdan.		200

Dhiùlt an gobha dhomh gleus;
Dh’fhairtlich sud orm ’s gach léigh,			205
Is chaidh m’onoir, is, mo rìgh, dh’eug thu.

Thuit a’chraobh as a bàrr,

<eng>This lament for Iain Garbh of Raasay is in Còisir a’ Mhòid (I. 50) ascribed to Mary MacLeod, on what authority is not stated. Raasay tradition, as I am told by Mr. Alexander Nicolson and others, unhesitatingly ascribes it to Iain Garbh’s sister, and this fact, along with the style of the song itself, makes it, I think, certain that Mary was not the author. Mr. Nicolson has collected in Raasay a less complete version. The free rendering is in the metre of the original.<gai>

POSADH MHIC LEOID

This so-called “Conversation between Mary MacLeod and Nic Dhomhnaill” presents some puzzling problems. First, a section of it closely resembles part of the “Tàladh Dhomhnaill Ghuirm le a Mhuime” contributed to the Gael (V. 68) by Dr. Alexander Carmichael and printed in BGh. with some improvements from Dr. Carmichael’s later and much fuller version. The two poems should be compared, and contrasted, in their entirety, but especially with ll. 13 ff. of the text cf. BGh. 6516 ff.:

<gai>
Nàile nàile hò		nàile gu triall
Moch a màireach	gun d’fhaighnich a’ bhean
De’n mhnaoi eile:	na, có i an long ud
Siar an eirthir		’s a’ chuan Chananach?
Don-bìdh ort!		c’uim an ceilinn?
Có ach long Dhomhnaill	long mo leinibh
Long mo rìgh-sa	long nan Eilean.
Is mór leam an trom	atà ’san eathar.
Tha stiuir òir oirr’	trì chroinn sheilich.
Gu bheil tobar fìona	shìos ’na deireadh
Is tobar fìoruisg’	’s a’ cheann eile;
<eng>

[TD 110]

and with ll. 75 ff. cf. BGh. 6542:

<gai>
Ol fìona	is beoir ad champa.
<eng>

What may be the relation between the two will be considered later.

Next we have the difficulty of the second line (Nic an Tòisich) and the heading (Nic Dhomhnaill á Trondairnis); how can the same woman bear both designations? It seems probable, indeed almost certain, that the lady meant is Marjory (Mairearad of l. 1), daughter of Macintosh of that ilk, who married Domhnall Gorm of Sleat in or immediately before 1614; if then ll. 3 and 4 are to be taken literally, the first section of the poem was composed in or before 1615 and not by Mary MacLeod. This section seems to end at l. 10.

We then come to a section which shows the closest correspondence with the Tàladh, but which is in praise not of Donald Gorm but of a Ruairidh òg Mac Leoid, who is said, apparently, to have equalled Mackenzie and surpassed MacDonald. In view of that correspondence we can say quite definitely that Mary was not the author, in the proper sense, of this section. As we have no clue to the date, we cannot say which Roderick MacLeod is meant, or whether he was a contemporary of Mary MacLeod. If she had any hand in the composition as it stands, she was adapting to her own use the lines we find in the Tàladh. It is very likely, as the Rev. Malcolm Maclean points out to me, that the Conaltradh, the Tàladh and many other poems have embedded in them much older fragments, which are akin in spirit to the old tales; these fragments formed the stock in trade of the poets, which they did not hesitate to use, and among them are the lines common to the Conaltradh and the Tàladh. This section ends at l. 60.

The rest of the poem is in baser style; it is inferior in language and versification, its spirit is that of a tàmailt or an aoir, and its taste is doubtful—altogether a declension from the heroic fervour of the central part of the poem. Its style is by no means that of Mary MacLeod, and it was clearly composed at a time when MacDonald and MacLeod were at bitter enmity, which was the case during Sir Roderick Mór’s time (d. 1626) but not during Mary’s poetic career.

1. Mairearad: Marjory, daughter of the chief of Macintosh, was the third wife of Domhnall Gorm Mór VII of Sleat; in

[TD 111]

1614, no doubt on his marriage or soon after, he made provision for her by granting her a charter of lands in Sleat. It is unusual but not impossible that the wife of MacDonald should be styled Nic Dhomhnaill; we should rather have expected Bean Mhic Dhomhnaill. Again, the usual Gaelic equivalent for Marjory is Marsaili; but Marjory, Margery, and Margaret are the same name. There seems little doubt of the identification. This Donald Gorm is the same whose name is associated with the Tàladh.

23 ff. Shìn i taobh, &c.: “She drew alongside Mackenzie’s boat,” i.e. she was the equal of the other in sailing, and MacLeod was the equal of Mackenzie, no small boast in the days when Mackenzie’s power was paramount over all the northwest—“có bheireadh geall ri Mac Coinnich?” Such seems to be the secondary meaning, though Mary may be speaking of friendship and alliance.

Chuir i bòrd, &c.: We may take bòrd to mean a tack in sailing, though it appears not to be used in this sense in Scotland now; “she outsailed the island boat by a tack, outstripped her by the distance covered in a tack.” Or we may take bòrd in its ordinary meaning of a plank: “she knocked a plank out of the island boat,” perhaps by some such feat as “bumping”. In any case the meaning is that she outsailed or surpassed the island boat. What then is long an Eilein? An t-Eilean is Skye, and in view of this and of long Dhomhnaill … long nan eilean in the Tàladh it seems certain that the island boat symbolizes MacDonald of Sleat. MacLeod then surpassed MacDonald, and was equalled only by Mackenzie—the same championship of MacLeod against MacDonald as we find in the last section of the poem.

33. Ruairidh: who this Ruairidh chief of MacLeod was is uncertain.

48. an Dùn: Dunvegan.

58. Fionn: the leader of the Fiann, of whom Diarmaid Ua Duibhne was one, flourished in the third century A.D. His son was Ossian, and Ossian’s son was Oscar. Goll mac Morna was the chief warrior of the Clann Morna, and a frequent opponent of Fionn. Cuchulainn (fl. c. A.D. 1), the Fiann, Ossian and Oscar are mentioned in the Tàladh Dhomhnaill Ghuirm.

62. Caolas rònach: if this is a place-name it is a curious

[TD 112]

one, and I have not been able to find it; more likely “a seal-haunted strait”.

80. Supply do before the verbal noun riarachadh: “a useful help towards completing one’s sense of satisfaction at a meal.”

83. Trondairnis: i.e. from Dùn-tuilm, the principal residence of MacDonald at this time.

100. Domhnall: almost certainly Donald Gorm Mór who died in 1616 or 1617. The Sir Donald who died in 1643 was summoned to appear before the Covenanting Parliament in Edinburgh in 1641, to answer for rendering assistance to Charles I; while Sir Donald the tenth chief continued his resistance to King William’s government even after Killiecrankie, and only submitted after his castle of Sleat had been bombarded by two government ships of war. It does not appear, however, that either of these was actually imprisoned; and the reference in ll. 103, 104, is no doubt to the imprisonment of Donald Gorm Mór by the King and Privy Council of Scotland in 1589 and 1608.

108. Gleann Shealtainn, anglicized Glen Haultin, in Trotternish, east of Snizort.


MAIREARAD NAN CUIREID
A specimen of the Tàmailt.


MARBHRANN DO FHEAR NA COMRAICH

This is the earliest poem of certain date ascribed to Mary. Its subject is Roderick Mackenzie of Applecross, who died on 6th July, 1646. His father, Alexander Mackenzie of Coul and Applecross, was an illegitimate son of Colin Cam of Kintail, and brother of Kenneth first Lord Mackenzie of Kintail and Sir Roderick of Cóigeach, the Tutor of Kintail. Roderick died before his father (ll. 236 a and b), and never succeeded to the estate of Coul, but received Applecross as his patrimony during his father’s lifetime.

165. Clann na h-irghinn: Roderick’s mother was Annabella, daughter of Murdoch Mackenzie I. of Fairburn, who was the illegitimate son of Roderick Mór Mackenzie I. of Achilty and a daughter of William Dubh MacLeod of Harris and Dunvegan.

[TD 113]

172 A’ Chomraich, “the sanctuary” of St. Maelrubha (A.D. 642–722) who founded the monastery of Applecross in A.D. 673. The sanctuary had a radius of six miles, and appears to have been marked by stone crosses (CPNS.). The Gaelic for “in Applecross” is still “air a’ Chomraich”.

173. gàir is the accus. of respect, limiting the sphere in which adj. is to be understood; “great in respect of shout;” the other exx. of this acc. are in ll. 274, 318, 339, 441, 447, 533, 535, 572, 626, 636, 795, 910, 928, 940, 1212.

176. Strictly, great-great-grandfather.

185. Glaic Fhionnlaigh is beside the shore between Milton and Camusterrach, on the other side of the road from Milton loch at a distance of 30 or 40 yards. An old wall running from the loch to the glaic is called gàradh Fhionnlaigh. There is no local tradition of a battle, but a piece of level ground 150 or 200 yards away is called Blàr Dubh.

203. I owe the reading in the text to Dr. D. J. Macleod: “I laid by my harp in a coffer” makes excellent sense, especially in view of the following line. Taking ciste nan teud of all the sources, ciste is coffin, and the teudan are the ropes by which it is lowered. The other seems distinctly better.

204. an gobha: “the smith,” (who possibly nailed up the coffin), “denied me gleus,” i.e. the mood appropriate to music; the sense is obscure.

216. nighean Iarla Chlann Domhnaill: the reference, if we are to take it literally, is obscure; but the expression is probably a figurative one. Roderick’s wife was Fionnghal, daughter of Murdoch Mackenzie of Redcastle.

224. t’fhàgail: note subjective use of the pronoun, “thy leaving (of me)”; contrast “Is neo-roghainn leam t’fhàgail,” “I am reluctant to leave thee.”

228. ? as a sign of grief.

236c. Roderick had no full brothers; he had, however, three half brothers, sons of his father’s second marriage. These lines, though clearly corrupt, seem to be genuine.


AN TALLA AM BU GHNATH

This famous song, which in E. is headed Le Nighein Alastair ruaidh do Shir Toramaid Mac Leoid, was composed, says

[TD 114]

John Mackenzie, “on the Laird being sick and dying. He playfully asked Mary what kind of a lament she would make for him. Flattered by such a question, she replied that it would certainly be a very mournful one. ‘Come nearer me,’ said the aged and infirm chief, ‘and let me hear part of it.’ Mary, it is said, readily complied, and sung, ex tempore, that celebrated poem.”

We have no reason to disbelieve the substantial truth of this tradition; yet it seems probable from the whole tone of the poem that it was composed on the occasion of a minor illness rather than when Sir Norman was actually on his deathbed. Again, it seems likely that there was some considerable interval between its composition and Sir Norman’s death; for the only obvious reason for the survival of a tradition that the elegy was composed before his death would be that the poem became fairly widely known while its subject was known to be alive and well.

239. Mac Leoid: it seems almost certain that here for once Mary improperly applies this style to an other than the chief; yet the reference may be to the castle of Dunvegan and not to Sir Norman’s own house in Bernera.

263. bàrr is probably the duine-uasal’s crest of one eagle’s feather, but may refer to the feathered or bushy (dosrach) arrow-butts protruding from the mouth of the quiver.

267. Cf. Eachann Bacach do Shir Lachlann Triath Dhubhaird: Cha bhiodh òirleach gun bhàthadh Eadar smeoirn agus gàinne.

283. An Fhiann: see note on l. 58.

286. Note how the line merges into the following one.


MARBHRANN DO IAIN GARBH

Mr. James Fraser, in his Polichronicon under the year 1671, writes as follows (I owe this reference to Mr. A. Nicolson):

“This April the Earle of Seaforth duelling in the Lewes, a dreedful accident happened. His lady being brought to bed there, the Earle sent for John Garve M‘kleud, Laird of Rarzay, to witness the christning; and, after the treat and solemnity of the feast, Rarsay takes leave to goe home, and, after a rant of drinking uppon the shoare, went aboord off his birling and sailed away with a strong north gale off wind; and whither

[TD 115]

by giveing too much saile and no ballast, or the unskillfulness off the seamen, or that they could not mannage the strong Dut(ch) canvas saile, the boat whelmd, and all the men dround in view of the cost. The Laird and 16 of his kinsmen, the prime, perished; non of them ever found; a grewhound or two cast ashoare dead; and pieces of the birling. One Alexander Mackleod in Lewes the night before had voice warning him thrice not to goe at (all) with Rarsey, for all would drown in there return; yet he went with him, being infatuat, and drownd (with) the rest. This account I had from Alexander his brother the summer after. Drunkness did the (mischeife).”

We may take it, therefore, that Iain Garbh died at Easter (l. 354), 1671; and as he was served heir to his father in 1648, the tradition that he died at the age of twenty-one must be discarded. From l. 352 it is clear that he was succeeded by his brother; in Origines Parochiales (II, i, 348) it is stated that “in 1688 Janet and Giles MacLeods, alias MacAlasdair mhic Ghille Chaluim (sisters of Iain Garbh) were served heirs of line, conquest, and provision to their father Alexander Macleod”; and we may suppose that it was on the death of this brother that the representation of the family devolved upon Alexander, son of John, brother of Iain Garbh’s father.

Iain’s size and strength are still a tradition in Skye, and especially in Raasay; among several songs composed upon him are two elegies by his sister, one of which (Och nan och ’s mi fo léireadh) is in Còisir a’ Mhòid ascribed to Mary MacLeod; (1) the other, a magnificent lament, begins:

<gai>
Mi am shuidh air an fhaoidhlinn
Is mi gun fhaoilte gun fhuran,
Cha tog mi fonn aotrom
O Dhi-haoine mo dhunaidh,
<eng>

with which cf. l. 354. Pàdraig Mór’s pìobaireachd, Cumha Iain Ghairbh, is well known. The tradition that witchcraft brought about his drowning is related in Clàrsach na Coille, p. 290, and in J. Gregorson Campbell’s Witchcraft and Second-sight in the Highlands, p. 25.

297. “a hand unerring and unblemished, undamaged.”


(1) I accept as conclusive the Raasay tradition which, I am told, ascribes the song to Iain Garbh’s sister and not to Mary MacLeod; see p. 100.

[TD 116]

The sense is like that of “gun leòn làimhe gun laige,” (Eachann Bacach, do Shir Lachlann Triath Dhubhaird).

315. oirre refers to the boat; “a hand that would not cease from causing her to speed.”

321. a ghabhail orra: “to reach them.”

329. do bhaile gun smùid, &c.: we might be tempted to take this as referring to Iain Garbh’s house in Clachan, Raasay, though the description by no means suits the place; but the “homestead without smoke under the wave-lashed rock” is Iain’s watery grave: cf. the lament mentioned above:

<gai>
Nochd gur h-ìosal do chluasag
Fo lic fhuaraidh na tuinne;
Is ann an clachan na tràghad (or gun tràghadh)
Tha mo ghràdh-sa ’na uirigh.
<eng>

The verses quoted I owe to Mr. Samuel Maclean of Raasay; they and others will be found in Songs of the Hebrides, II, 102.

347. rùsgadh a’ ghill: geall, a wager, stake, pledge, is common in poetry, and is used in several idiomatic phrases of which this is perhaps the commonest of the promise or pledge made by a warrior to do good execution in battle. Rùsgadh here seems to have the meaning of “make known, announce”; cf. “an àill leat mise a rùsgadh ceoil duit?”; an alternative meaning would be “make a clean sweep of”, in reference to the pledge or promise of the opponent. Cf. S. 498:

<gai>
Gun leòn gun sgìos, gu bràth cha phill
Gus an téid na gill a chur leo;
<eng>

Iain Lom, Oran do Dhomhnall mac Dhomhnaill mac Thriath Shléite:

<gai>
Dol a shiubhal nan stùcbheann,
Anns an uidhe gun chùram
Leis a’ bhuidhinn roimh ’n rùisgte na gill.
<eng>

Further examples are collected and discussed in BGh., whence the above explanation is taken.

352. In Maclean Sinclair’s Gaelic Bards (I, 95) it is said that Iain had two brothers; Mackenzie (History of the

[TD 117]

MacLeods, 369) says that he was an only son. The tradition of Raasay supports the former; one brother perished with him, and one remained to succeed him.


TUIREADH

The heading given to this song in the Duanaire is a strong confirmation of the tradition, vouched for by the Rev. Kenneth MacLeod among others, that a part of Mary’s exile was spent in Scarba. The heading in turn is perhaps confirmed to some extent by the third and fourth lines, which certainly suit Scarba better than Mull whose traditional claim is better known. Unfortunately we get no precise information from the poem either on this point or regarding Mary’s early history.

365. Uilbhinnis, Ullinish, a district in Bracadale in Skye. The following lines are not incompatible with the tradition that Mary was born in Harris.

375. As Sir Roderick Mor died in 1626, these lines are not inconsistent with the tentative suggestion of 1615 as the year of Mary’s birth; a slightly earlier date would perhaps suit them better, however, while any later date is to be rejected. Tradition records that she was in service in Dunvegan Castle, and it is quite possible that she entered that service when she was eleven or less, before Sir Roderick’s death.

This is among the best known of all Mary’s songs. It is addressed to Sir Norman of Bernera (l. 399), and was of course composed during her exile. Why it should be known as “MacLeod’s Lilt” is not very clear, as Sir Norman was never MacLeod, a style reserved for the chief.

394. Dhiùraidh á Sgarbaidh: the decision between the various readings is an important one. I have followed BGh. because (1) it seems clear that for a part of her exile Mary was in Scarba (see notes on Tuireadh and introduction); (2) a of E. is not nearly so likely to be the result of corruption as is or agus; (3) á is still heard from traditional singers, for example in Raasay, as Mr. John Maclean tells me.

417. A reference to the Irish connexions of the MacDonalds, to whom Sir Norman was related through his second wife, the daughter of Sir James MacDonald of Sleat, and through his mother, Isabel, daughter of Donald MacDonald of Glen Garry, after whom Sir Roderick Mór’s five sons were called “cóignear mhac uasal Iseabail”.

433 ff. We do not know when Sir Norman’s two younger brothers, William of Hamer and Donald of Greshornish, died; his elder brothers, Iain Mór and Sir Roderick of Talisker, died in 1649 and 1675 respectively; the poem is therefore later than 1675.

Mr. James Fraser, who was born in 1634, died in 1709, and commenced his Polichronicon in 1666, notes there that “that manly art” (of archery) “is wearing away by degrees, and the gun takeing place”. The last battle fought in Scotland in which bows are recorded to have been used was also the last clan battle, that of Maol Ruadh (Mulroy) in Lochaber, between the MacDonalds of Keppoch, under Colla nam bó, and the Mackintoshes of Moy (see T., p. 142, 143 ff.); it took place in 1688.

CRÒNAN AN TAIBH

From ll. 504 and 514 ff. it seems that Mary was not in either Skye or Harris when she composed this poem. From this and the general tone we may conclude that the poem belongs to the period of her exile; yet we cannot be precise as to its date, and it therefore affords no valuable evidence in that connexion. It is clear only that it was composed after 1666 (l. 582 n.); and no poem of her exile can be shown to be earlier than that date. A fragment was sung to Miss Tolmie in Bracadale and is printed in her Collection (98).

504. Pàdraig Mór Mac Cruimein, the famous piper of Sir Roderick Mór, on whose death he composed the Cumha Ruairidh Mhóir:

<gai>
Tog orm mo phìob is théid mi dhachaidh,
Is duilich leam fhéin, mo léir mar thachair;
Tog orm mo phìob ’s mì air mo chràdh
Mu Ruairidh Mór, mu Ruairidh Mór.

Tog orm mo phìob, tha mi sgìth,
Is mur faigh mi ì théid mi dhachaidh;
Tog orm mo phìob, tha mi sgìth
Is mì air mo chràdh mu Ruairidh Mór.

Tog orm mo phìob, tha mi sgìth,
Is mur faigh mi ì théid mi dhachaidh;
Clàrsach no pìob cha tog mo chrìdh,
Cha bheò fear mo ghràidh, Ruairidh Mór.
<eng>

Pàdraig is said to have accompanied Roderick of Talisker to London after the restoration of Charles II, and to have composed there the pìobaireachd “Thug mi pòg do làimh an Rìgh” on being allowed to kiss the King’s hand on that occasion (e.g. Mackenzie’s Hist. of the MacLeods, p. 103). From the Polichronicon, however, a contemporary account, it appears that the incident occurred in May, 1651, when

[TD 120]

the King’s army, a few weeks before the battle of Inverkeithing, was gathering at Stirling, and that the MacCrimmon concerned was not Patrick but John. The passage runs as follows (Wardlaw MS., p. 379): “It was pretty in a morning (the King) in parad viewing the regiments and bragads. He saw no less than 80 pipers in a crould bareheaded, and John M’gyurmen in the midle covered. He asked What society that was? It was told his Majesty: Sir, yow are our King, and yonder old man in the midle is the Prince of Pipers. He cald him by name, and, comeing to the King, kneeling, his Majesty reacht him his hand to kiss; and instantly played an extemporanian part Fuoris Pōōge i spoge i Rhī (Fuaras pòg o spòg an Rìgh), I got a kiss of the Kings hand; of which he and they all were vain.” The MacCrimmon family are fully discussed in Mr. Fred.

The path followed on these occasions is still partly traceable. (I owe this difficult identification to Miss C. M. MacVicar, Loch Aline.)


CUMHA DO MHAC LEOID

The formal subject of the lament is Roderick, seventeenth chief of Harris and Dunvegan, who succeeded his father Iain Breac in 1693; in fact, however, it deals also with his younger brother Norman, who, as Roderick had no son, was his prospective heir and did actually succeed him. We must suppose that news reached Mary, whether during her exile or later, of the death of both Roderick and Norman, by what cause we have no information. Roderick’s character, his abandonment of the traditional mode of life of a Gaelic noble, and his neglect of Dunvegan castle and its inmates made him an unpopular chief and were strongly censured by his father’s bard, Roderick Morrison, an Clàrsair Dall, in the famous Òran Mór Mhic Leoid; whether or not it was Roderick that caused Mary’s exile, she received his death without much regret. She praises

[TD 122]

his ancestors, and her praise of them and of Norman serves as a signal contrast to her silence regarding his personal qualities. Of her much warmer feeling towards Norman there is further proof in the following poem, which she composed on hearing that he had not after all shared his brother’s fate. Roderick died in 1699, and the poem can be assigned with certainty to that year.

615. gun abachadh meas: Roderick’s only child was a daughter; Norman was not yet married; William, the third and only other brother, was probably already dead.

685. From this and l. 691 it seems that Roderick died away from home. The burial place of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan was in Harris (cf. the heading of the lament for Sir Roderick Mór mentioned on p. xxxii). It has always been regarded in the Highlands as a misfortune to die and be buried away from home; the case of Thomas Lord Fraser, who was buried in Kilmuir as a sign of “the great love he bore the family of MacLeod”, is mentioned in the note to l. 825. Sir Roderick Mór was buried in the Chanonry of Ross (Fortrose Cathedral), where his recumbent grave-stone is still legible.

689. air an oighre: i.e. Norman, Roderick’s prospective heir.

690. staoidhle ’sna Hearadh: as stated in the note to l. 696, Harris was, whether rightly or wrongly, regarded by tradition as the original possession of the Sìol Tormoid or MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, though they had also held Glenelg since about 1343. Mackenzie, in discussing claims to the chiefship (History, p. 7) says that “in several royal charters, and other authentic documents, where the heads of the families are mentioned, the representatives of Tormod (are) usually styled MacLeods of Harris”, and this is the case in literature. Now that Harris no longer belongs to the MacLeods the chief is generally known as MacLeoid Dhùn Bheagain.

696. Manainn: Harald, lawful king, under Hacon, king of Norway, of the Norwegian kingdom of Man and the Isles after 1265, was succeeded in that kingdom by his only son Leodus. Leodus married Adama d. of Ferquhar earl of Ross

[TD 124]

(cf. l. 704) and had two sons, Torkell and Dormeth. To Torkell, the elder, he gave Lewis and Waternish; to Dormeth he gave Harris and his other lands in Skye, which was about the fourth part of what he gave to his eldest son. All their descendants “toock ther patronimick from Leod, sone to Harald, both thos who descendit of Torquill, . . . as thos who descendit of Dormeith, or, as the Highlanders pronunced, Tormett, heritor of the Herries.” Such is the account of the genealogy of Clan Leod given in the History of the Family of Mackenzie, written by the first Earl of Cromarty, Mary’s contemporary; and there is little doubt that this represents the tradition on which Mary is touching. The MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan are still commonly called Sìol Tormoid, those of Lewis Sìol Torcuill. A variation of this tradition is that Leod married the d. of Mac Raild, a Danish knight, and through her acquired her father’s lands including Dunvegan.

The whole of this account is rejected by Skene as the fabrication of the Earl, owing to the absence of literary evidence for such a genealogy before the writing of his work in 1669; the Chronicle of Man, a document of the greatest importance because contemporary with the events it narrates, makes no mention of Leod, although up to the year 1265 the Earl’s history is in close agreement with it; but the Chronicle is at this stage meagre; between 1265 and 1274 it records only (1266) the transference of the kingdom of Man and the Isles to Alexander king of the Scots; this the Earl places in 1270 or immediately after, saying that Alexander “gave to Harald . . . the Illes of Lewis, and that pairt of the Sky which he found then in the Norwegiane possessioun, viz. Vaternes, Meignanes, and the Herries, to be holdin in wassalladge of him and his successores, Kings of Scotland.” The absence of positive statement in the Chronicle is not to be taken as proof of the contrary; early poems dealing with the genealogy of MacLeod, did we possess them, might well show what is most likely to be the case, that the Earl is recounting current tradition. In the present context we are concerned not with the truth of that tradition, but with the fact that Mary was well acquainted with and used it (see Celt. Scot. and Highlanders; Chron. of Man, i, 110; Sir Wm. Fraser’s Earls of Cromartie, ii, 509 ff.).

Another account is given in Mr. James Fraser’s Polichronicon, commenced in 1666 (Ward. MS., p. 40): “Duncan (son of

[TD 125]

King Malcolm) enjoyed the crown but a very short time, with great trouble from England, quhen he is killed by M‘kpeudar (MacPeter), Thain of Merns, by the former Donalds procurement, who, to strengthen himselfe in his kingdom, conduced with Sueno 2, King of Norrowy, for assistance to recover the crown, he gave him the north and west Isles, which his race possesses to this day, viz. the Mackleuds. For Leodus, the sone of Oliverius Norwegie, possessed the Lewes, called so from Leodus, who had 4 sones, Torcil, Tormoid, Teah, and Teascil, who divided the country among them, Torcil possessing the Lewis, Tormoid the Haris, and the other two, parcells among them; upon them 4 the poet in that language gives this distich on

Schlichd Oliver shin nach duair baistig, tha buon maslig;
Ta Tormodich, agus Torkil, Teah, is Teaskill.

<gai>(Sliochd Olbhair sin nach d’fhuair baisteadh, tha buan masladh; Ta Tormodaich, agus Torcuill, Teah agus Teascuil.)<eng>

“The clan Torkil in Lewis were the stoutest and prettiest men, but a wicked bloody crew whom neither law nor reason could guid or moddell, destroying one another, till in end they were all expelled that country, and the M‘Kenzies now possess it. The poet gave them this satyr:

<gai>
She mi varrell er Chland Leod gir cossvil ead re Poir i Duse
The shin mis i is mo, Ichis i te is Oig Tuse.

Is e mo bharail air Chlann Leoid, gur cosmhail iad ri pòir … (?)
An té is sine, ma’s i as mó, itheas i an té as òige an tùs.”
<eng>

The Norse descent of the Clan Leod is a favourite theme with Mary; cf. l. 791 and note.

698. Olghar: see note to l. 791. Ochraidh: not identified.

699. Boirbhe, Beirbhe (N. Björgvín), Bergen, one of the principal cities of Norway. This is perhaps the only name of a place in Scandinavia which survives in modern Sc. Gaelic, and it has the article in Gaelic, an unusual feature in Norse names.

703. De shliochd àrmunn Chinn-tìre: a poetically general

[TD 126]

reference to Norman’s descent on his mother’s side from the MacDonalds of Sleat. To understand what was in Mary’s mind we must recall the struggles of Somerled, grandfather of Donald the eponymus of the Clan, to assert Gaelic sway in Argyll and the Isles against the Norse. Somerled, whose capacity for leadership put him in a position of such power that the Chronicle of Man credits him with the intention of conquering the whole of Scotland, and who met his death by treachery at Renfrew in the year 1164 while leading an army against the King of Scotland, defeated Godred the feudal King of Man and the Isles in a sea-fight off the north shore of Islay in 1156. The result of this was a brief peace between Gael and Norseman, on condition of Somerled receiving the Isles south of the point of Ardnamurchan, a territory which included Kintyre, and which was the ancient patrimony and earliest possession of the Clan Cholla in Scotland. On Somerled’s death these central territories of Islay and Kintyre went to his son Reginald, on whose death, in 1207, they passed to Donald the eponymous progenitor of Clan Donald. I do not think we have here any special reference to the family of MacAllister of Loup in Kintyre, said to be descended from Alasdair, second son of Donald and therefore an early cadet branch of Clan Donald. Islay and Kintyre remained central possessions of the Lords of the Isles, though at intervals in their history they acquired very large additions of territory.

The most important of these was the Earldom of Ross. A legitimate claim to it was advanced by Donald, fifth in descent from Donald son of Reginald, on behalf of his wife, Lady Mary Leslie, who became Countess of Ross in her own right. This claim Donald vindicated at the battle of Harlaw, in Aberdeenshire, in 1411, against an army sent to meet him by the Duke of Albany and led by the Earl of Mar. The united forces of Scotland, however, were too strong to permit him to take possession of Ross; the Earldom was bestowed by Albany in his capacity of regent of Scotland on his son the Earl of Buchan; it reverted to the crown in 1424; and it was probably not until soon after the death of James I, in 1437, that Donald’s son, Alexander, was granted possession of the title and estates of Ross, probably by the regents of the young king James II, in right of his mother, Countess of Ross. Alexander’s son John, the last Lord of the Isles, in consequence of many acts of war by himself and his son Angus against

[TD 127]

the crown of Scotland, was divested of the Earldom of Ross, and, in 1493, of all his other titles and estates.

There was then no earldom of Islay, but the Lords of the Isles being designated “de Ile”, “of Islay”, and being, as we have seen, Earls of Ross, Mary combines the two; so does Iain Lom, “Do Dhomhnall Gorm Og Mac Dhomhnaill Shléite”:

<gai>
“Aig ogha Iarla Ile
Agus Chinn-tìre,
Rois is Innse Gall.”
<eng>

The MacDonalds of Sleat are descended from Hugh, son of Alexander the first to enter into possession of the Earldom of Ross.

705 ff. Mhic Iain Stiùbhairt: the patronymic of the chief of Appin, at that time Robert Stewart of Appin, to whom was married Isabel, sister of Roderick and Norman, and to whom, through his wife, the estates of MacLeod might pass in the event of the death of Roderick and Norman, their only brother, William, having died unmarried. Alexander Mackenzie, in the belief that the poem was composed on the death of Roderick the fifteenth chief, gives that Roderick a son and daughter, against the evidence of Douglas’s Baronage, and marries the daughter out of hand to Stewart of Appin. The case of that Roderick does not meet the requirements of the poem.

an Apuinn, Appin, a district north of Loch Creran in Argyll: Apuinn Mhic Iain Stiùbhairt; distinguish from Apuinn a’ Mhèinnearaich, Appin of Menzies, which is Dull in Perthshire.

718. an fhir fhéilidh: Iain Breac. The reference no doubt includes William as well as Roderick and Norman.

719. Ruairidh Mór: Sir Roderick Mór, who died in 1626, the great-great-grandfather of Roderick and Norman.


AN CRÒNAN

Mary’s joy at finding the report of Norman’s death to be false finds full expression in An Crònan; besides being personally attached to him, she welcomed the prospect of a change of régime. Though Roderick is not mentioned, his degeneracy from the hereditary qualities of his house is indicated plainly

[TD 128]

enough in constant reminders to Norman of what is due to tradition, and in expressions of joy that the old order of hunting, feasting and open-handedness to the household will be renewed. Norman was, as the language of the poem would of itself show, a young man at his accession, but Mary’s hopes were not fulfilled for long; Norman married in 1703 Anne Fraser, daughter of Hugh Lord Lovat, and died before the birth of his son Norman in 1706. It is clear that the poem was composed very soon after the Cumha do Mhac Leoid. A fragment of it was sung to Miss Tolmie in Bracadale in 1862; see her Collection, No. 99.

723. The physician, i.e. God, says Miss Tolmie; perhaps rather the bearer of the message.

725. The reading of E. and M., theannas, is the relative fut., used commonly enough, though ungrammatically, in colloquial speech in place of the independent fut.

736. àrmunn: Iain Breac.

751. dùn ud nan cliar: Dunvegan.

779. socrach ri tuaith: a common sentiment; cf. Iain Lom to Mackinnon of Strath: “Cha b’e am fasan bh’aig càch / So ghlac e mar ghnàth / Bhith smachdail mu’n mhàl air tuaith.”

791. Olghar: cf. ll. 521, 698, 875, 1148.

“In the classic bardic poetry the name is Olbhur, and occurs frequently, e.g. in the elegy on Sir Norman aicme Olbhuir (thrice).—RC., II, 264; a poem in Nat. Lib. MS., addressed to William MacLeod, son of Sir Norman, has—

<gai>
Mac í Olbhuir mur thuinn thoruidh (rann 12),
Triath do ríoghfhuil aicme Olbhuir (rann 23).
<eng>

Olghar, Olbhur is perhaps to be equated with Oilmor of the MacLeod genealogy as printed in Celt. Scot., III, 460, where he appears as great-grandfather of Leod, the eponymus of the clan. The name is obviously the Norse Olver: seven men of that name are mentioned in Landnámabók.”—BGh.

807. Sliochd Ruairidh, the race of Sir Roderick Mór. The descendants of his eleven children are too many to enumerate. The most prominent at this date were Sir Norman of Bernera, and the representatives of the houses of Talisker, Hamer, and Greshornish, founded respectively by Sir Roderick of Talisker, Tutor of MacLeod, William, and Donald, Sir

[TD 129]

Roderick Mór’s second, third and fourth sons. Besides these, through Sir Roderick Mór’s daughters Norman had marriage ties with, among others, the houses of Maclean of Duart, Maclean of Coll, MacDonald of Clan Ranald, MacDonald of Glen Garry, MacLeod of Raasay; and through the daughters of John, Sir Roderick’s eldest son and successor, with these and other houses.

812. Sir Domhnall a Sléite: Mary, daughter of Iain Mór of Dunvegan, married Sir James MacDonald IX of Sleat; Florence, Sir James’s daughter, was wife of Iain Breac and mother of the present Norman. This Sir Donald is Sir James’s grandson, XI of Sleat, who succeeded in 1695 and died in 1718.

819. Mac mhic Ailein: this must refer to Alan, chief of Clan Ranald since 1686, who was mortally wounded at Sheriffmuir. The version of E. and SO. seems impossible, for it is apparently certain that Alan had no son: so Mary’s younger contemporary, Sìlis na Ceapaich:

<gai>
Beir soraidh gu h-Ailean o’n chuan
Bha greis anns an Fhraing uainn air chuairt;
Is e ro mheud do ghaisge
Chum gun oighre air do phearsa.
<eng>

The lines in E. and SO. may arise from contamination with some other poem.

The version of M. has, as noted, “Mac Mhic Ailein is da Mhac Dhonuill”, which, written thus, is an extraordinary phrase, as Mac Dhomhnaill is the style of the chief of that name only, and is therefore not applicable to more than one man at a time. Capital letters, however, are used indiscriminately in M., and we should perhaps read “dà mhac Dhomhnaill”, “the two sons of Donald”. There remains to identify these; we may suppose them to be James of Orinsay, who was later for a short time chief of the house, and William of Vallay, sons of Sir Donald who died in 1695, and brothers of the Sir Donald mentioned in the previous stanza. The latter had only one son. With this identification we may compare again Sìlis na Ceapaich:

<gai>
Beir soraidh gu Domhnall o’n Dùn,
Gu h-Uilleam ’s gu Seumas ’nan triuir.
<eng>

[TD 130]

825. Mac Shimidh: Fraser of Lovat. It is probable, though we cannot be certain, that the Crònan was composed after May, 1699. In that month died Thomas Lord Fraser, and was succeeded by his son Simon, who erected in the churchyard of Kilmuir a monument to his father bearing an inscription which is quoted in Mackenzie’s History of the MacLeods. Lord Thomas married Sibella, daughter of Iain Mór, and, says the inscription, “for the great love he bore the family of MacLeod, he desired to be buried near his wife’s relations, in the place where two of her uncles lay. And his son, Lord Simon, to show to posterity his great affection for his mother’s kindred, the brave MacLeods, chooses rather to leave his father’s bones with them than carry them to his own burial place near Lovat.” Lord Simon was beheaded in 1746 for his share in the ’45.

MacDougall, Glasgow, a native of Coll, for the information (1) that the place-name is masculine; (2) that to the north-west of the old castle is

some elevated ground where the rock is all of the red quartz variety, a rare thing in Coll, where grey gneiss with dykes of basalt predominates. This part is thus so red in appearance that the region is called “na creagan dearga”. The dhearg of M., which preserves the rime, has therefore been adopted, with change of gender.

Donald, the tenth Maclean of Coll, who died in 1729, married first Isabella, daughter of Sir Roderick of Talisker, and secondly Marian, daughter of Sir Norman of Bernera.


FUIGHEALL

“On her passage from Mull to Skye,” says John Mackenzie (i.e. at the end of her period of exile), Mary “composed a song, of which only a fragment can now be procured”. Once again, we are disappointed to find that we can extract no certain information from this fragment. The question must arise whether her destination was Dunvegan, the seat of the chief, or Bernera, the residence of Sir Norman. The words of l. 866 constitute the only tangible evidence for the latter, and we are probably safe in accepting Mackenzie’s statement that her passage was to Skye. Dunvegan would be her natural destination, and especially the abode of the chief is indicated by dùthaich Mhic Leoid (l. 861) and ll. 872 and 903, for Mary is consistent in applying the proper style MacLeod to the chief alone. The title of the song Luinneag Mhic Leoid is no disproof of this, for it was probably not given by Mary. The expression in l. 866, therefore, referring to her passage westward, probably does not mean that she was bound for Harris.

If this is so, we can give only a poetic interpretation to the phrase. So far as we know, she set out for Dunvegan from either Sgarbaidh or as Mackenzie says from Mull. If from the former, the expression can be taken literally only if we suppose it to apply to the first part of the voyage to Dunvegan by way of the Sound of Iona. If we are content to concede to her a poetic licence, the phrase is as well used of a voyage from Aros as of one from Sgarbaidh north through the Sound of Mull; in either case it can only loosely describe the first part of the voyage, which is of course on the whole northwards and not westwards.

872. MacLeoid: probably Norman; see over.

[TD 132]

873. an t-òg: this well suits the supposition that the MacLeod who recalled Mary was Norman the eighteenth chief, who as we know was a young man at his accession.

875. see 791 n.

884. Sìol Tormoid: the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan; see note on l. 696.

905. Aros: àrois of SO. is certainly wrong, for the dative of àros, dwelling, mansion, is àros; if we suppose the word to be simply a common noun, the phrase àros an fhìon is certainly not such as we should associate with Sgarbaidh, which, so far as is known, was never the abode of any person of importance. As the text stands, there is a pun on Aros, the place-name, àros, mansion, and talla, hall.


DO MHAC DHOMHNAILL

Headed in the MS. “Le Mairi nighean Alasdair
Ruaidh mhic Leòid, an té sheinn An Crònan”

The poem is addressed to Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat, who succeeded his father, Sir Donald, in 1695. He was known as Domhnall Gorm Og, or more particularly as Domhnall a’ Chogaidh from the part he played in the war on behalf of James VII. At the Battle of Killiecrankie he commanded the forces of the clan in place of his father, who fell ill after setting out; in reference to this Iain Lom, in a poem on Cath Raon Ruairidh, says:

<gai>
Mo ghaol an Domhnall Gorm Og
O’n Tùr Shléiteach ’s o’n Ord;
Fhuair thu deuchainn ’s bu mhór an sgeula e.

Mo ghaol an Tàinistear ùr
Is a gheur Spàinneach ’na smùid:
Cha b’e an t-ùmaidh air chùl na sgéithe e.
<eng>

Nor did the resistance of Sir Donald and his son to the government of King William end at Killiecrankie. They united with the other Jacobite chiefs in a refusal to submit on any terms (1), and Sir Donald’s house in Sleat, like those of other


(1) Cf. a letter printed in Browne’s History of the Highlands, ii, 183.

[TD 133]

of the island chiefs, suffered bombardment by two government frigates. The Earl of Argyll received a commission “to reduce him if he does not speedily surrender”, referring to which a letter in the Sleat charter chest from the chief’s cousin, Hugh MacDonald, captain in General Mackay’s regiment, quoted in Clan Donald, urges the chief to signify his submission in “a very obliging letter” to General Mackay. “Lord Morton (see note on l. 977) appears in your interest, and advises you to write to Argyll an obliging letter, for he assures me that Argyll professes much kindness for you. This will not only keep Argyll from invading your country, but likewise make him befriend you at Court. I beseech you not to bring ruin upon yourself by papists and desperat people that resort to your island. Lord Morton would go on foot to London on condition that your peace was made.” The terms of Sir Donald’s ultimate surrender we do not know.

The younger Sir Donald, subject of the present poem, appears to have taken an active part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, and his estates were forfeited. He died in 1718. We do not know at what stage in his career the poem was composed, but as he is already Sir Donald it must have been after 1695. The poem affords Mary a good opportunity for the conventional but spirited enumeration of MacDonald’s allies; some of them would have done less for Sir Donald than Mary would have us believe.

In Alex. MacDonald’s Story and Song from Loch Ness-side (p. 288) we are told that the following stanzas were well known in that district, and that the tradition concerning them was that they were a part of a composition by Màiri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh, when she discovered, pretty well advanced in years, that she was the daughter not of one Alexander MacLeod but of a distinguished MacDonald of the time:

This extraordinary tradition of Mary’s parentage seems to be quite unknown in Skye or Harris, and was in all probability the result of a misinterpretation of the somewhat curious wording of the poem itself.

935. Dùn-tuilm, in Trotternish, was at this time the principal residence of MacDonald. It was inhabited as late as 1715 (Pennant’s Tour, ii, 303).

949. Mac Coinnich: Mackenzie of Kintail, no doubt Coinneach òg, an active Jacobite, who succeeded his father in 1678 and died in Paris in 1701. With Mackenzie of Kintail, as with most of the other families mentioned, the house of Sleat was connected by marriage; Sir Donald himself was the grandson of Margaret, daughter of Sir Roderick Mackenzie of Cóigeach, the Taoitear Tàileach.

955. The MacDonalds in general, “the seed of Art and Conn and Cormac”. Conn Ceudchathach, Conn of the Hundred Battles, was High King of Ireland, according to the Annals, from 123 to 157 A.D. He was father of Art, who was father of Cormac. Cormac’s great-grandsons were the three Collas, who were banished from Ireland to Scotland and there acquired territory. “Téid arís Colla Uais go n-a bhráithribh i nAlbain agus gabhaid fearann mór innte; gonadh ón gColla Uais sin tángadar clann nDomhnaill na hAlban agus na hEireann” (see Keating, ii, 382). See note on l. 1155.

An Caiptein Mùideartach: Alan of Clan Ranald succeeded his father in 1686 at the age of thirteen, and at the age of sixteen accompanied his cousin and guardian, MacDonald of Benbecula, to the Battle of Killiecrankie at the head of five hundred men. The poem being probably after 1695, Alan had by now become reconciled to the government of King William, two of the sureties for his good behaviour being Argyll and Viscount Tarbat.

With Kintyre also we associate the MacAllisters of Loup, who derive their name from Alasdair, son of Donald, the progenitor of Clan Donald.

The expression is an ancient one; cf.

LUINNEAG DO IAIN MAC SHIR TORMOID

This song is still known in part in Harris. It is addressed to John, eldest son of Sir Norman of Bernera, sometimes called Iain Taoitear, as guardian of Norman, the nineteenth chief of MacLeod, who was born after his father’s death. John was an advocate at the Scottish bar.

The occasion of the poem is the presentation to the poetess of a snuff-mull (bràth), or, as some in Harris say, a quern, and the first two stanzas deal playfully with this subject.

1004. gun iarann air: “unshod”; the iron parts of a mill are a square block of iron (dealgan) let into the iron socket (dual) in the centre of the upper millstone; and the cylindrical iron bolt (torghann) inserted in the iron lunn, on which the propellor rests and rotates. A Lewis ballad runs:

<gai>

MARBHRANN DO SHIR TORMOD

This poem is entitled in E. Oran le Inghin Alastair ruaigh do Mac Leod, and in SO. simply Cumha Mhic Leoid.

Sir Norman MacLeod of Bernera, to whom it is addressed, was the third son of Sir Roderick Mór of Harris and Dunvegan, and born in Bernera. His contract of fosterage, between Sir Roderick and “Eoin mac mic Cainnigh”, is among the National MSS. of Scotland, dated 8th October, 1614; at that date he was probably about five years old. Of his early life little is known. When in 1650 Charles II crossed to Scotland, Roderick of Talisker, Norman’s brother, raised a regiment of about 700, most of them MacLeods, to support the King; and Norman received the Lieut.-Colonelcy of this force. Both brothers fought at Worcester (1651), where the MacLeod forces were so reduced that, it is said, by common consent the clan was absolved from military service until it should recover. Norman was taken prisoner, confined for eighteen months, and tried for his life; owing to the similarity of his name to the Welsh Llwyd, Lloyd, he was stated in the indictment to be a Welshman, and through this flaw the trial was held up and Norman sent again to prison. Thence he escaped, and afterwards returned to Skye. After the defeat of Worcester Charles retired to the Continent; but his supporters in the Highlands were not idle, and in 1653 Norman was dispatched to him at Chantilly with a letter signed by the chiefs of the loyal clans informing him of affairs in the Highlands. It is a sign of the eminent place occupied by the MacLeods among the Jacobite clans that the message which Charles sent in reply was addressed to Sir Roderick of Talisker. After the defeat of General Middleton at Loch Garry in 1654, the royalist leaders and chiefs decided that no more could at present be accomplished for the cause; Norman opened his house in Bernera to the defeated generals, and from there they escaped to the Continent. In 1659 he undertook a mission on behalf of Charles to the court of Denmark, which procured a promise of no less than 10,000 troops; these however were never called upon; General Monk abandoned his support of Richard Cromwell, and the Restoration was accomplished. Roderick and Norman immediately gave their allegiance to the King in

[TD 139]

London, and were knighted, as they well deserved to be. Mary’s tribute to his loyalty, then (ll. 1223–4), is no more than the truth.

Sir Norman died on the third day of March, 1705, as appears from the dating verse in an elegy upon him from the Book of Clan Ranald, printed in RC. II, 264 ff.:

<gai>
Seacht ccéd dég sa dó re ríom
strí bliadhna aois a nairdríogh
órslath budh cneasda do chí
go teasda romhac ruaidhrí,
<eng>

translated there:

Seventeen hundred and two to be reckoned
and three years the age of the supreme king,
a gold wand the purest to be seen,
to the death of the excellent son of Rory.

So also an anonymous elegy:

<gai>
Seacht gcéad dég ’s a cúig gan chol,
ég Thormóid, doirbh an deadhol;
ré comháireamh is é sin
annáladh Dé go deimhin;<eng>
(see p. 106.)

Mary mentions the day but not the year. The poem can thus be ascribed with certainty to the year 1705.

1075. iuchair mo chùil: The exact meaning seems to me uncertain Iuchair possibly means not key but keystone, as in Irish; “the keystone of my support (cùl).” Cùil may be gen. not of cùl but of cùil, nook, secret place, pantry, in the sense of store-house, treasure-house, by confusion with cuile of that meaning. Perhaps we should read chiuil, “the key of my music”; cf. a eochracha éigse, his keys of poesy (Dinn.); iuchair ghliocais; iuchair nam bàrd, rìgh nam filidh (BGh. vocab.).

1095. Here and at l. 1130 ff. the translation is derived from BGh.

1148. Olghar: see note to l. 791.

1155. sìol Cholla: the Clan Donald. “Is follus fós gurab ré linn Mhuireadhaigh Tírigh do chuadar na trí Cholla go n-a mbráithribh ó Chonnachtaibh do dhéanamh gabháltais ar Ulltaibh, gur bheanadar roinn mhór do Chúigeadh Uladh dhíobh ar éigin, mar atá, Modhairn Uí mac Uais is Uí Chriomhthainn go bhfuilid drong mhór dhíobh da haitiughadh aniú, mar atá Raghnall mac Samhairle Iarla Antruim nó nAondroma ó Cholla Uais; &c:” “It is also well known that it was in the time of Muireadhach Tìreach (d. A.D. 335) that the three Collas with their kinsmen left Connaught to win conquests from the Ultonians, and wrested by force from them a large portion of the province of Ulster, namely Modhairn, Ui Mac Uais and Ui Chriomhthainn; and many of their descendants hold possession of these to-day, as Raghnall son of Samhairle, Earl of Antrim, or Aondrom, descended from Colla Uais; &c.” (Keating, ed. Dinneen, Vol. II, p. 100). Colla Uais, the most famous of the three, was the alleged progenitor of the Clan Donald (see note on l. 955); and the reference here is to Sir Norman’s mother, Isabel daughter of Donald MacDonald of Glen Garry. Mary MacLeod’s knowledge of tradition is notable. Further information about the three Collas is given in the Book of Clan Ranald (RC. II, 151 ff., given also in Celt. Scot. III, appendix 1, in translation); for the clans supposed to be descended from Colla Uais, see Celt. Scot. index.

1167. Inghean Sheumais nan crùn: Catherine, eldest daughter of Sir James MacDonald IX of Sleat (Seumas Mór), married Sir Norman as his second wife in 1666. Her sister Florence was wife of Iain Breac of Harris and Dunvegan.

“Nan crùn” holds the same idea as is more fully expressed in l. 1209.

CUMHA DO SHIR TORMOD

1216. am Mac Leoid-sa: the reference is certainly to the chief, no doubt Norman, to whom the Crònan, who died shortly afterwards, before the birth of his son in 1706. Sir Norman, in virtue of his age and capacities, naturally held a position of great authority in the councils of his clan, especially since the death of Sir Roderick of Talisker, the Tutor, in 1675.

The following version of the Cumha do Shir Tormod was taken down in 1861 from Mairi bheag nighean Domhnaill mhic Ruairidh, Ebost, Skye, by Miss Tolmie, and is printed in the MacD. Coll., p. 150. It bears clear signs of having been curtailed and corrupted by oral transmission, though it contains some lines that may be closer to the original than the received text. The first four verses are in Miss Tolmie’s Coll.

In their note to the above the editors say rather strangely that its subject is Roderick, the fifteenth MacLeod of Dunvegan, of whom they say Mary sang, on his death in 1664, the fragment printed on p. xxxiii. It is clear that the subject is Sir Norman, who died in 1705.


NOTES ON THE METRES

1. Regular Strophe: (a) (2) Consisting of a phrase of two stresses, thrice repeated, and with end-rime, followed by a half-phrase containing a rime which is carried throughout the poem. The full phrases, which may be stressed on the ultimate or the penultimate syllable, sometimes contain internal rime, but this is irregular. The poems in this metre are: An Talla am bu Ghnàth le Mac Leoid, Crònan an Taibh, Cumha do Shir Tormod, Fuigheall. In the first three the final half-phrase consists of two syllables with the stress on the second; in the Fuigheall it consists of three syllables with the stress on the first, giving the entire strophe a fine rolling swing very different from the mournful effect of the other.

These are briefly expressed as, e.g.:

3 (Ri fuaim an taibh) m’ àbhaist.


(1) “’N a chunnaic,” MacD. Coll.

(2) The metre which Mary MacLeod has been wrongly thought to have invented.

[TD 143]

(b) Consisting of a phrase of two stresses, six times repeated, with end-rime and inconstant internal rime, followed by a half-phrase of two syllables with stress on the penultimate and carrying its rime throughout the poem. This is found in Marbhrann do Fhear na Comraich:

6 (Tha mise air leaghadh le bròn) éirigh.

2. Irregular Strophe: (a) Marbhrann do Shir Tormod, which contains two types of strophe, (1) a phrase with two stresses, the second being on the penultimate syllable, six times repeated, with end-rime and usually internal rime, followed by a half-phrase of two syllables with one stress on the penult and carrying its rime throughout the poem:

6 (Cha sùrd cadail) éisdeachd;

and (2) a phrase of two stresses, the second being on the ultimate syllable, six to eight times repeated, followed by a half-phrase of three syllables with one stress on the penult:

6–8 (Is trom an cudthrom so dhrùidh) cha téid mi.

(b) An Crònan, which consists of the type last mentioned, the double-stressed phrase being repeated from five to seven times:

5–7 (An naidheachd so an dé) ri crònan.

(c) Marbhrann do Iain Garbh is of the same type, except that the final half-phrase is of three or four syllables, with stress on the penult or antepenult; but two strophes are of the type of Marbhrann do Shir Tormod (1), save that the double-stressed phrase is repeated seven and eight times, and is followed by a four-syllable half-phrase with one stress:

5–7 (Mo bheud ’s mo chràdh) an Ratharsaidh.

(d) Do Mhac Dhomhnaill. This is a rather unusual metre, consisting of a phrase with two chief stresses, the second being on the antepenultimate syllable, repeated from four to six times, with end-rime and inconstant internal rime, followed by a single-stressed phrase in the end-rime, followed in turn by a three-syllable phrase stressed on the penult and carrying its rime throughout the poem:

Tha ulaidh orm an uamharrachd
Mo ghibhte phrìseil uasal thu

[TD 144]

Mo leug bu lìonmhor buadhan thu
Chan fhaigh an Rìgh ri t’fhuasgladh thu
Air m’fhocal fìor o’n fhuair mi thu
Cha tugainn uam air òr thu.

3. Cumha, in the form of quatrains. The structure is one of four long lines (printed for convenience as eight short lines), each with four stresses, the second and third stressed words riming within each line, and the final stressed word riming throughout the rann. There are three poems in this metre, the Cumha do Mhac Leoid, Luinneag do Iain, and Luinneag Mhic Leoid. The last is peculiar in its repetition of the final line of the rann as the first line of the next rann; “this may be regarded as an extension of conchlann, ‘a grasp’, a term used to denote the repetition of the final word of a rann as the first word of the next” (BGh.).

Ex. (as usual the internal rime is not quite constant):

Is mi am shuidhe air an tulaich
fo mhulad ’s fo imcheist
Is mi ag coimhead air Ile
is ann de m’iongnadh ’san ám so
Bha mi uair nach do shaoil mi
gus an do chaochail air m’aimsir
Gun tiginn an taobh so
dh’amharc Dhiùraidh á Sgarbaidh.

4. Amhran, in the form of single long lines, printed for convenience as a couplet. (a) Each long line has four stresses, the second and third stressed words riming, and the final stressed word carrying its rime throughout the poem. The two examples are Mairearad nan Cuireid and An t-Eudach.

Ex.: Tha mo chean air an lasgair, saighdear sgairteil fo sgéith thu.

(b) Pòsadh Mhic Leoid and Tuireadh. Each long line has four stresses, and in the Tuireadh the rime of the last stressed syllable is continued throughout the poem. In the Pòsadh the rime of the last stressed syllable is changed frequently.
