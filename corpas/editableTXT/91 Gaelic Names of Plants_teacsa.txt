PREFACE.

THE Gaelic Names of Plants, reprinted from a series of articles in the ‘Scottish Naturalist,’ which have appeared during the last four years, are published at the request of many who wish to have them in a more convenient form. There might, perhaps, be grounds for hesitation in obtruding on the public a work of this description, which can only be of use to comparatively few; but the fact that no book exists containing a complete catalogue of Gaelic names of plants is at least some excuse for their publication in this separate form. Moreover, it seemed to many able botanists that, both for scientific and philological reasons, it would be very desirable that an attempt should be made to collect such names as are still used in the spoken Gaelic of Scotland and Ireland, before it became too late by the gradual disappearance of the language. Accordingly the author undertook this task at the request of the Editor of the ‘Scottish Naturalist,’ Dr Buchanan White, F.L.S. If the difficulties of its accomplishment had been foreseen, he would have hesitated to make the attempt; as it is, nearly ten years of his life have been occupied in searching through vocabularies, reading Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and generally trying to bring into order the confusion to which these names have been reduced partly by the carelessness of the compilers of Dictionaries, and frequently by their botanical ignorance. To accomplish this, numerous journeys had to be undertaken among


[DA 8]

the Gaelic-speaking populations, in order, if possible, to settle disputed names, to fix the plant to which the name was applied, and to collect others previously unrecorded.

In studying the Gaelic nomenclature of plants, it soon became evident that no collection would be of any value unless the Irish-Gaelic names were incorporated. Indeed, when the lists supplied by Alexander McDonald (Mac-Mhaighster-Alastair), published in his vocabulary in 1741, are examined, they are found to correspond with those in much older vocabularies published in Ireland. The same remark applies, with a few exceptions, to the names of plants in Gaelic supplied by the Rev. Mr Stewart of Killin, given in Lightfoot’s ‘Flora Scotica.’ Undoubtedly, the older names have been preserved in the more copious Celtic literature of Ireland; it is certainly true that “In vetustâ Hibernicâ fundamentum habet.” The investigations of Professor O’Curry, O’Donovan, and others, have thrown much light on this as well as upon many other Celtic topics. The Irish names are therefore included, and spelt according to the various methods adopted by the different authorities; this gives the appearance of a want of uniformity to the spelling not altogether agreeable to Gaelic scholars, but which, under the circumstances, was unavoidable.

It was absolutely essential that the existing Gaelic names should be assigned correctly. The difficulty of the ordinary botanical student was here reversed: he has the plant but cannot tell the name—here the name existed, but the plant required to be found to which the name applied. Again, names had been altered from their original form by transcription and pronunciation; it became a matter of difficulty to determine the root word. However, the recent progress of philology, the knowledge of the laws that govern the modifications of words in the brotherhood of European languages, when applied to these names, rendered the explanation given not altogether improbable. Celts named plants often from (1), their uses; (2), their appearance; (3), their habitats; (4),


[DA 9]

their superstitious associations, &c. The knowledge of this habit of naming was the key that opened many a difficulty.

For the sake of comparison a number of Welsh names is given, selected from the oldest list of names obtainable,—those appended to Gerard’s ‘Herbalist,’ 1597.

The author cannot sufficiently express his obligation to numerous correspondents in the Highlands and in Ireland for assistance in gathering local names; without such help it would have been impossible to make a complete collection. Notably the Rev. A. Stewart, Nether Lochaber, whose knowledge of natural history is unsurpassed in his own sphere; the Very Rev. Canon Bourke, Claremorris, who gave most valuable assistance in the Irish names, particularly in the etymology of many abstruse terms, his accurate scholarship, Celtic and classical, helping him over many a difficulty; Mr W. Brockie, an excellent botanist and philologist, who some years ago made a collection of Gaelic names of plants which was unfortunately destroyed, placed at the author’s disposal valuable notes and information relative to this subject; and lastly, the accomplished Editor of the ‘Scottish Naturalist,’ who, from its commencement, edited the sheets and secured the correct scientific order of the whole.

With every desire to make this work as free from errors as possible, yet, doubtless, some have escaped attention; therefore, any names omitted, any mistake in the naming of the plants, or any other fact tending towards the further elucidation of this subject will be thankfully received for future addition, correction, or amendment.

<gai>Uath<eng> or <gai>huath<eng>—the ancient Gaelic and Irish name—has several significations; but the root seems to be hu (Celtic), that which pervades. Welsh: huad, that which smells or has a scent (huadgu, a hound that scents). “The name hawthorn is supposed to be a corruption of the Dutch hoeg, a hedge-thorn. Although the fruit is generally called a haw, that name is derived from the tree which produces it, and does not, as is frequently supposed, take its name from the fruit it bears.”—Jones.

Thy sweet and fragrant fruits,
Apples and pears.

The old form of the word was <gai>adhul<eng> or <gai>abhul.<eng> The culture of apples must have been largely carried on in the Highlands in olden times, as appears from lines by Merlin, who flourished in A.D. 470, of which the following is a translation:—

“Sweet apple-tree loaded with the sweetest fruit, growing in the lonely wilds of the woods of Celyddon (Dunkeld), all seek thee for the sake of thy produce, but in vain; until Cadwaldr comes to the conference of the ford of Rheon, and Conan advances to oppose the Saxons in their career.”

This poem is given under the name of Afallanau, or Orchard, by which Merlin perhaps means Athol—i.e., Abhal or Adhul—which is believed by etymologists to acquire its name from its fruitfulness in apple-trees. <gai>Goirteag<eng> (from <gai>goirt,<eng> bitter), the sour or bitter one (the crab-apple). <gai>Cuairtagan<eng> (the fruit); <gai>cuairt,<eng> round, the roundies.

Fo rosg a dh-iathas dlù,
Gruidhean mar na caoran
Fo n’ aodann tha leam cùin.”<eng>—AN CAILIN DILEAS DONN.

Thine eyes are like the blaeberry,
Full and fresh upon the brae,

Gaelic: <gai>farusgag,<eng> from <gai>farusg,<eng> the inner rind, the part used being the lower part of the receptacle of the flower, freed from the bristles and seed-down, and the lower part of the leaves of the involucre. <gai>Bliosan,<eng> not unlikely to be a contraction from <gai>bli-liosan,—bli (bligh),<eng> milk (with its florets milk was formerly coagulated); and <gai>lios,<eng> a garden. These names apply also to Helianthus tuberosus, Jerusalem artichoke, especially to the tubers; and <gai>plur na greine,<eng> to the flower, from the popular error that the flower turns with the sun.

Centaurea nigra—Knapweed. Gaelic: <gai>cnapan dubh,<eng> the black knob (from <gai>cnap,<eng> a knob; Welsh, Armoric, and Irish: <gai>cnap;<eng> Saxon: cnæp; Danish cnap.) <gai>Mullach dubh,<eng> the black top.

Filago germanica—Common cotton rose. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>liath lus roid,<eng> the gall (or wormwood) grey weed.


(1) The occasional occurrence of Gothic roots in plants’ names in the Western Highlands and Isles, is accounted for by the conquest of these parts by the Norwegians in the ninth century, and the fact of their rule existing there for at least two centuries under the sway of the Norwegian kings of Man and the Isles.

Welsh: celyn, tree, shelterer or protector; cel, conceal, shelter, cover.

And the hazel out of the bush.

Welsh: onen, corresponding to another Irish name, <gai>nion.<eng> Gaelic: <gai>nuin,<eng> and also <gai>oinsean.<eng> The names refer principally to the wood, and the primary idea seems to be lasting, long-continuing, on (in Welsh), that which is in continuity. <gai>Uimh,<eng> number; <gai>seann,<eng> ancient, old; <gai>ùine,<eng> time, season. <gai>Nuin,<eng> also the letter N. Heb., nun. <gai>Fuinnseann<eng> (see Circæa), though from the same root, may have been suggested by its frequent use in the charms and enchantments so common in olden times, especially against the bites of serpents, and the influence of the “Old Serpent.” Pennant, in 1772, mentions: “In many parts of the Highlands, at the birth of a child, the nurse puts the end of a green stick of ash into the fire, and while it is burning, receives into a spoon the sap or juice which oozes out at the other end, and administers this to the new-born babe.” Serpents were supposed to have a special horror of its leaves.

<gai>“Theid an nathair troimh an teine dhearg
Mu’n teid i troimh dhuilleach an ùinnsinn.”<eng>

The serpent will go through fire, rather than through the leaves of the ash.

The same superstition was equally common in other countries, and the name “ash,” which is said to be from the Celtic word æsc, a pike, is more likely to be from the word <gai>asc,<eng> a snake, an adder. (1) German: die esche.

[TD 64]

U. urens/dioica—Nettle (Anglo-Saxon nœdl, a needle).

Latin: ungues.

<gai>“Sealbhaichidh an t’ ionntagach.”<eng>—HOSEA.
The nettles shall possess them.

To this day it is boiled in the Highlands and in Ireland by the country people in the spring-time. Till tea became the fashion, nettles were boiled in meal, and made capital food. <gai>Caol-fàil—caol,<eng> slender; <gai>fàl,<eng> spite, malice. In the Hebrides often called <gai>sradag<eng> (a spark), from the sensation (like that from a fiery spark) consequent upon touching. (Stuart.)

Cannabis sativa—Hemp. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>caineab,<eng> the same as cannabis, and said to be originally derived from Celtic, <gai>can,<eng> white; but the plant has been known to the Arabs from time immemorial under the name of quaneb. <gai>Corcach,<eng> hemp.

<gai>“Buill do’ n chaol chòrcaidh.”<eng>—M‘DONALD.
Tackling of hempen ropes.

(1) <gai>“Neandog,<eng> the common name for it in Ireland. In feminine nouns, the first consonant (letter) after the article an (the) is softened in sound. <gai>‘An feanntag’<eng>—‘f’ when affected loses its sound, and ‘N’ is sounded instead: ‘N (f)eantog.’”—CANON BOURKE.


[TD 65]

paries, a wall. Irish: <gai>mionntas chàisil (càisiol,<eng> any stone building), the wall-mint. For <gai>mionntas,<eng> see Mentha.

Humulus lupulus—Hop. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>lus an leanna—lionn luibh,<eng> the ale or beer plant. <gai>Lionn, leann<eng> (Welsh, lhyn) beer, ale.

Ulmus—Elm. Celtic: <gai>ailm.<eng> The same in Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic, Gothic, and nearly all the Celtic dialects. Hebrew: [Eabhrais], elah, translated oak, terebinth, and elm.

U. campestris—Gaelic and Irish: <gai>leamhan, slamhan<eng> (Shaw), <gai>liobhan.<eng> Welsh: llwyfen. According to Pictet, in his work, ‘Les Origines Indo-Europeennes ou les Aryas Primitifs,’ p. 221, “To the Latin: ‘Ulmus’ the following bear an affinity (respond)—Sax.: ellm. Scand.: almr. Old German: elm. Rus.: ilemu. Polish: ilma. Irish: <gai>ailm, uilm,<eng> and by inversion, <gai>‘leamh,’<eng> or <gai>‘leamhan.’”<eng> He says the root is ul, meaning to burn. The tree is called from the finality of it, “to be burned.” That is his opinion, and he is probably right. The common idea of <gai>leamhan<eng> is that it is from <gai>leamh,<eng> tasteless, insipid, from the taste of its inner bark; and <gai>liobh<eng> means smooth, slippery. And the tree in Gaelic poetry is associated with or symbolic of slipperiness of character, indecision. Cicely M‘Donald, who lived in the reign of Charles II., describing her husband, wrote as follows:—

<gai>“Bu tu’ n t-iubhair as a choille,
Bu tu’ n darach daingean làidir,
Bu tu’ n cùileann, bu tu ’n droighionn,
Bu tu’ n t’ abhall molach, blàth-mhor,
Cha robh meur annad do’ n chritheann,
Cha robh do dhlighe ri feàrna,
Cha robh do chàirdeas ri leamhan,
Bu tu leannan nam ban àluinn.”<eng>

Thou wast the yew from the wood,
Thou wast the firm strong oak,
Thou wast the holly and the thorn,
Thou wast the rough, pleasant apple,
Thou had’st not a twig of the aspen,
Under no obligation to the alder,
And hadst no friendship with the elm,
Thou wast the beloved of the fair.

Ficus—Nearly the same in most of the European languages. Greek: [Greugais]. Latin: ficus. Celtic: fige.

F. carica—Common fig-tree. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crann fìge<eng> or <gai>fìghis.


[TD 66]

“Ach fòghlumaibh cosamhlach do’n chrann fhìge.”<eng>
Learn a parable from the fig-tree.

Morus—Greek: [Greugais], moras. Latin: morus, a mulberry. Loudon, in his ‘Encyclopedia of Plants,’ says it is from the Celtic mòr, dark-coloured. There is no such Celtic root; it may be from the Sanskrit, murch, Scotch, mirk, darkness, obscurity; and the Greek name has also this meaning. The fruit being of a darkish red colour. Old Ger. and Danish: mur-ber.

M. nigra—Common mulberry. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crànn-maol-dhearc,<eng> tree of the mild aspect, or if <gai>dearc<eng> here be a berry, the mild-berry tree. <gai>Maol<eng> (Latin, mollis) has many significations. Bald, applied to monks without hair, as <gai>Maol Cholum,<eng> St Columba; <gai>Maol Iosa, Maol Brighid,<eng> St Bridget, &c. A promontory, cape, or knoll, as <gai>Maol Chinntìre,<eng> Mull of Cantyre. Malvern, <gai>maol,<eng> and <gai>bearna,<eng> a gap. To soften, by making it less bitter, as <gai>“dean maol é,”<eng> make it mild. Hence mulberry, mildberry (Canon Bourke).


AMENTIFERÆ AND CUPULIFERÆ.

Catkin-bearers—Gaelic: <gai>caitean,<eng> the blossom of osiers.

<gai>“’Nis treigidh coileach á ghucag
’S caitean brucach nan craobh.”<eng>—M‘DONALD.

Now the cock will forsake the buds
And the spotted catkins of the trees.

Quercus—Said in botanical works to be from the Celtic, quer, fine. There is no such word in any Celtic dialect, and even Pictet has failed, after expending two pages on it, to explain it.

Q. robur—(“Robur comes from the Celtic, ro, excelling, and bur, development”—CANON BOURKE). The oak. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>dair,<eng> genitive <gai>dàrach,<eng> sometimes written <gai>dàrag, dùr, drù.<eng> Sanskrit: dru, druma, druta, a tree, the tree; daru, a wood.

<gai>“Sàmhach’ us mòr a bha ’n triath,
Mar dharaig ’s i liath air Lùbar,
A chaill a dlu-dheug o shean
Le dealan glan nan spéur,
Tha ’h-aomadh thar srùth o shliabh,
A còinneach mar chiabh a fuaim.”<eng>—OSSIAN.

Silent and great was the prince
Like an oak-tree hoary on Lubar,
Stripped of its thick and aged boughs
By the keen lightning of the sky,
It bends across the stream from the hill,
Its moss sounds in the wind like hair.


[TD 67]

<gai>Om, omna,<eng> the oak (O’Reilly). “Cormac, King of Cashel, Ireland, A.D. 903, says of <gai>omna<eng> that it equals <gai>fuamna,<eng> sounds, or noises, because the winds resound when the branches of the oak resist its passage. According to Varro, it is from os, mouth, and men, mind, thinking—that is, telling out what one thinks is likely to come. Cicero agrees with this, ‘Osmen voces hominum’”—CANON BOURKE. Compare Latin: omen, a sign, a prognostication,—it being much used in the ceremonies of the Druids. <gai>Omna,<eng> a lance, or a spear, these implements being made from the wood of the oak. Greek: [Greugais], a spear, because made of wood or oak. <gai>Eitheach,<eng> oak, from <gai>eithim,<eng> to eat, an old form of <gai>ith.<eng> Latin: ed-ere, as “oak” is derived from ak (Old German) to eat (the acorn). The “oak” was called Quercus esculus by the Latins. <gai>Rail, railaidh,<eng> oak.

<gai>“Ni bhiodh achd, aon dhearc ar an ralaidh.”<eng>
There used to be only one acorn on the oak.

Canon Bourke thinks it is derived from <gai>ro,<eng> exceeding, and <gai>ail,<eng> growth; or <gai>ri,<eng> a king, and <gai>al<eng> or <gai>ail<eng>—that is, king of the growing plants. The Highlanders still call it <gai>righ na coille,<eng> king of the wood. The Spanish name roble seems to be cognate with robur.

Q. ilex—Holm-tree. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>craobh thuilm,<eng> genitive of <gai>tolm,<eng> a knoll, may here be only an alteration of “holm.” <gai>Darach sior-uàine,<eng> ever-green oak.

Q. suber—The cork-tree. Gaelic: <gai>crànn àirceain.<eng> Irish: <gai>crann àirc. Airc,<eng> a cork.

Fagus sylvatica—Beech. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>craobh fhaibhile.<eng> Welsh: ffawydd. Fai, from [Greugais], to eat. [Greugais], the beech-tree. This name was first applied to the oak, and as we have no Quercus esculus, the name Fagus is applied to the beech and not to the oak. <gai>Oruin<eng> (O’Reilly), see Thuja articulata. <gai>Beith na measa,<eng> the fruiting birch. <gai>Meas,<eng> a fruit, as of oak or beech—like “mess,” “munch.” French: manger, to eat.

F. sylvatica var. atrorubens—Black beech. Gaelic: <gai>faibhile dubh<eng> (Fergusson), black beech, from the sombre appearance of its branches. The “mast” of the beech was used as food, and was called <gai>bachar,<eng> from Latin, bacchar; Greek, [Greugais], a plant having a fragrant root. A name also given to Valeriana celtica (Sprengel), Celtic nard.

Carpinus—Celtic: car, wood; and pin, a head. It having been used to make the yokes of oxen.


[TD 68]

C. betulus—Hornbeam. Gaelic: <gai>leamhan bog,<eng> the soft elm. (See Ulmus campestris).

Corylus avellana—Hazel. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>càlltuinn, càlldainn, càllduinn, cailtin, colluinn.<eng> Welsh: callen. Cornish: colwiden. Perhaps from Armoric: call. Gaelic: <gai>coill.<eng> Irish: <gai>coill,<eng> a wood, a grove. New Year’s time is called in Gaelic, <gai>coill; “oidhche coille,”<eng> the first night of January, then the hazel is in bloom. The first night in the new year, when the wind blows from the west, they call <gai>dàir na coille,<eng> the night of the fecundation of trees (“Statistics,” par. Kirkmichael). In Celtic superstition the hazel was considered unlucky, and associated with loss or damage. The words <gai>càll, còl, collen,<eng> have also this signification; but if two nuts were found together (<gai>cnò chomhlaich<eng>), good luck was certain. The Bards, however, did not coincide with these ideas. By it they were inspired with poetic fancies. “They believed that there were fountains in which the principal rivers had their sources; over each fountain grew nine hazel trees, <gai>caill crinmon (crina,<eng> wise), which produced beautiful red nuts, which fell into the fountain, and floated on its surface, that the salmon of the river came up and swallowed the nuts. It was believed that the eating of the nuts caused the red spots on the salmon’s belly, and whoever took and ate one of these salmon was inspired with the sublimest poetical ideas. Hence the expressions, ‘the nuts of science,’ ‘the salmon of knowledge.’” O’Curry’s ‘Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish.’

The badge of Clan Colquhoun.

Alnus—Name derived from Celtic. <gai>Al,<eng> a growth; and <gai>lan,<eng> full. According to Pictet, it is from alka, Sanskrit for a tree.

A. glutinosa—Common alder. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>feàrn—feàrn,<eng> same origin as varâna (Sanskrit), a tree. Welsh: gwernen—gwern, a swamp. It grows best in swampy places, and beside streams and rivers. Many places have derived their names from this tree, <gai>Gleann Fearnaite. Fearnan,<eng> near Loch Tay; <gai>Fearn,<eng> Ross-shire, &c. <gai>Ruaim<eng> (O’Reilly) (<gai>ruadh,<eng> red), it dyes red. When peeled it is white, but it turns red in a short time. The bark boiled with copperas makes a beautiful black colour. The wood has the peculiarity of splitting best from the root, hence the saying

<gai>“Gach fiodh o’n bhàrr, ’s am feàrna o’n bhun.”<eng>
Every wood splits best from the top, but the alder from the root.

Betula alba—Birch. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>beatha.<eng> Welsh:


[TD 69]

bedu seemingly from <gai>beath.<eng> Greek: [Greugais]. Latin: vita, life. Also the name of the letter B in Celtic languages, corresponding to Hebrew Beth (meaning a house). Greek: Beta. Generally written <gai>beith.

“Sa bheith chubhraidh.”<eng>—OSSIAN.
In the fragrant birch.

The Highlanders formerly made many economical uses of this tree. Its bark (<gai>meilleag<eng>), they burned for light, and the smooth inner bark was used, before the invention of paper, for writing upon, and the wood for various purposes.

The badge of the Clan Buchanan.

B. verrucosa—Knotty birch. Gaelic: <gai>beatha carraigeach,<eng> the rugged birch; <gai>beatha dubh-chasach,<eng> the dark-stemmed birch.

B. pendula—Gaelic: <gai>beatha dubhach,<eng> the sorrowful birch (<gai>dubhach,<eng> dark, gloomy, sorrowful, mourning, frowning). In Rannoch and Breadalbane: <gai>Beatha cluasach,<eng> the many (drooping) ear birch. (Stuart.)

B. nana.—Dwarf birch. Gaelic: <gai>beatha beag<eng> (Fergusson), the small birch.

Castanea vesca—Common chestnut. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>chraobh geanm-chno.

“No na craobha geanm-chno cosmhuil r’a gheugaibh.”<eng>—EZEKIEL. xxxi. 8.
Nor the chestnut-tree like his branches.

<gai>Geanm<eng> or <gai>geann,<eng> natural love, pure love, such as exists between relatives,—the tree of chaste love, and <gai>cno,<eng> a nut. The Celts evidently credited this tree with the same virtues as the chaste tree, Vitex agnus castus (Greek, [Greugais]; and Latin, castus, chaste). Hence the Athenian matrons, in the sacred rites of Ceres, used to strew their couches with its leaves. Castanea is said to be derived from Castana, a town in Pontus, and that the tree is so called because of its abundance there. But the town Castana (Greek, [Greugais]) was probably so called on account of the virtues of its female population. If so, the English name chestnut would mean chaste-nut, as it is in the Gaelic. Welsh: castan (from Latin, caste), chastely, modestly. The chestnut-tree of Scripture is now supposed to be Platanus orientalis, the Chenar plane-tree.

[Æsculus hippocastanum—The horse-chestnut. Gaelic: <gai>geanm chno feadhaich<eng> (Fergusson). Belongs to the order Aceraceæ. Was introduced to Scotland in 1709.]


[TD 70]

Populus alba—Poplar. Gaelic: <gai>pobhuill.<eng> Irish: <gai>poibleag.<eng> German: pappel. Welsh and Armoric: pobl. Latin: populus. This name has an Asiatic origin, and became a common name to all Europe through the Aryan family from the East. (1) Pictet explains it thus: “Ce nom est sans doute une reduplication de la racine Sanskrit pul, magnum, altum.” Pul pul, great, great, or big, big, as in the Hebrew construction, very big. We still say in Gaelic <gai>mòr mòr,<eng> big, big, for very big. Pul pul is the Persian for poplar, and pullah for salix. This tree is quite common in Persia and Asia Minor, hence it was as well known there as in Europe. The name has become associated with populus, the people, by the fact that the streets of ancient Rome were decorated with rows of this tree, whence it was called Arbor populi. Again, it is asserted that the name is derived from the constant movement of the leaves, which are in perpetual motion, like the populace—“fickle, like the multitude, that are accursed.”

P. tremula—Aspen. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>critheann,<eng> trembling.

<gai>“Mar chritheach san t’ sìne.”—ULL.
Like an aspen in the blast.

With the slightest breeze the leaves tremble, the poetic belief being that the wood of the Cross was made from this tree, and that ever since the leaves cannot cease from trembling. <gai>Eadhadh.<eng> Welsh: aethnen [aethiad, smarting). The mulberry tree of Scripture is supposed to be the aspen (Balfour), and in Gaelic is rendered <gai>craobh nan smèur.<eng> (See Morus and Rubus fructicosus.)

<gai>“Agus an uair a chluineas tu fuim siubhail an mullach chraobh nan smèur, an sin gluaisidh tu thu féin.”—2 SAMUEL v. 24.

And when thou hearest a sound of marching on the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself.

The badge of Clan Fergusson.

Salix—According to Pictet, from Sanskrit, sâla, a tree.

“Il a passe au suale dans plusieurs langues
… Ces noms derivent de sâla.”

Gaelic and Irish: <gai>seileach, saileog, sal, suil.<eng> Cognate with Latin: salix. Fin.: salawa. Anglo-Saxon: salig, salh, from which


(1) See Canon Bourke’s work on ‘The Aryan Origin of the Gaelic Race and Language.’ London: Longman.


[TD 71]

sallow (white willow) is derived. Welsh: helyg, willow. (See S. viminalis.)

S. viminalis—Osier willow; cooper’s willow. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>fineamhain<eng> (from <gai>fin,<eng> vine; and <gai>muin,<eng> a neck), a long twig—a name also applied to the vine. (1) Vimen in Latin means also a pliant twig, a switch osier. One of the seven hills of Rome (Viminalis Collis) was so named from a willow copse that stood there; and Jupiter, who was worshipped among these willows, was called “Viminius;” and his priests, and those of Mars, were called Salii for the same reason. The worship was frequently of a sensual character, and thus the willow has become associated with lust, filthiness. Priapus was sarcastically called “Salacissimus Jupiter,” hence salax, lustful, salacious; and in Gaelic, <gai>salach<eng> (from <gai>sal<eng>); German, sal, polluted, defiled. The osier is also called <gai>bunsag, bun,<eng> a stump, a stock. <gai>Maothan,<eng> from <gai>maoth,<eng> smooth, tender. <gai>Gall sheileach,<eng> the foreign willow.

S. caprea, and S. aquatica—Common sallow. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>sùileag,<eng> probably the same as Irish, <gai>saileog<eng> (Anglo-Saxon, salig, sallow). <gai>Sùil<eng>—the old Irish name—(in Turkish su means water) in Irish and Gaelic, the eye, look, aspect, and sometimes tackle (Armstrong). The various species of willow were extensively used for tackle of every sort. Ropes, bridles, &c., were made from twisted willows. “In the Hebrides, where there is so great a scarcity of the tree kind, there is not a twig, even of the meanest willow, but what is turned by the inhabitants to some useful purpose.”—WALKER’S ‘Hebrides.’ And in Ireland to this day “gads,” or willow ropes, are made. <gai>Geal-sheileach<eng> (Armstrong), the white willow or sallow tree. Irish: <gai>crann sailigh fhrancaigh,<eng> the French willow.

S. babylonica—The Babylonian willow. Gaelic: <gai>seileach an t’ srutha (sruth,<eng> a brook, stream, or rivulet), the willow of the brook.

<gai>“Agus gabhaidh sibh dhuibh féin air a’ cheud là meas chraobh àluinn, agus seileach an t’ srutha.”<eng>—LEV. xxiii. 40.

And take unto yourselves on the first day fruit of lovely trees, and willows of the brook.


MYRICACEÆ.

Myrica gale—Bog myrtle, sweet myrtle, sweet gale. Gaelic: <gai>rideag.<eng> Irish: <gai>rideog, rileog<eng> (changing sound of d to l being


(1) <gai>“Finemhain fa m’ chomhair”<eng> (in Genesis)—a vine opposite to me.


[TD 72]

easier). <gai>Ròd<eng> or <gai>roid<eng> is the common name in the Highlands, perhaps from the Hebrew, [Eabhrais], rothem, a fragrant shrub. It is used for numerous purposes by the Highlanders, e.g., as a substitute for hops; for tanning; and from its supposed efficacy in destroying insects, beds were strewed with it, and even made of the twigs of gale, which is there called <gai>nodha.<eng> “And to this day it is employed by the Irish for the same purpose by those who know its efficacy. The <gai>rideog<eng> is boiled and the tea or juice drank by children to kill ‘the worms.’ I think children educated in our national schools should be taught to know these plants and their value.”—CANON BOURKE.

Badge of the Clan Campbell.


CONIFERÆ.

Pinus—French: le pin. German: pyn-baum. Italian: il pino. Spanish: el pino. Irish: <gai>pinn chrann.<eng> Gaelic: <gai>pin-chrann.<eng> Anglo-Saxon: pinu. All these forms of the same name are derived, according to Pictet, from the Sanskrit verb pîna, the past participle of pîta, to be fat, juicy. From pîna, comes Latin, pinus, and the Gaelic, <gai>pin.<eng>

P. sylvestris—Scotch pine, Scots fir. Gaelic: <gai>giùthas, giùbhas.

“Mar giùbhas a lùb an doinionn.”<eng>—OSSIAN.
Like a pine bent by the storm.

<gai>Giùthas,<eng> probably from the same root as picea, pitch pine. Sanskrit: pish, soft, juicy. Gaelic: <gai>giùbhas,<eng> a juicy tree,—from the abundance of pitch or resin its wood contains; <gai>Con<eng> or <gai>cona<eng> (O’Reilly), from Greek: [Greugais], konos, a cone, a pine. Hence <gai>conadh,<eng> fire-wood. Fir in English, from Greek, [Greugais], fire, because good for fire.

Badge of the Macgregors—Clan Alpin.

P. picea—Silver pine. Gaelic: <gai>giubhas geal<eng> (Fergusson), white pine. First planted at Inveraray Castle in 1682.

<gai>“Nuair theirgeadh giubhas Lochlainneach.”<eng>—M‘CODRUM.
When the spruce fir is done.

<gai>Lòchlannach,<eng> from <gai>loch,<eng> lake, and <gai>lann,<eng> a Germano-Celtic word meaning land—i.e., the lake-lander, a Scandinavian.


[TD 73]

<gai>“Giubhas glàn na Lòchlainn,
Fuaight’ le copar ruadh.”<eng>

Polished fir of Norway,
Bound with reddish copper.

P. larix—Larch. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>laireag.<eng> Scotch: larick. Latin: larix, from the Celtic, làr, fat, from the abundance of resin the wood contains. Welsh: larswydden, fat wood.

P. strobus—(Strobus, a name employed by Pliny for an eastern tree used in perfumery) Weymouth pine. Gaelic: <gai>giùthas Sasunnach<eng> (Fergusson), the English pine. It is not English, however; it is a North American tree, but was introduced from England to Dunkeld in 1725.

Cupressus—Cypress. Irish and Gaelic: <gai>cuphair,<eng> an alteration of Cyprus, where the tree is abundant.

C. sempervirens—Common cypress. Gaelic: <gai>craobh bhròin,<eng> the tree of sorrow. <gai>Bròn,<eng> grief, sorrow, weeping. <gai>Craobh uaine giùthais,<eng> the green fir-tree.

<gai>“Is cosmhuil mi ri crann uaine giuthais.”<eng>—HOSEA xiv. 8.
I am like a green fir-tree.

The fir-tree of Scripture (Hebrew berosh and beroth are translated fir-trees) most commentators agree is the cypress.

Thuja articulata—Thyine wood. Gaelic: <gai>fiodh-thine.

“Agus gach uile ghnè fhiodha thine.”<eng>—REV. xviii. 12.
And all kinds of thyine wood.

Alteration of thya, from [Greugais], to sacrifice. Another kind of pine, Hebrew, oren (Irish and Gaelic, <gai>oruin<eng>), is translated ash in Isaiah xliv. 14, and beech by O’Reilly.

Cedar—(So called from its firmness.) Hebrew: [Eabhrais], erez. Cedrus Libani, cedar of Lebanon. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crann sheudar,<eng> cedar-tree.

<gai>“Agus air uile sheudaraibh Lebanoin.”<eng>—ISAIAH ii. 13.
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon.

The cedar wood mentioned in Lev. xiv. 4, was probably Juniperus oxycedrus, which was a very fragrant wood, and furnished an oil that protects from decay—cedar oil ([Greugais]). “Carmina linenda cedro”—i.e., worthy of immortality.

<gai>“Agus fiodh sheudar, agus scàrlaid, agus hiosop.”<eng>
And cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.


[TD 74]

Juniperus—Said to be “from the Celtic jeneprus, which signifies rough or rude” (Loudon), a word not occurring in any Celtic vocabularies that I have consulted. It seems to be the Latinised form of the Celtic root iu, iubh, iur, yw (see Taxus). From the same root comes yew in English. Irish: <gai>iubhar-beinne<eng> (O’Reilly), the hill yew; <gai>iubhar-talamh,<eng> the ground yew; <gai>ubhar-chraige,<eng> the rock yew; all given as names for the juniper. Juniperus is mentioned by both Virgil and Pliny. Both the Greeks and Romans reluctantly admitted that they were indebted to the Celts for many of their useful sciences, and even their philosophy (see Diogenes Laertius), as they certainly were for their plant and geographical names.

J. communis—Juniper. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>aiteil, aitinn, aitiol.

“Ach chaidh e fèin astar làtha do’n fhasach agus thàinaig e agus shuidh e fuidh craobh aiteil.”<eng>—1 KINGS xix. 4.

And he went a day’s journey into the desert, and he sat under a juniper tree.

The juniper of Scripture, Genista monosperma, was a kind of broom. <gai>Aiteil,<eng> from <gai>ait.<eng> Welsh: aeth, a point, furze. Irish: <gai>aiteann,<eng> furze, from its pointed leaves. <gai>Bior leacain<eng> (in Arran), the pointed hill-side plant. <gai>Staoin<eng> (in the North Highlands), <gai>caoran staoin,<eng> juniper berries (<gai>staoin,<eng> a little drinking-cup).

The badge of Clans Murray, Ross, M‘Leod, and the Athole Highlanders.

J. sabina—Savin. Gaelic: <gai>samhan<eng> (Armstrong), alteration of “sabina” the “sabina herba” of Pliny. Common in Southern Europe, and frequently cultivated in gardens, and used medicinally as a stimulant, and in ointments, lotions, &c.

Taxus—According to Benfey is derived from the Sanskrit, taksh, to spread out, to cut a figure, to fashion. Persian tak. Greek: [Greugais], an arrow. Irish and Gaelic: <gai>tuagh,<eng> a bow made of the taxos or yew, now applied to the hatchet used in place of the old bow.

T. baccata—Common yew. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>iuthar, iubhar, iughar,<eng> from <gai>iùi.<eng> Greek: [Greugais], an arrow, or anything pointed. Arrows were poisoned with its juice; hence in old Gaelic it was called <gai>iogh,<eng> a severe pain, and <gai>ioghar<eng> (Greek, [Greugais], ichor) pus, matter. The yew was the wood from which ancient bows and arrows were made, and that it might be ready at hand, it was planted in every burial-ground.

In this same spot Chuchullin, is their dust,
And fresh the yew tree grows upon their grave.

Hence another form of the name <gai>eo,<eng> a grave. <gai>Sìnsior, sinnsior<eng> (O’Reilly), long standing, antiquity, ancestry. The yew is remarkable for its long life. The famous yew of Fortingall in Perthshire, which once had a circumference of 56½ feet, is supposed to be 3500 years old. <gai>Sineadhfeadha<eng> (O’Reilly), protracting, extending.

ENDOGENS.


ORCHIDACEÆ.

Orchis—Greek: [Greugais], a plant with roots in the shape of testicles. “Mirabilis est orchis herba, sive serapias, gemina radice testiculis simili”—PLINY.

O. maculata—The spotted orchis. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>ùrach bhallach,<eng> from <gai>ùr,<eng> fresh; <gai>ùrach,<eng> a bottle; <gai>uradh,<eng> apparel, and <gai>ballach,<eng> spotted.

O. mascula—Early orchis. Gaelic: <gai>moth-ùrach,<eng> from <gai>mòth,<eng> the male of any animal.

<gai>“Lointeann far an cinn
I’na moth’raichean.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE in ‘Ben Doran.’

Meadows where the early orchis grow.

Irish: <gai>magairlin meireach, (magairle,<eng> the testicles; <gai>meireach<eng> (Greek, meiro), joyful, glad). <gai>Clachan gadhair (gadhar<eng> a hound, <gai>clach,<eng> a stone). The name, <gai>cuigeal an losgain,<eng> the frog’s spindle, is applied to many of the orchis; and frequently the various names are given to both maculata and mascula.

O. conopsea—Fragrant orchis. Gaelic: <gai>lus tàghta,<eng> the chosen or select weed.

Ophrys—Greek: [Greugais] (Gaelic, <gai>abhra<eng>), the eyelash, to which the delicate fringe of the inner sepals may be well compared. “A plant with two leaves”—FREUND.


(1) Laing is not correct when, in attacking the genuineness of the poems of Ossian, he asserts that the yew, so often mentioned in these poems, is not indigenous. There are various places, such as Gleniur, Duniur, &c., that have been so named from time immemorial, which prove that the yew was abundant in these places at least many centuries ago.


[TD 76]

O. or Listera ovata—Tway blade. Gaelic: <gai>dà-dhuilleach,<eng> two-leaved; <gai>dà-bhileach,<eng> same meaning.

Epipactis latifolia—White helleborine. Gaelic: <gai>’elebor-geal.<eng> (1) A plant used formerly for making snuff. “The root of hellebor cut in small pieces, the pouder drawne vp into the nose causeth sneezing, and purgeth the brain from grosse and slimie humors”—GERARD, 1597. This is probably the plant referred to in “Morag,” when M‘Donald describes the buzzing in his head, for even his nose he had to stop with hellebore, since he parted from her endearments.

<gai>“Mo cheann tha làn do sheilleanaibh
O dheilich mi ri d’bhriodal
Mo shròn tha stoipt’ á dh-elebor.
Na deil, le teine dimbis.”<eng>


IRIDACEÆ.

Iris—Signifying, according to Plutarch, the “eye.” Canon Bourke maintains “it is derived from [Greugais], to settle. And as a name it was by the pagan priests applied to the imaginary messenger, sent by gods and goddesses to others of their class, to announce tidings of goodwill. At times they imagined her sent to mortals, as in Homer, to settle matters, or to say they were destined to be settled. Such was the duty of IRIS. Now amongst Jews and Christians, the rainbow was the harbinger of peace to man, hence it was called ‘Iris;’ and the circle of blue, grey, or variegated tints around the pupil of the eye is not unlike the rainbow—therefore this circlet was so called by optic scientists, simply because they had no other word; and botanists have, by comparison, applied it to the fleur-de-lis, because it is varied in hue, like the iris of the eye, or the rainbow. Iris does not and did not convey the idea of eye.”

I. pseudacorus—The yellow flag. Gaelic: <gai>bog-uisge—bog,<eng> soft, but here a corruption of <gai>bogha-uisge,<eng> the rainbow. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>seilisdear,<eng> often <gai>seileasdear,<eng> and <gai>siolastar.<eng> The termination, tar, dear, or astar, in these names, means one of a kind, having a settled form or position. One finds this ending common in names of plants—as, oleaster, cotoneaster, &c., like [Greugais] in Greek, <gai>“fear”<eng> in Gaelic. <gai>Seil<eng> (the first syllable), from <gai>sol,<eng> the sun; <gai>solus,<eng> light; <gai>sol<eng> and <gai>leus,<eng> i.e., lux, light. Greek: [Greugais], hence sēil, e and i to give a lengthened sound,


(1) See Helleborus viridis.


[TD 77]

as in Greek. <gai>Seileastar,<eng> therefore, means the plant of light—Fleur de luce. Other forms of the word occur. <gai>Siol<eng> instead of <gai>seil,<eng> as <gai>siolstrach; siol<eng> or <gai>sil,<eng> to distil, to drop—an alteration probably suggested by the medicinal use made of the roots of the plant, which were dried, and made into powder or snuff, to produce salivation by its action on the mucous membrane. <gai>“Feileastrom, feleastrom, feleastar.<eng> Here f is the affected or digammated form. When <gai>eleastar<eng> (another form of the word) lost the ‘s,’ then, for sound’s sake, it took the digammated form (f)eleastar. Strom (the last syllable) is a diminutive termination. <gai>Seilistear,<eng> diminutive form <gai>seilistrin,<eng> and corrupted into <gai>seilistrom”<eng>—BOURKE.

Crocus—Greek: [Greugais]. Much employed amongst the ancients for seasonings, essences, and for dyeing purposes.

C. Sativus / Colchicum autumnale—Saffron crocus, meadow saffron. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crò, cròdh, cròch—cròdh chorcar. (1)

“’Se labhair Fionn nan chrò-shnuaidh.”<eng>—CONN MAC DEARG.
Thus spake Fingal the saffron-hued.

<gai>“Spiocnard agus croch.”<eng>—DANA SHOLHIM, iv. 14.
Spikenard and saffron.

Saffron was much cultivated anciently for various purposes, but above all for dyeing. “The first habit worn by persons of distinction in the Hebrides was the <gai>lein croich,<eng> or saffron shirt, so called from its being dyed with saffron.”—WALKER. The Romans had their crocōta, and the Greeks [Greugais], a saffron-coloured court dress. Welsh: saffrwm, saffron, from the Arabic name, z’afarân, which indicates that the name of the plant is of Asiatic origin.


AMARYLLIDACEÆ.

Narcissus pseudo-narcissus/jonquilla—Daffodil. Gaelic: <gai>lus a chròm-chinn,<eng> the plant having a bent or drooping head.

Galanthus nivalis—Snowdrop. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>gealag lair,—gealag,<eng> white as milk; <gai>làr,<eng> the ground. Galanthus. Greek: [Greugais], milk, and [Greugais], a flower.

Aloe—Hebrew, [Eabhrais], ahaloth. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>aloe.

“Leis na h-uile chraobhaibh tuise, mirr agus aloe.”<eng>
With all trees of frankincense; myrrh, and aloes.—SONG OF SOLOMON, iv. 14.


(1) For <gai>corcur,<eng> see Lecanora tartarea.


[TD 78]

The aloe of Scripture (1) must not be confounded with the bitter herb well known in medicine.


LILIACEÆ.

Lilium—Greek: [Greugais]. From the Celtic: li, colour, hue. Welsh: lliu. Gaelic: <gai>li.

“A mhaise-mhna is ailidh li!”<eng>—FINGALIAN POEMS.
Thou fair-faced beauty.

“Lily seems to signify a flower in general.”—WEDGEWOOD. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>lilidh<eng> or <gai>lìli.<eng>

Convallaria majalis—Lily of the valley. Gaelic: <gai>lili nan lòn. Lili nan gleann.

“Air ghilead, mar lili nan lòintean.”<eng>—M‘DONALD.
White as the lily of the valley.

<gai>“Is ròs Sharon mise lili nan gleann.”<eng>—STUART.
I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the glen.

“The lily of Scripture was probably Lilium chalcedonicum.”—BALFOUR.

Allium—The derivation of this word is said to be from all (Celtic), hot, burning. There is no such word. The only word that resembles it in sound, and with that signification, is <gai>sgallta,<eng> burned, scalded; hence, perhaps, “scallion,” the English for a young onion. Latin: calor.

A. cepa (<gai>cep,<eng> Gaelic: <gai>ceap,<eng> a head)—The onion. Gaelic: <gai>uinnean.<eng> Irish: <gai>oinninn.<eng> Welsh: wynwyn. French: oignon. German: önjön. Latin: unio. Gaelic: <gai>siobaid, siobann.<eng> Welsh: sibol. Scotch: sybo. German: zwiebel, scallions or young onions. <gai>Cutharlan,<eng> a bulbous plant. In Lorne, and elsewhere along the W. Highlands, frequently called <gai>Srònamh<eng> (probably from <gai>Sròn<eng> and <gai>amh,<eng> raw in the nose, or pungent in the nose).

A. porrum (2)—Garden leek. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>leigis, leiceas, leicis.<eng> German: lauch, leek.

<gai>“Agus na leicis agus na h’uinneinean.”<eng>—NUMBERS, xi. 5.
And the leeks and the onions.

Irish: <gai>bugha<eng> (Shaw), leeks, fear. O’Clery, in his ‘Vocabulary,’ published A.D. 1643, describes it thus: <gai>“Bugh, i.e., luibh gorm nó glàs ris a samhailtean sùile bhios gorm no glàs.”<eng> That is, a blue or grey plant, to which the eye is compared if it be blue or


(1) Aquilaria agallochum.

(2) “Porrum” from the Celtic, pori, to eat, to graze, to browse.


[TD 79]

grey. The resemblance between a leek and the eye is not very apparent, as the following quotation shows:—

<gai>“Dhearca mar dhlaoi don bhugha,
Is a dha bhraoi cearta caol-dhubha.”<eng>—O’BRIEN.

His eyes like a bunch of leeks,
And his two eyebrows straight, dark, narrow.

Although Shaw gives the name to leek, probably the plant referred to is the harebell (see Scilla non-scripta). Irish: <gai>coindid, coinne, cainnen.<eng> Welsh: cenin (cen, a skin, peel, scales, given to onions, garlic, leeks).

<gai>“Do roidh, no do coindid, no do ablaibh.”<eng>
Thy gale, nor thy onions, nor thy apples.

<gai>Coindíd,<eng> though applied to leeks, onions, &c., means seasoning, condiments, Latin: condo.

A. ursinum—Wild garlic. From the Celtic. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>garleag.<eng> Welsh: garlleg, from <gai>gar, gairce,<eng> bitter, most bitter. <gai>Gairgean. Creamh<eng> (Welsh, craf), <gai>cream,<eng> to gnaw, chew. <gai>Lurachan,<eng> the flower of garlic.

<gai>“Le d’ lurachain chreamhach fhàson

Narthecium ossifragum—Bog asphodel. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>blioch, bliochan,<eng> from <gai>blioch,<eng> milk. Welsh: gwaew’ trenin, king’s lance.

<gai>”Nuair thigheadh am buaichaill a mach,
’Sa gabhadh e mu chùl a chrùidh
Mu’n cuairt do Bhad-nan-clach-glas,
A bhuail ’air m bu tric am bliochd.”<eng>—M‘LEOD.

When the cowherd comes forth,
And follows his cows
Around Bhad-nan-clach-glàs,
Often he is struck with the asphodel.

Scilla non-scripta—Bluebell; wild hyacinth. Gaelic: <gai>fuath mhuic,<eng> the pig’s fear or aversion, the bulbs being very obnoxious to swine. <gai>Brog na cubhaig,<eng> cuckoo’s shoe. Irish: <gai>buth a muc.<eng> Probably <gai>buth<eng> is the same as <gai>bugha<eng> (see Allium porrum), fear, the pig’s fear. M‘Lauchainn called it <gai>lili gucagach.

“Lili gucagach nan cluigean.”<eng>
The bell-flowered lily.

S. verna—Squill (and the Latin, scilla, from the Arabic, ăsgyl). Gaelic: <gai>lear uineann,<eng> the sea-onion. <gai>Lear,<eng> the sea, the surface of the sea.

Asparagus officinalis—Common asparagus. Gaelic: <gai>creamh mac-fiadh.<eng> Irish: <gai>creamh-mùic fiadh,<eng> wild boar’s leek or garlic. The same name is given to hart’s tongue fern. <gai>Aspàrag,<eng> from the generic name [Greugais], to tear, on account of the strong prickles with which some of the species are armed.

Ruscus—Latinised form of Celtic root <gai>rus,<eng> wood, husk; <gai>rusgach,<eng> holly. Welsh: rhysgiad, an over-growing. Also bruscus, from Celtic, <gai>brus, bruis,<eng> small branches, brushwood.

Irish: <gai>calg-bhrudhan<eng> (Shaw)—<gai>calg,<eng> a prickle, from its prickly leaves; and <gai>bruth, bruid,<eng> a thorn, anything pointed; <gai>brudhan,<eng> generally spelled <gai>brughan,<eng> a faggot. Or it may only be a corruption from <gai>brum,<eng> broom. <gai>Calg bhealaidh,<eng> the prickly broom. It was formerly used by butchers to clean their blocks, hence the English name “butchers’ broom.”


[TD 81]


NAIADACEÆ.

Potamogeton.—Greek: [Greugais], a river, and [Greugais], near.

P. natans—Broad-leaved pondweed. Gaelic: <gai>duiliasg na h’aibhne,<eng> the river leaf. Most of the species grow immersed in ponds and rivers, but flower above its surface. <gai>Liobhag,<eng> from <gai>liobh,<eng> smooth, polish, from the smooth pellucid texture of the leaves, their surface being destitute of down or hair of any kind. Irish: <gai>liachroda,—liach,<eng> a spoon, <gai>rod,<eng> a water-weed, sea-weed; <gai>liach-Brighide,<eng> Bridget’s spoon. Probably these names were also given to the other species of pondweeds (such as P. polygonifolius) as well as to P. natans.

Zostera marina—The sweet sea-grass. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>bilearach<eng> (in Argyle, <gai>bileanach<eng>), from <gai>bileag,<eng> a blade of grass. The sea-grass was much used for thatching purposes, and it was supposed to last longer than straw.


ALISMACEÆ.

Alisma,—Greek: [Greugais], an aquatic plant; said to be from a Celtic root, alis, water. If ever this was a Celtic vocable it has ceased to have this signification: in Welsh alis means the lowest point, hell.

A. Plantago—Water-plantain. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>cor-chopaig (cor<eng> or <gai>cora,<eng> a weir, a dam, and <gai>copag,<eng> a dock, or any large leaf of a plant). It grows in watery places. Welsh: llyren, a duct, a brink or shore.

Triglochin palustre—Arrow-grass. Gaelic: <gai>bàrr a’ mhilltich,—

“Bun na cìpe is bàrr a’ mhilltich.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

<gai>bàrr,<eng> top, and <gai>milltich<eng> (Irish), “good grass,” and <gai>milneach,<eng> a thorn or bodkin—hence the English name arrow-grass. Generic name from [Greugais], three, and [Greugais], a point, in allusion to the three angles of the capsule. Sheep and cattle are fond of this hardy species, which afford an early bite on the sides of the Highland mountains. <gai>Milltich<eng> is commonly used in the sense of “grassy;” <gai>maghanan millteach,<eng> verdant or grassy meadows.


LEMNACEÆ.

Lemna minor—Duckweed. Gaelic: (1) <gai>mac gun athair,<eng> son without a father. Irish: <gai>lus gan athair gan mhathair,<eng> fatherless motherless wort. A curious name, perhaps suggested by the


(1) <gai>Mac-gun-athair<eng> may have originally been <gai>meacan air,—meacan,<eng> a plant, <gai>air,<eng> gen. of <gai>àr,<eng> slow (hence the name of the river “Arar” in France, meaning the slow-flowing river,—“Arar dubitans qui suos cursos agat”—SENECA), the plant that grows in slow or sluggish water.


[TD 82]

root being suspended from its small egg-shaped leaf, and not affixed to the ground. <gai>Gran-lachan,—gran,<eng> seed, grain, and <gai>lach,<eng> a duck. The roundish leaves, and the fact that ducks are voraciously fond of feeding on them, have suggested this and the following names: <gai>Ròs lachain,<eng> the ducks’ rose or flower. Irish: <gai>abhran donog<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>abhran<eng> is the plural of <gai>abhra,<eng> an eyelid, and <gai>donog,<eng> a kind of fish, a young ling. The fish’s eyelids; more likely a corruption of <gai>aran tunnaig,<eng> duck’s bread or meat.

It was used by our Celtic ancestors as a cure for headaches and inflammations.


ARACEÆ.

Arum, formerly aron, probably from the ancient Celtic root ar, land, earth; hence Latin, aro, to plough, and Gaelic, <gai>aran,<eng> bread, sustenance. The roots of many of the species are used both for food and medicine.

A. maculatum—Wake-robin, lords and ladies. Gaelic: <gai>cluas chaoin,<eng> the soft ear (<gai>caoin,<eng> soft, smooth, gentle, &c., and <gai>cluas,<eng> ear). The ear-shaped spathe would probably suggest the name. <gai>Cuthaidh,<eng> from <gai>cuth,<eng> a head, a bulb—hence <gai>cutharlan,<eng> any bulbous-rooted plant. <gai>Cuthaidh<eng> means also wild, savage. <gai>Gachar<eng> and <gai>gaoicin cuthigh<eng> are given in O’Reilly’s Dictionary as names for the Arum, from <gai>cai,<eng> a cuckoo. Old English: cuckoo’s pint.


ORONTIACEÆ.

Acorus calamus—Sweet-flag. Gaelic: <gai>cuilc-mhilis,<eng> sweet-rush;

<gai>“Cuilc mhilis agus canal.”<eng>
Calamus and cinnamon.

<gai>cuilc,<eng> a reed, a cane. Greek: [Greugais], applied to reeds, bulrush canes, e.g., <gai>cuile na Léig,<eng> the reeds of Lego. <gai>Cobhan cuilc,<eng> an ark of bulrushes. <gai>Cuilc-chrann,<eng> cane; <gai>milis<eng> (Greek: [Greugais], a bee), sweet. Before the days of carpets, this plant is said to have supplied the “rushes” with which it was customary to strew the floors of houses, churches, and monasteries.


TYPHACEÆ.

Typha, from Greek, [Greugais], a marsh in which all the species naturally grow.

T. latifolia—Great reed-mace or cat’s-tail. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>bodan dubh,<eng> from <gai>bod,<eng> a tail, and <gai>dubh,<eng> large, or dark. <gai>Cuigeal nam bàn-sìth,<eng> the fairy-woman’s spindle. It is often, but incorrectly, called <gai>bog bhuine<eng> or bulrush (see Scirpus lacustris). The downy seeds were used for stuffing pillows, and the leaves for making


[TD 83]

mats, chair-bottoms, thatch, and sometimes straw hats or bonnets.

T. angustifolia—Lesser reed-mace or cat’s-tail. Irish: <gai>bodan<eng> (O’Reilly), dim. of <gai>bòd,<eng> a tail.

Sparganium.—Name in Greek denoting a little band, from the ribbon-like leaves.

S. ramosum—Branched bur-reed. Gaelic: <gai>righ seisg,<eng> the king’s sedge, from its being a large plant with sword-shaped leaves. <gai>Seisg mheirg<eng> (Stewart),—<gai>meirg,<eng> rust, a standard or banner.

S. simplex—Upright bur-reed. Gaelic: <gai>seisg madraidh.<eng> Armstrong gives this name to S. erectum, by which he doubtless means this plant. <gai>Seisg,<eng> sedge, and <gai>madradh,<eng> a dog, a mastiff. Name probably suggested by the plant being in perfection in the dog-days, the month of July, <gai>mìos Mhadrail.<eng>


JUNCACEÆ.

Juncus, from the Latin jungo, to join. The first ropes were made from rushes, and also floor covering. Ancient Gaelic: <gai>aoin,<eng> from <gai>aon,<eng> one. Latin: unus. Greek: [Greugais]. Ger.: ein.

<gai>“A dàth amar dhàth an aeil,
Coilcigh eturra agus aein.
Sída eturra is brat gorm,
Derg ór eturra is glan chorn.”<eng>

(From the description of the Lady Crehé’s house by Caeilté MacRonain, from the Books of Ballymote, a rare ancient poem.)

The colour [of her dún] is like the colour of lime:
Within it are couches and green rushes;
Within it are silks and blue mantles;
Within it are red gold and crystal cups.

J. conglomeratus—Common rush. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>luachar,<eng> a general name for all the rushes, meaning splendour, brightness; hence <gai>luachar,<eng> a lamp. Latin: lucerna. Sanscrit: lauchanan, from the root, lauch, light. The pith of this and the next species was commonly used to make rush-lights. The rushes were stripped of their outer green skin, all except one narrow stripe, and then they were drawn through melted grease and laid across a stool to set. “The title <gai>Luachra<eng> was given to the chief Druid and magician, considered by the pagan Irish as a deity, who opposed St Patrick at Tara in the presence of the king and the nobility, who composed the convention”—‘Life of St Patrick.’ <gai>Bròg braidhe<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>bròg,<eng> a shoe; but here it should be <gai>bròdh,<eng> straw; <gai>braidhe,<eng> a mountain, the mountain straw or stem.


[TD 84]

J. effusus—Soft rush. Gaelic: <gai>luachar bòg,<eng> soft rush. Irish: <gai>feath,<eng> a bog. It grows best in boggy places. <gai>Fead,<eng> which seems to be the same name, is given also to the bulrush. <gai>Fead,<eng> a whistle, a bustle.

<gai>“’S lìonmhor feadan caol,
Air an éirich gaoth.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

Doubtless suggested by the whistling of the wind among the rushes and reeds. The common rush and the soft rush were much used in ancient times as bed-stuffs; they served for strewing floors, making rough couches, &c.

J. articulatus—Jointed rush. Gaelic: <gai>lochan nan damh.<eng> This name is given by Lightfoot in his ‘Flora Scotica,’ but it should have been <gai>lachan nan damh. Lachan,<eng> a reed, the ox or the hart’s reed.

J. squarrosus—Heath-rush, stool-bent. Gaelic: <gai>bru-corcur<eng> (M‘Alpine),—<gai>bru-chorachd,<eng> the deers’ moor-grass; <gai>bru,<eng> a deer, a hind; <gai>corcach,<eng> a moor or marsh. See Scirpus.

<gai>“Bruchorachd ás cìob, (1)
Lusan am bi brìgh,” &c.<eng>
—M‘INTYRE in ‘Ben Doran.’

Heath-rush and “deer’s hair,”
Plants nutritious they are, &c.

Specimens of this plant have also been supplied with the Gaelic name <gai>moran<eng> labelled thereon, and in another instance <gai>muran.<eng> These names mean the plants with tapering roots; the same signification in the Welsh, moron, a carrot. (See <gai>Muirneach<eng>—Ammophila arenaria.)

J. maritimus and acutus—Sea-rush. Irish: <gai>meithan<eng> (O’Reilly). <gai>Meith,<eng> fat, corpulent. J. acutus (the great sea-rush) is the largest British species.

Luzula.—Name supposed to have been altered from Italian, lucciola, a glow-worm. It was called by the ancient botanists gramen luxulæ (Latin, lux, light).

L. sylvatica—Wood-rush. Gaelic: <gai>luachar còïlle,<eng> the bright grass or rush of the wood. The Italian name lucciola is said to be given from the sparkling appearance of the heads of flowers when wet with dew or rain. <gai>Learman<eng> (Stewart), possibly from <gai>lear<eng> or <gai>léir,<eng> clear, discernible; a very conspicuous plant, more of the habit of a grass than a rush, the stalk rising to the height of more that two feet, and bearing a terminal cluster of brownish flowers, with large light-yellow anthers.


(1) See Scirpus cæspitosus.


[TD 85]


CYPERACEÆ.

Schœnus (from [Greugais] or [Greugais], a cord in Greek).—From plants of this kind cords or ropes were made.

S. nigricans—Bog-rush. Gaelic: <gai>seimhean<eng> (Armstrong). Irish: <gai>seimhin (seimh,<eng> smooth, shining—the spikelets being smooth and shining; or which is more likely, from <gai>siobh<eng> or <gai>siobhag,<eng> straw,—hence <gai>sioman,<eng> a rope made of straw or rushes; the Greek name [Greugais] for the same reason).

Scirpus, sometimes written sirpus (Freund), seems to be cognate with the Celtic cirs, cors, a bog-plant; hence Welsh, corsfruyn, a bulrush (Gaelic, <gai>curcais<eng>). Many plants of this genus were likewise formerly used for making ropes. (Cords, Latin, chorda; Welsh, cord; Gaelic and Irish, <gai>corda;<eng> Spanish, cuerda,—all derived from cors.)

S. maritimus—Sea-scirpus. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>bròbh.<eng> Name from <gai>brò. brà,<eng> or <gai>bràdh,<eng> a quern, a hand-mill. The roots are large and very nutritious for cattle, and in times of scarcity were ground down in the <gai>muileann bràdh<eng> (French, moulin à bras), to make meal; <gai>bracan,<eng> broth,—hence <gai>bracha,<eng> malt, because prepared by manual labour (Greek, [Greugais]; Latin, brachium; Gaelic, <gai>braic;<eng> French, bras, the arm).

S. cæspitosus—Tufted scirpus, deer’s hair, heath club-rush. Gaelic: <gai>cìob, cìpe,<eng> and <gai>cìob cheann dubh (cìob<eng> = [Greugais]; Latin, cibus, food; <gai>ceann,<eng> head; <gai>dubh,<eng> black).

<gai>“Le’n cridheacha’ meara
Le bainne na cìoba.’<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

This is the principal food of cattle and sheep in the Highlands in March, and till the end of May. <gai>Cruach luachair,—cruach,<eng> a heap, a pile, a hill, and <gai>luachair,<eng> a rush.

The badge of the Clan M‘Kenzie.

S. lacustris—Bulrush, lake-scirpus. Gaelic: <gai>gobhal luachair,<eng> the forked rush (<gai>gobhal,<eng> a fork), from the forked or branched appearance of the cymes appearing from the top of tall, terete (or nearly so), leafless stems. When this tall stem is cut, it goes by the name of <gai>cuilc,<eng> (1) a cane, and is used to bottom chairs. Irish: <gai>gibiun,—gib<eng> or <gai>giob,<eng> rough, and <gai>aoin,<eng> a rush. Gaelic and Irish, <gai>bòg mhuine, boigean, bòg luachair, bòg,<eng> (2) a marsh, a fen, swampy ground, to bob, to wag,—names indicating its habitat,


(1) <gai>“Mu lochan nan cuilc a tha ruadh.”<eng>—TIGHMORA.

(2) <gai>Bòg<eng> and <gai>bòlg<eng> are frequently interchanged: <gai>bòlg luachair,<eng> prominent or massy rush; from <gai>bòlg,<eng> gen. <gai>builg,<eng> comes bul in bulrush.


[TD 86]

also its top-heavy appearance, causing it to have a bobbing or wagging motion. <gai>Curcais (curach,<eng> a marsh, a fen) is more a generic term, and equals scirpus. <gai>Min-fheur,<eng> a bulrush. (See Festuca ovina.)

Badge of Clan M‘Kay.

Eriophorum (from [Greugais], wool, and [Greugais], to bear).—Its seeds are covered with a woolly substance—hence it is called cotton-grass.

E. vaginatum and E. polystachyon—Cotton-sedge. Scotch: cat’s-tail. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>canach.<eng> Irish: <gai>cona<eng> (from <gai>can,<eng> white), from its hypogynous bristles forming dense tufts of white cottony down, making the plant very conspicuous in peaty bogs. The <gai>canach<eng> in its purity and whiteness formed the object of comparison in Gaelic poetry for purity, fair complexion, &c., especially in love-songs:—

<gai>“Do chneas mar an canach
Co cheanalta thlà.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

Thy skin white as the cotton-grass
So tender and gentle.

<gai>“Bu ghìle na’n canach a crùth.”<eng>—OSSIAN.
Her form was fairer than the down of Cana.

In Ossian the plant is also called <gai>caoin cheann (caoin,<eng> soft), the soft heads, fair heads.

<gai>“Ghlac mi’n caoin cheanna sa’ bheinn
’Siad ag aomadh mu shruthaibh thall
Fo charnaibh, bu dìomhaire gaoth.”<eng>—TIGHMORA.

I seized cotton-grasses on the hill,
As they waved by their secret streams,
In places sheltered from the wind.

This is only the plural form of the name <gai>canach—caineichean.

“Na caineichean àluinn an t-shléibh.”<eng>—M‘LEOD.

O’Reilly gives the name <gai>sgathog fìadhain<eng> to E. polystachyon,—<gai>sgath,<eng> a tail, and <gai>og<eng> (dim. termination), the little tail,—to distinguish it from vaginatum, which is larger. Scotch: cat’s-tail.

Badge of Clan Sutherland.

Carex (likely from Welsh, cors; Gaelic, <gai>càrr,<eng> a bog, a marsh, or fenny ground).—This numerous family of plants grows mostly in such situations. <gai>Seisg,<eng> sedge; <gai>gallsheilisdear,<eng> also <gai>seilisdear amh<eng> (for <gai>Seilisdear,<eng> see Iris),—<gai>amh,<eng> raw—the raw sedge. Welsh: hesg. <gai>Seasg,<eng> barren, unfruitful. Except C. rigida, they


[TD 87]

are scarcely touched by cattle. According to Dr Hooker, carex is derived from Greek, [Greugais], from the cutting foliage. The Sanscrit root is kar, to cut, shear, divide.

C. vulgaris, and many of the other large species—Common sedge. Gaelic: <gai>gainnisg<eng> (Stewart),—<gai>gainne,<eng> a sedge, reed, cane, arrow; and <gai>seasg.<eng>


GRAMINEÆ.

Agrostis alba—Fiorin-grass. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>fioran, feor-ine,<eng> or <gai>fior-than;<eng> derived from Gaelic: <gai>feur, feoir,<eng> grass, herbage, fodder. Latin: vireo, I grow green,—ver, spring; fænum, fodder—r and n being interchangeable. This name is applied in the dictionaries to the common couch-grass, because, like it, it retains a long time its vital power, and propagates itself by extending its roots.

Alopecurus—Foxtail-grass. Gaelic: <gai>fiteag,—fit,<eng> food, refreshment. Latin: vita.

A. geniculatus.—Gaelic: <gai>fiteag chàm,—

“A chuiseag dheireach’s an fhiteag cham.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

<gai>cam,<eng> bent, from the knee-like bend in the stalk. A valuable grass for hay and pasture.

Arundo Phragmites—Reed-grass. Gaelic: <gai>seasgan; seasg,<eng> a reed. <gai>Lachan,<eng> the common reed. Irish: <gai>cruisgiornach, cruisigh,<eng> music, song; from its stem reeds for pipes were manufactured. Welsh: cawn wellt, cane-grass; qwellt, grass.

Anthoxanthum odoratum—Sweet meadow-grass. Gaelic: <gai>mislean,<eng> from <gai>milis,<eng> sweet.

<gai>“’San canach mìn geal ’s mislean ann.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.
The soft white cotton-grass and the sweet grass are there.

<gai>Borrach (borradh,<eng> scent, smell).—In some places this name is given to the Nardus stricta, which see. This is the grass that gives the peculiar smell to meadow hay. Though common in meadows, it grows nearly to the top of the Grampians (3400 feet); hence the names are given as “a species of mountain grass” in some dictionaries.

Milium effusum—Millet-grass. Gaelic: <gai>mileid.<eng> Welsh: miled. The name derived from the true millet misapplied. Millet is translated in the Gaelic Bible <gai>meanbh pheasair,<eng> small peas (see Faba vulgaris).—Ezekiel iv. 9.

Phleum pratense—Timothy grass, cat’s-tail grass. Gaelic: <gai>bodan,<eng> a little tail; the same name for Typha angustifolia. “This


[TD 88]

grass was introduced from New York and Carolina in 1780 by Timothy Hanson.”—LOUDON. It seems to have been unknown in the Hebrides and the Highlands before that date; for Dr Walker (‘Rural Econ. Hebrides,’ ii. 27) says, “that it may be introduced into the Highlands with good effect.” Yet Lightfoot (1777) mentions it as “by the waysides, and in pastures, but not common.” <gai>Bodan<eng> is also applied to P. arenarium and P. alpinum.

Lepturus filiformis.—Gaelic: <gai>dur fheur fairge,<eng> sea hard grass. <gai>Dur,<eng> hard (Latin, durus); <gai>feur,<eng> grass; <gai>fairg,<eng> the sea, ocean, wave. It grows all round Ireland, as well as in England and South Scotland. Irish: <gai>durfher fairge<eng> (O’Reilly).

Calamagrostis.—Etym. [Greugais], and [Greugais], reed-grass.

C. Epigejos—Wood small reed. <gai>Cuilc fheur,<eng> cane-grass; <gai>gainne<eng> = cane. <gai>Lachan coille,<eng> wood-rush.

Ammophila arenaria (or Psamma arenaria)—Sea-maram; sea-matweed. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>muirineach,<eng> from <gai>muir<eng> (Latin mare, the sea), the ocean. It is extensively propagated to bind the sand on the sea shore; generally called <gai>mùran<eng> on west coast. The same name is applied to the carrot, an alteration of <gai>mòron<eng>—a plant with large tapering roots. M‘Intyre alludes to <gai>“mùran brìghar,”<eng> but whether he refers to the carrot or to this grass is a matter of controversy. Not being a seaside Highlander, he was more likely to know the carrot, wild and cultivated, far better than this seaside grass, and associating it with groundsel (a plant which usually grows rather too abundantly, wherever carrots are sown), makes it a certainty that he had not the “sea-maram” in his mind. (See Daucus carota.)

Avena sativa—Oats. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>coirc.<eng> Welsh: ceirch. Armoric: querch. Probably from the Sanskrit karç, to crush.

<gai>“Is fhearr sìol caol coirce fhaotuinn a droch fhearann na’ bhi falamh.”<eng>
Better small oats than nothing out of bad land.

The small variety, A. nuda, the naked or hill oat, when ripe, drops the grain from the husk; it was therefore more generally cultivated two centuries ago. It was made into meal by drying it on the hearth, and bruising it in a stone-mortar, the <gai>“muilleann bràdh”<eng>—hand-mill or quern. Many of them may still be seen about Highland and Irish cottages.

A. fatua and pratensis—Wild oats. Gaelic: <gai>coirc fiadhain,<eng> wild oats; <gai>coirc dubh,<eng> black oats. Also applied to the Brome grasses.

[TD 89]

<gai>“Do’n t-siol chruithneachd, chuireadh gu tiugh;
Cha b’ e’ n fhiteag, no’ n coirc dubh.”<eng>—M‘DONALD.

When oats become black with blight, the name <gai>coirc dubh<eng> is applied, but especially to the variety called <gai>Avena strigosa.<eng>

Hordeum distichon—Barley; the kind which is in common cultivation. (“Barley” comes from Celtic bàr, bread, now obsolete in Gaelic, but still retained in Welsh—hence barn, and by the change of the vowel, beer.) Gaelic and Irish: <gai>eòrna, òrna.<eng> Irish: <gai>earn<eng> (perhaps from Latin, horrco, to bristle; Gaelic, <gai>òr,<eng> a beard)—O’Reilly. “The bearded or bristly barley;” <gai>“òrog,”<eng> a sheaf of corn. Hordeum, sometimes written ordeum (Freund), is from the same root. “It was cultivated by the Romans for horses, and also for the army; and gladiators in training were fed with it, and hence called hordiarii.” It is still used largely in the Highlands for bread, but was formerly made into “crowdie,” properly corrody, from Low Latin, corrodium, a worry.

<gai>“Fuarag èorn ann’ sàil mo bhroge,
Biadh a b’ fhearr a fhuir mi riamh.”<eng>

Barley-crowdie in my shoe,
The sweetest food I ever knew.

Irish: <gai>caineog,<eng> oats and barley—from <gai>cain<eng> (Greek, [Greugais]; Latin, census), rent, tribute. Rents were frequently paid in “kind,” instead of in money.

Secale cereale—Common rye. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>seagall.<eng> Greek: [Greugais]. Armoric: segal. French: seigle.

<gai>“An cruithneach agus an seagall.”<eng>—EXODUS.
The wheat and the rye.

Welsh: rhyg, rye.

Molinia cærulea—Purple melic-grass. Gaelic: <gai>bunglàs<eng> (M‘Donald), <gai>punglàs. (Bun,<eng> a root, a stack; <gai>glàs,<eng> blue.) The fishermen round the west coast and in Skye make ropes for their nets of this grass, which they find by experience will bear the water well without rotting. Irish: <gai>mealoigfér corcuir<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>mealoig = melic<eng> (from <gai>mel<eng>, honey), the pith is like honey; <gai>fèr<eng> or <gai>fèur,<eng> grass; <gai>corcuir,<eng> crimson or purplish. In some parts of the Highlands the plant is called <gai>braban<eng> (Stewart.)

Glyceria.—From Greek, [Greugais], sweet, in allusion to the foliage.

G. fluitans—Floating sweet grass. <gai>Milsean uisge, millteach uisge,<eng>—perhaps from <gai>millse,<eng> sweetness. Horses, cattle, and swine are fond of this grass, which only grows in watery places.


[TD 90]

Trout (Salmo fario) eat the seeds greedily. The name <gai>millteach<eng> is frequently applied to grass generally as well as to Triglochin palustre (which see). <gai>Feur uisge,<eng> water-grass.

Briza.—Quaking-grass. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>conan,—conan,<eng> a hound, a hero, a rabbit,—may possibly be named after the celebrated <gai>“Conan Maol,”<eng> who was known among the Feine for his thoughtless impetuosity. He is called <gai>“Aimlisg na Fèinne”<eng> the mischief of the Fenians. This grass is also called <gai>feur gortach,<eng> hungry, starving grass. “A weakness, the result of sudden hunger, said to come on persons during a long journey or in particular places, in consequence of treading on the fairy grass”—(Irish Superstitions). <gai>Féur sìthein sìthe,<eng>—literally, a blast of wind; a phantom, a fairy. The oldest authority in which this word <gai>sìthe<eng> occurs is Tirechan’s ‘Annotations on the Life of St Patrick,’ in the Book of Armagh, and is translated “Dei terreni,” or gods of the earth. <gai>Crìth fhèur,<eng> quaking-grass. <gai>Grigleann<eng> (in Breadalbane), that which is in a cluster, a festoon; the Gaelic name given to the constellation Pleïades.

Cynosurus.—Etym. [Greugais], a dog, and [Greugais], a tail.

C. cristatus—Crested dog’s-tail. Gaelic: <gai>goinear,<eng> or <gai>goin fheur,<eng> and sometimes <gai>conan<eng> (from <gai>coin,<eng> dogs, and <gai>feur,<eng> grass). Irish: <gai>fèur choinein,<eng> dog’s grass.

Festuca.—Gaelic: <gai>féisd.<eng> Irish: <gai>féiste.<eng> Latin: fastus and festus. French: feste, now fête. English: feast, as applied to grass, good pasture, or food for cattle.

F. ovina—Sheep’s fescue-grass. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>feur chaorach.

“Mìn-fheur chaorach.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.
Soft sheep grass.

This grass has fine sweet foliage, well adapted for feeding sheep and for producing good mutton—hence the name. But Sir H. Davy has proved it to be less nutritious than was formerly supposed. <gai>Mìn-fheur<eng> (Armstrong), is applied to any soft grass—as Holcus mollis—to a flag, a bulrush; as <gai>“mìn-fheur gun uisge,”<eng> a bulrush without water (in Job).

Triticum, according to Varro, was so named from the grain being originally ground down. Latin: tritus, occurring only in the ablative (tero). Greek: [Greugais], to rub, bruise, grind.

T. æstivum (and other varieties)—Wheat. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>cruithneachd—cruineachd.<eng> This name seems to be associated with the Cruithne, a tribe or tribes who, according to tradition, came from Lochlan to Erin, and from thence to Alban, where


[TD 91]

they founded a kingdom which lasted down till the seventh century. Another old name for wheat—<gai>breothan,<eng> may similarly be connected with another ancient tribe, <gai>“Clanna Breogan.<eng> They occupied the territory where Ptolemy in the second century places an offshoot of British Brigantes.”—SKENE. Were these tribes so called in consequence of cultivating and using wheat? or was it so called from those tribal names? are questions that are difficult to answer. It seems at least probable that they were among the first cultivators of wheat in Britain and Ireland. <gai>Breothan,<eng> that which is bruised; the same in meaning as triticum. Other forms occur, as <gai>brachtan,<eng> (1) being bruised or ground by hand in the <gai>“muileann bràdh”<eng> the quern; sometimes spelled <gai>breachtan. Mann,<eng> wheat, food. <gai>Fiormann,—fior,<eng> genuine, and <gai>mann,<eng> a name given to a variety called French wheat. <gai>Tuireann,<eng> perhaps from <gai>tuire,<eng> good, excellent. The flour of wheat is universally allowed to make the best bread in the world. <gai>Romhan,<eng> Roman or French wheat; “branks.”

T. repens—Couch, twitch. Scotch: dog-grass, quickens, &c. Gaelic: <gai>feur a’-phuint<eng> (M‘Kenzie), the grass with points or articulations. Every joint of the root, however small, having the principle of life in it, and throwing out shoots when left in the ground, causing great annoyance to farmers. (From the root <gai>punc<eng> or <gai>pung;<eng> Latin, punctum, a point.) <gai>Goin-fheur,<eng> dogs-grass; or <gai>goin,<eng> a wound, hurt, twitch. According to Rev. Mr Stewart, Nether Lochaber, this name is also given to Cynosurus. <gai>Fiothran,<eng> the detestable. It is one of the worst weeds in arable lands on account of the propagating power of the roots. <gai>Bruim fheur,<eng> flatulent grass. Probably only a term of contempt.

T. junceum—Sea-wheat grass. Gaelic: <gai>glàs fheur,<eng> the pale green grass; a seaside grass. It helps, with other species, to bind the sand.

Lolium perenne and temulentum—Darnell, rye-grass. Gaelic: <gai>breoillean.<eng> Irish: <gai>breallan (breall<eng> or <gai>breallach,<eng> knotty), from the knotty appearances of the spikes, or from its medicinal virtues in curing glandular diseases. “And being used with quick brimstone and vinegar it dissolveth knots and kernels,


(1) Latin: brace or brance. Gallic, of a particularly white kind of corn. According to Hardouin, blé blanc Dauphiné, Triticum Hibernum, Linn., var. Granis albis. Lat., sandala.

“Galliæ quoque suum genus farris dedere: quod illie brance vocant apud nos sandalum nitidissimi grani.”—PLINY, 18, 7.


[TD 92]

and breaketh those that are hard to be dissolved”—CULPEPPER. <gai>Dìthean,<eng> darnel; perhaps from <gai>dìth,<eng> want, poverty. It may be so named from its growing on poor sterile soil, which it is said to improve. “They have lately sown ray-grass to improve cold, clayey soil”—Dr PLATT, 1677. <gai>Roille.<eng> Irish: <gai>raidhleadh,<eng> from <gai>raidhe,<eng> a ray—hence the old English name ray-grass. French: ivraie, darnel. Welsh: efr—perhaps alterations of the French ivre, drunk. The seeds of darnel, when mixed with meal, cause intoxication, and are believed to produce vertigo in sheep—the disease that maketh them reel; and for this reason the grass is often called <gai>sturdan,<eng> from <gai>sturd,<eng>—hence Scotch sturdy grass. <gai>Siobhach,<eng> from <gai>siobhas,<eng> rage, fury, madness. “It is a malicious plant of sullen Saturn: as it is not without some vices, so it hath also many virtues”—CULPEPPER. <gai>Cuiseach<eng> (M‘Alpine), rye-grass. <gai>Ruintealas<eng> (O’Reilly), the loosening, aperient, or purgative grass—from <gai>ruinnec,<eng> grass, and <gai>tealach,<eng> loosening.

Nardus stricta—Mat-grass, moor-grass. Gaelic: <gai>beitean<eng> (perhaps from <gai>beithe<eng>), was refused. Cattle refuse to eat it. It remains in consequence in dense tufts, till it is scorched by early frosts. In this condition it is frequently burned, in order to destroy it. <gai>Borrach<eng> (in some places), parching. <gai>Carran<eng> (Stewart), a name given also to Spergula arvensis. To this grass and other rough species, as rushes, sedges, &c., the name <gai>riasg<eng> is given.

<gai>“Cuiseagan-a’s riasg
Chinneas air an t’sliabh.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

Aira flexuosa—Waved hair-grass. Gaelic: <gai>mòin-fheur,<eng> peat-grass. It grows generally in peaty soil.


CRYPTOGAMIA.


FILICES.

Filices—Ferns. Gaelic: <gai>raineach, roineach.<eng> Irish: <gai>raith, raithne, raithneach;<eng> also, <gai>reathnach.<eng> Welsh: rhedyn. Perhaps formed from <gai>reath,<eng> a revolution or turning about, or <gai>rat,<eng> motion, from the circinate evolution of the young fronds—an essential characteristic of ferns.

Polypodium vulgare—<gai>Cloch-reathneach<eng> (Armstrong), the stone-fern; <gai>cloch,<eng> a stone. It is common on stone-walls, stones, and old stems of trees. <gai>Ceis-chrànn.<eng> Irish: <gai>céis chrainn,—cis,<eng> a tax, tribute, and <gai>crànn,<eng> a tree, because it draws the substance from the trees; or from the crosier-like development of the fronds, like a shepherd’s crook, <gai>“cis-cean.” Sgèamh na cloch.


[TD 93]

Sgeamh<eng> means reproach, and <gai>sgiamh<eng> or <gai>sgèimh,<eng> beauty, ornament; <gai>“na cloch”<eng> of the stones. The second idea seems, at least in modern times, to be more appropriate than the first, especially as the term was applied to the really beautiful oak-fern.

<gai>“Mu chinneas luibhean ’us an sgèimh.”<eng>
How the flowers and the ferns grow.

<gai>Reidh raineach,—reidh,<eng> smooth, plain. <gai>Raineach nan crag,<eng> the rock-fern. <gai>Mearlag<eng> (in Lochaber), perhaps from <gai>meàr<eng> or <gai>meùr,<eng> a finger, from a fancied resemblance of the pinnules to fingers.

P. Dryopteris—Oak-fern. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>sgeamh dharaich<eng> (O’Reilly), the oak-fern. No Gaelic name is recorded for the beech-fern (P. Phegopteris).

Blechnum spicant—Hard fern. The only Gaelic name supplied for this fern is <gai>“an raineach chruaidh,”<eng> hard fern. It is impossible to say whether this is a translation or not. Being a conspicuous and well-defined fern, it must have had a Gaelic name.

Cystopteris fragilis—Bladder-fern. Gaelic: <gai>friodh raineach,<eng> or <gai>frioth fhraineach,—“frioth,”<eng> small, slender. The tufts are usually under a foot long; stalks very slender.

Polystichum aculeatum, lobatum, and angulare—Gaelic: <gai>ibhig<eng> (Rev. A. Stewart), the name by which the shield-ferns are known in the West Highlands. This name may have reference to the medicinal drinks formerly made from the powdered roots being taken in water as a specific for worms (see L. filix-mas), from <gai>ibh,<eng> a drink. French: ivre. Latin: ebrius.

P. Lonchitis—Holly fern. Gaelic: <gai>raineach-chuilinn<eng> (Stewart), holly fern, known by that name in Lorne; also <gai>còlg raineach,<eng> in Breadalbane and elsewhere. For <gai>cuileann<eng> and <gai>còlg,<eng> see Ilex aquifolium.

Lastrea Oreopteris—Sweet mountain fern. Gaelic: <gai>crim-raineach<eng> (Stewart). Most likely from <gai>creim,<eng> a scar, the stalks being covered with brown scarious scales. In some places the name <gai>fàile raineach<eng> is given, from <gai>fàile,<eng> a scent, a smell. This species may be easily distinguished by the minute glandular dots on the under side of the fronds, from which a fragrant smell is imparted when the plant is bruised.

L. filix-mas—Male fern. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>marc-raineach,<eng> horse-fern. <gai>Marc.<eng> Welsh: march. Old High German: marah,


[TD 94]

a horse. This fern has been celebrated from time immemorial as a specific for worms; the powdered roots, taken in water, were considered an excellent remedy. Irish: <gai>raineach-madra,<eng> dog-fern.

L. spinulosa, and the allied species dilatata and Fœnisecii, are known by the name <gai>raineach nan rodainn,<eng> from Latin, rodo. Sanscrit: rad, to break up, split, gnaw,—the rat’s fern, in Morven, Mull, and Lewis. “Dr Hooker is mistaken as to the range of this fern, as it is extremely abundant here, at least in the form of dilatata”—(Lewis Correspondent). (1) The name rat’s fern, from its commonness in holes, and the haunts of rats.

Athyrium filix-fæmina—Lady-fern. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>raineach Mhuire,<eng> Mary’s fern,—<gai>Muire,<eng> the Virgin Mary, Our Lady; frequently occurring in plant-names in all Christian countries.

Asplenium.—From Greek: [Greugais], privative, and [Greugais], the spleen.

A. Trichomanes—Black spleenwort. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>dùbh chàsach,<eng> dark-stemmed. <gai>Lus na seilg,<eng> from <gai>sealg,<eng> the spleen. This plant was formerly held to be a sovereign remedy for all diseases of this organ, and to be so powerful as even to destroy it if employed in excess. <gai>Lus a chorrain. Ùrthàlmhan<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>ùr,<eng> green, and <gai>talamh,<eng> the earth. As <gai>dùbh chàsach<eng> is the common name for Trichomanes—probably <gai>ùr thalmhan<eng> was applied to A. viride. <gai>Failtean fionn,<eng> see A. capillus-Veneris.

A. Ruta-muraria—Rue fern. Gaelic: <gai>rue bhallaidh,<eng> wall-rue.

A. Adiantum-nigrum—Gaelic: <gai>an raineach uàine,<eng> the green fern. Irish: <gai>craobh mac fiadh<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>craobh,<eng> a tree, a plant, and <gai>muc fiadh,<eng> wild pig or boar.

Scolopendrium vulgare—Hart’s-tongue fern. Gaelic: <gai>creamh mac fiadh,<eng> or in Irish, <gai>creamh nam muc fiadh.<eng> Wild boar’s wort, a name also given to Asparagus.

Pteris aquilina—Common brake. Gaelic: <gai>an raineach mhòr,<eng> the large fern. <gai>Raith<eng> (see Polypodium). The brake is used for various purposes by the Gaels, such as for thatching cottages;


(1) My well-informed correspondent also remarks: “I may mention one or two other plants, regarding which Dr Hooker’s information is slightly out. His Salix repens is very common here and in Caithness, though absent in at least some parts further south. Utricularia minor can easily be found in quantities near the Butt of Lewis; and Scutellaria minor, which he allows no further than Dumbarton, grows equally far north, although all I am aware of could be covered by a table-cloth. Another interesting plant, Eryngium maritimum, grows in a single sandy bay on our west coast.”


[TD 95]

and beds were also made of it. It is esteemed a good remedy for rickets in children, and for curing worms.

Adiantum capillus-Veneris—Maiden-hair fern. Gaelic: <gai>failtean fiònn<eng> (Armstrong), from <gai>falt,<eng> hair, and <gai>fiònn,<eng> fair, resplendent. This fern is only known in the Highlands by cultivation. This name is frequently given to Trichomanes (<gai>dùbh chàsach<eng>) improperly.

Ophioglossum—From Greek: [Greugais], a serpent, and [Greugais], a tongue. The little fertile stalk springing straight out of the grass may not inaptly be compared to a snake’s tongue.

O. vulgatum—Adder’s tongue. <gai>Lus na nathraith<eng> (M‘Kenzie), the serpent’s weed. <gai>Teanga a’ nathrach,<eng> the adder’s tongue. Welsh: tafad y neidr, adder’s tongue. In the Western Highlands, <gai>beasan<eng> or <gai>feasan<eng> (Stewart).

Osmunda—Osmunder, in Northern mythology, was one of the sons of Thor (Gaelic: <gai>Tordan,<eng> the thunderer, the Jove of the Celts; os in Celtic, over, above, upon, and <gai>munata,<eng> a champion, in Irish),—said to have received the name on account of its potential qualities in medicine.

O. regalis—Royal fern. Gaelic: <gai>raineach rioghail,<eng> kingly fern; <gai>righ raineach,<eng> royal fern. In Ireland it is called bog-onion.

Botrychium lunaria—Moonwort. Gaelic: <gai>luan lus,<eng> moonwort. Welsh: y lleûadlys,—lleuad, moon. <gai>“Luan,<eng> the moon, seems a contraction of <gai>luath-an,<eng> the swift planet”—ARMSTRONG. But rather from Sanscrit: luach, light. Latin: luna. French: lune. <gai>Déur lus<eng> and <gai>dealt lus<eng> (Stewart),—<gai>déur,<eng> a tear, a drop of any fluid, and <gai>dealt,<eng> dew. This plant was held in superstitious reverence among Celtic and other nations. Horses were said to lose their shoes where it grew. “On Sliabh Riabhach Mountain no horse can keep its shoes; and to this day it is said that on Lord Dunsany’s Irish property there is a field where it is supposed all live stock lose their nails if pastured there.” “A Limerick story refers to a man in Clonmel jail who could open all the locks by means of this plant.” The same old superstition still lingers in the Highlands—

There is an herb, some say whose virtue’s such
It in the pasture, only with a touch,
Unshoes the new-shod steed.

“On White-Down, in Devonshire, near Tiverton, there was found thirty horse-shoes pulled off from the feet of the Earl of Essex, his horses being there drawn up into a body, many of


[TD 96]

them being but newly shod, and no reason known, which caused much admiration; and the herb described usually grows upon heaths.”—CULPEPPER.

Ferns frequently formed components in charms.

<gai>“Faigh naoi gasan rainaich
Air an gearradh, le tuaigh,
A’s tri chnaimhean seann-duine
Air an tarruinn à uaigh,”<eng> &c.—M‘INTYRE.

Get nine branches of ferns
Cut with an axe,
And three old man’s bones
Pulled from the grave.

“Fern seeds were looked upon as magical, and must be gathered on Midsummer eve.”—Scottish and Irish Superstition.


LYCOPODIACEÆ.

Lycopodium, from [Greugais], a wolf, and [Greugais], a foot, from a fancied resemblance to a wolf’s foot.

L. Selago—Fir club-moss. Gaelic: <gai>garbhag an sleibhe,<eng> the rough one of the hill. “The Highlanders make use of this plant instead of alum to fix the colours in dying. They also take an infusion of it as an emetic and cathartic; but it operates violently, and, unless taken in a small dose, brings on giddiness and convulsions.”—LIGHTFOOT. According to De Thèis, “Selago” is derived from the Celtic, sel (<gai>sealladh<eng>), sight, and jach (<gai>ìoc<eng>). Greek: [Greugais], a remedy, being useful for complaints in the eyes.

Badge of Clan M‘Rae.

L. clavatum, annotinum, and the rest of this family are called <gai>lus bhalgaire,<eng> the fox-weed.


EQUISETACEÆ.

Equisetum, from equus, a horse, and seta, hair, in allusion to the fine hair-like branches of the species. Those plants of this order growing in watery places are called in Gaelic and Irish, <gai>clois, clò-uisge,<eng> the names given to fluviatile, palustre, ramosum; and those flourishing in drier places, <gai>earbuill-each,<eng> horse-tail. <gai>Clois<eng> seems a contraction of <gai>clò-uisge<eng> (O’Reilly),—<gai>clò,<eng> a nail-pen or peg, perhaps suggested by the appearance of the fruiting stems, and <gai>uisge,<eng> water.

E. hyemale—Dutch rushes, shave-grass. Gaelic: <gai>a bhiorag,—bìor,<eng> a pointed small stick, anything sharp or prickly. Or water (see Appendix). This species was at one time extensively


[TD 97]

used for polishing wood and metal, a quality arising from the cuticle abounding in siliceous cells—hence the use made of the plant for scouring pewter and wooden things in the kitchen. A large quantity used to be imported from Holland, hence the name “Dutch rushes.” Irish: <gai>gadhar,<eng> from <gai>gad,<eng> a withe, a twig. <gai>Liobhag,<eng> from <gai>liobh,<eng> smooth, polish. It grows in marshy places and standing water. <gai>Cuiridin<eng> (O’Reilly), because growing on marshy ground.


BRYACEÆ.

Gaelic and Irish: <gai>coinneach, caoineach,<eng> from <gai>caoin,<eng> soft, lowly, &c. The principal economic use of moss to the ancient Gaels was in making bed-stuffs, just as the Laplanders use it to this day.

<gai>“Trì coilceadha na Feinne, bàrr gheal chrann, coinneach, ’us ùr luachair.”<eng>
The three Fenian bed-stuffs—fresh tree-tops, moss, and fresh rushes.

Welsh: mwswg, moss. 

Sphagnum—Bog-moss. Gaelic: <gai>mointeach liath (moin,<eng> peat, and <gai>liath,<eng> grey). From its roots and decayed stalks peat is formed. <gai>Fionnlach,<eng> from <gai>fiònn,<eng>, white. It covers wide patches of bog, and when full grown it is sometimes almost white; occasionally the plant has a reddish hue (<gai>coinneach dhearg,<eng> red moss). Martin refers to it in his ‘Western Islands:’ “When they are in any way fatigued by travel or otherways, they fail not to bathe their feet in warm water wherein red moss has been boiled, and rub them with it on going to bed.” This seems to be the only moss having a specific name in Gaelic, the rest going by the generic term <gai>còinneach.

“Còinich uine mu ’n iomall,
A’s imadach seòrsa.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

Green moss around the edges,
Many are the kinds.


MARCHANTIACEÆ AND LICHENES.

Marchantia polymorpha—Liverwort. Gaelic: <gai>lus an àinean,<eng> the liverwort. Irish: <gai>cùisle aibheach.<eng> Welsh: llysiar afu—afu, the liver. (Names derived from its medicinal effects on the liver.) Irish: <gai>duilleog na crùithneachta,<eng> the leaf of (many) shapes or forms. <gai>Crùth,<eng> form, shape, synonymous with Greek “polymorpha.”

Peltidea canina—The dog-lichen. Gaelic: <gai>lus ghonaich<eng> (from <gai>gòin,<eng> wound; <gai>gòineach,<eng> agonising). This plant was formerly used for curing distemper and hydrophobia in dogs. The name <gai>“gearan,<eng> the herb dog’s-ear,” is given in the dictionaries.


[TD 98]

Probably this name was applied to this plant, meaning a complaint, a groan. Welsh: gerain, to squeak, to cry.

Lecanora.—Etymology of this word uncertain (in Celtic, lech or <gai>leac,<eng> means a stone, a flag). Greek: [Greugais].

L. tartarea—Cudbear. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>corcar<eng> or <gai>corcur,<eng> meaning purple, crimson. This lichen was extensively used to dye purple and crimson. It is first dried in the sun, then pulverised and steeped, commonly in urine, and the vessel made air-tight. In this state it is suffered to remain for three weeks, when it is fit to be boiled in the yarn which it is to colour. In many Highland districts many of the peasants get their living by scraping off this lichen with an iron hoop, and sending it to the Glasgow market. M‘Codrum alludes to the value of this and the next lichen in his line

<gai>“Spréigh air mointich,
Òr air chlachan.”<eng>

Cattle on the hills,
Gold on the stones.

Parmelia saxatilis and omphalodes—Stone and heath parmelia. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crotal.<eng> These lichens are much used in the Highlands for dyeing a reddish brown colour, prepared like tartarea. And so much did the Highlanders believe in the virtues of <gai>crotal<eng> that, when they were to start on a journey, they sprinkled it on their hose, as they thought it saved their feet from getting inflamed during the journey. Welsh: cen dù, black head, applied to the species Omphalodes.

Sticta pulmonacea (Pulmonaria of Lightfoot)—Lungwort lichen. Scotch: hazelraw. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>crotal coille (“coille”<eng> of the wood), upon the trunks of trees in shady woods. It was used among Celtic tribes as a cure for lung diseases, and is still used by Highland old women in their ointments and potions.

According to Shaw, the term grim was applied as a general term for lichens growing on stones. Martin, in his description of his journey to Skye, refers to the superstition “that the natives observe the decrease of the moon for scraping the scurf from the stones.” The two useful lichens, <gai>corcur<eng> and <gai>crotal,<eng> gave rise to the suggestive proverb—

<gai>“Is fhearr a’ chlach gharbh air am faighear rud-eigin, na ’chlach mhìn air nach faighear dad idir.”<eng>

Better the rough stone that yields something, than the smooth stone that yields nothing.


[TD 99]

FUNGI.

Agaricus—The mushroom. Irish and Gaelic dictionaries give <gai>agairg<eng> for mushroom. Welsh: cullod.

A. campestris—<gai>Balg bhuachail (balg<eng> is an ancient Celtic word, and in most languages has the same signification—viz., a bag, wallet, pock, &c. (Greek, [Greugais]; Latin, bulga; Sax. belge; Ger. bálg), <gai>buachail,<eng> a shepherd). <gai>Balg losgainn (losgann<eng> a frog, and in some places <gai>bàlg bhuachair,—buachar,<eng> dung), <gai>Leirin sugach.<eng> In Aberfeldy A. campestris is called <gai>bonaid bhuidhli smachain<eng> (Dr M‘Millan).

Boletus bovinus—Brown boletus. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>bonaid an losgainn,<eng> the toad’s bonnet; and also applied to other species of this genus.

Tuber cibarium—Truffle. <gai>Ballan losgainn,<eng> Dr M‘Millan, from <gai>ball,<eng> a ball, a tuber. These are subterraneous ball-like bodies, something like potatoes, found in beech-woods in Glen Lyon; and probably applied to other species as well.

Lycoperdon giganteum—The large fuz-ball or devil’s snuff-box. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>beac, beacan,<eng> from <gai>beach,<eng> a bee. This mushroom or puff-ball was used formerly (and is yet) for smothering bees; it grows to a large size, sometimes even two or three feet in circumference. <gai>Trioman<eng> (O’Reilly).

L. gemmatum—The puff-ball, fuz-ball. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>caochag,<eng> from <gai>caoch<eng> (Latin, cæcus), blind, empty, blasting. It is a common idea that its dusty spores cause blindness. <gai>Bàlg smùid,<eng> the smoke-bag; <gai>bàlg séididh,<eng> the puff-bag. <gai>Bàlg peiteach bocan,<eng> or <gai>bochdan-bearrach (bochdan,<eng> a hobgoblin, a sprite, and <gai>bearr,<eng> brief, short), and <gai>bonaid an losgainn,<eng> are frequently applied to all the mushrooms, puff-balls, and the whole family of the larger fungi.

Polyporus.—The various forms of cork-like fungi growing on trees are called <gai>caise<eng> (Irish), meaning cheese, and in Gaelic <gai>spuing<eng> or (Irish) <gai>spuinc,<eng> sponge, from their porous spongy character.

P. fomentarius and betulinus—Soft tinder. Gaelic: <gai>cailleach spuinge,<eng> the spongy old woman,—a corruption of the Irish <gai>caisleach spuine,<eng> soft, cheese-like sponge. It is much used still by Highland shepherds for making amadou or tinder, and for sharpening razors.

Mucedo—Moulds. Gaelic: <gai>cloimh liath,<eng> grey down. Mildew, <gai>milcheo.<eng>


[TD 100]

Mushrooms bear a conspicuous part in Celtic mythology from their connection with the fairies,—they formed the tables for their merry feasts. Fairy rings (Marasmius oreades, other species of Agarici) were unaccountable to our Celtic ancestors save by the agency of supernatural beings.


ALGÆ.

The generic names assigned to sea-weeds in Gaelic are: <gai>feamainn (feam,<eng> a tail); <gai>trailleach<eng> (M‘Alpine), (from <gai>tràigh,<eng> shore, sands); <gai>barra-rochd (barr,<eng> a crop), <gai>roc.<eng> Greek: [Greugais]. French: roche, a rock. Welsh: gwymon, sea-weed. French: varec, from Sanscrit, bharc, through the Danish vrag. All the olive-coloured sea-weeds go by the general name <gai>feamainn buidhe;<eng> the dark-green, <gai>feamainn dubh;<eng> and the red, <gai>feamainn derg.<eng>

Fucus vesiculosus—Sea-ware, kelp-ware, black tang, lady-wrack. Gaelic: <gai>propach,<eng> sometimes <gai>prablach,<eng> tangled; in some places <eng>gròbach, gròb,<eng> to dig, to grub.

This fucus forms a considerable part of the winter supply of food for cattle, sheep, and deer. In the Hebrides cheeses are dried without salt, but are covered with the ashes of this plant, which abounds in salt. It was also used as a medicinal charm. “If, after a fever, one chanced to be taken ill of a stitch, they (the inhabitants of Jura) take a quantity of lady-wrack and red fog and boil them in water; the patients sit upon the vessel and receive the fume, which by experience they find effectual against the distemper.”—MARTIN’S ‘Western Isles.’

F. nodosus—Knobbed sea-weed. Gaelic: <gai>feamainn bholgainn, builgach,—bolg, builg,<eng> a sack, a bag, from the vesicles that serve to buoy up the plant amidst the waves. <gai>Feamuinn buidhe,<eng> the yellow wrack. It is of an olive-green colour; the receptacles are yellow.

F. serratus—Serrated sea-weed. Gaelic: <gai>feamainn dubh,<eng> black wrack. <gai>Aon chasach,<eng> one-stemmed, applies to this plant when single in growth.

F. canaliculatus—Channelled fucus. Gaelic: <gai>feamainn chirean (cìr,<eng> a comb). This plant is a favourite food for cattle, and farmers give it to counteract the injurious effects of sapless food, such as old straw and hay.

Laminaria digitata—Sea-girdles, tangle. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>stamh, slàt-mhàra,<eng> sea-wand. <gai>Duidhean,<eng> the stem, and <gai>liaghag<eng>


[TD 101]

or <gai>leathagan, bàrr stamh,<eng> and <gai>bragair,<eng> names given to the broad leaves on the top. <gai>Doire<eng> (in Skye), tangle. Though not so much used for food as formerly, it is still chewed by the Highlanders when tobacco becomes scarce. It was thought to be an effectual remedy against scorbutic and glandular diseases, even long before it was known to contain iodine. “A rod about four, six, or eight feet long, having at the end a blade slit into seven or eight pieces, and about a foot and a half long. I had an account of a young man who lost his appetite and had taken pills to no purpose, and being advised to boil the blade of the Alga, and drink the infusion boiled with butter, was restored to his former state of health”—MARTIN’S ‘Western Isles.’ By far the most important use to which this plant and the other fuci have been put was the formation of kelp; much employment and profit were derived from its manufacture: e.g., in 1812, in the island of North Uist, the clear profits from the proceeds of kelp amounted to £14,000; but the alteration of the law regarding the duty on barilla reduced the value to almost a profitless remuneration of only £3500.

L. saccharina—Sweet tangle, sea-belt. Gaelic: <gai>smeartan (smear,<eng> greasy). The Rev. Mr M‘Phail gives this name to “one of the red sea-weeds.” Other correspondents give it to this plant.

L. bulbosa—Sea furbelows, bulbous-rooted tangle. Gaelic: <gai>sgrothach.<eng> This name is doubtful (<gai>sgroth,<eng> pimples, postules).

Alaria esculenta—Badderlocks, hen-ware (which may be a contraction of honey-ware, the name by which it is known in the Orkney Islands). Gaelic: <gai>mircean<eng> (one correspondent gives this name to “a red sea-weed”), seemingly the same as the Norse name Mária kjerne,—Mári, Mary, and kjerne is our word kernel, and has a like meaning. In Gaelic and Irish dictionaries, <gai>muirirean<eng> (Armstrong), <gai>muiririn<eng> (O’Reilly), “a species of edible alga, with long stalks and long narrow leaves”—SHAW. In some parts of Ireland, Dr Drummond says, it is called murlins—probably a corruption of <gai>muiririn, muirichlinn, muirlinn<eng> (M‘Alpine), (from <gai>muir, mara,<eng> the sea). It is known in some parts of Ireland by the name <gai>sparain<eng> or <gai>sporain,<eng> purses, because the pinnated leaflets are thought to resemble the Highlander’s <gai>sporan. Gruaigean<eng> (in Skye).

Rhodymenia palmata—Dulse. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>duiliasg,<eng> from <gai>duille,<eng> a leaf, and <gai>uisge,<eng> water—the water-leaf. The Highlanders and Irish still use <gai>duiliasg,<eng> and consider it wholesome


[TD 102]

when eaten fresh. Before tobacco became common, they used to prepare dulse by first washing it in fresh water, then drying it in the sun: it was then rolled up fit for chewing. It was also used medicinally to promote perspiration. <gai>Fithreach,<eng> dulse. <gai>Duiliasg staimhe (staimh,<eng> Laminaria digitata). It grows frequently on the stems of that fucus. <gai>Duiliasg chlaiche<eng>—i.e., on the stones, the stone dulse. <gai>Duileasg<eng> is also given to Laurentia pinnatifida, formerly eaten under the name of pepper dulse.

Porphyra laciniata—Laver, sloke. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>sloucan, slochdan,<eng> from <gai>sloc,<eng> a pool or slake. <gai>Slàbhcean<eng> (in Lewis), <gai>slàbhagan<eng> (Shaw). Lightfoot mentions that “the inhabitants of the Western Islands gather it in the month of March, and after pounding and stewing it with a little water, eat it with pepper, vinegar, and butter; others stew it with leeks and onions.

Ulva latissima—Green ulva. Gaelic: <gai>glasag,<eng> also applied to other edible sea-weeds. In some places in the Western Highlands the names given to laver are also given to this plant. <gai>Glasag,<eng> from <gai>glàs,<eng> blue, or green.

Palmella montana (Ag.)—Lightfoot describes, in his ‘Flora Scotica,’ a plant which he calls Ulva montana, and gives it the Gaelic name <gai>duileasg nam beann<eng>—i.e., the mountain dulse. This plant is Gloeocapsa magma (Kutzing). Protococcus magma (Brebisson, Alg. Fallais). Sorospora montana (Hassall). Lightfoot was doubtless indebted to Martin (whose ‘Western Isles’ furnished him with many of his useful notes on the uses of plants among the Highlanders) for the information respecting such a plant. Martin describes it thus: “There is seen about the houses of Bernera, for the space of a mile, a soft substance resembling the sea-plant called slake [meaning here Ulva latissima], and grows very thick among the grass; the natives say it is the product of a dry hot soil; it grows likewise on the tops of several hills in the island of Harris.” “It abounds in all mountainous regions as a spreading crustaceous thing on damp rocks, usually blackish-looking; but where it is thin the purplish nucleus shines through, giving it a brighter aspect.”—ROY.

Chondrus crispus—Irish moss, known in the Western Highlands by the Irish name an carraceen, as the chief supply used to come from Carrageen in Ireland. At one time it was in much repute, for from it was manufactured a gelatinous easily digested food for invalids, which used to sell for 2s. 6d. per lb. <gai>Mathair


[TD 103]

an duileasg,<eng> the mother of the dulse, as if the dulse had sprung from it.

Corallina officinalis.—Gaelic: <gai>coireall<eng> (M‘Alpine). Latin: corallium, coral. <gai>Linean.<eng> It was used as a vermifuge.

Polysiphonia fastigiata. A tuft of this sea-weed was sent to me with the Gaelic name <gai>Fraoch màra,<eng> sea-heather, written thereon.

Hemanthalia lorea.—The cup-shaped frond from which the long thongs spring is called <gai>aiomlach,<eng> or <gai>iomleach (iomleag,<eng> the navel), from the resemblance of the cup-shaped disc to the navel. Dr Neill mentions that in the north of Scotland a kind of sauce for fish or fowl, resembling ketchup, is made from the cup-like or fungus-like fronds of this sea-weed.

Halydris siliquosa.—Gaelic: <gai>roineach mhàra,<eng> the sea-fern. (In the Isle of Skye.)

Chorda filum—Sea-laces. In Shetland, Lucky Minny’s lines; Ayrshire, dead men’s ropes. Gaelic: <gai>gille mu leann<eng> (or <gai>mu lìon),—gille,<eng> a young man, a servant; <gai>lìon,<eng> a net. Lightfoot mentions that the stalks acquire such toughness as to be used for fishing lines, and they were probably also used in the manufacture of nets. At all events it is a great obstacle when trawling with nets, as it forms extensive sea-meadows of long cords floating in every direction. In some parts <gai>langadair<eng> is given to a “sea-weed, by far the longest one.” This one is frequently from twenty to forty feet in length.

Sargassum vulgare (or bacciferum)—Sea-grapes. Gaelic: <gai>tùrusgar<eng> (sometimes written <gai>trusgar,<eng> from <gai>trus,<eng> gather), from <gai>tùrus,<eng> a journey. This weed is frequently washed by the Gulf Stream across the great Atlantic, with beans, nuts, and seeds, and cast upon the western shores. These are carefully gathered, preserved, and often worn as charms. They are called <gai>uibhean sìthein,<eng> fairy eggs, and it is believed that they will ward off evil-disposed fairies. The nuts are called <gai>cnothan-spuinge,<eng> and most frequently are Dolichas urens and Mimosa scandens. To Callithamnion Plocamium, &c., and various small red sea-weeds, such as adorn ladies’ albums, the Gaelic name <gai>smòcan<eng> is applied.

Confervæ, such as Enteromorpha and Cladophora. Gaelic and Irish: <gai>lianach<eng> or <gai>linnearach (linne,<eng> a pool). Martin describes a plant under the name of <gai>linarich<eng>—“a very thin, small, green plant, about eight, ten, or twelve inches in length; it grows on stones, shells, and on the bare sands. This plant is applied plasterwise to the forehead and temples to procure sleep for


[TD 104]

such as have a fever, and they say it is effectual for the purpose.”—MARTIN’S ‘Hebrides.’ <gai>Barraig uaine,<eng> the green scum on stagnant water. <gai>Feuruisge,<eng> water-grass. <gai>Lochan. Griobharsgaich,<eng> the green scum on water.

<gai>“Tha uisge srùth na dìge
Na shrùthladh dùbh gun sioladh
Le barraig uaine, liògh ghlas,
Gu mi bhlasda grannd,
Féur lochan is tachair
An cìnn an duileag bhàite.”<eng>—M‘INTYRE.

The water in its channel flows,
A dirty stagnant stream,
And algæ green, like filthy cream,
Its surface only shows.
With water-grass, a choking mass,
The water-lily grows.

NOTES.

Page 6.

Nasturtium officinalis—Water-cress. A curious old superstition respecting the power of this plant as a charm to facilitate milk-stealing was common in Scotland and Ireland. “Not long ago, an old woman was found, on a May morning, at a spring-well cutting the tops of water-cresses with a pair of scissors, muttering strange words, and the names of certain persons who had cows, also the words, <gai>“S’ liomsa leath do choud sa”<eng> (half thine is mine). She repeated these words as often as she cut a sprig, which personated the individual she intended to rob of his milk and cream.” “Some women make use of the root of groundsel as an amulet against such charms, by putting it amongst the cream.”—MARTIN. Among the poorer classes, water-cress formed a most important auxiliary to their ordinary food. “If they found a plot of water-cresses or Shamrock, there they flocked as to a feast for the time.”—SPENCER.

Martin evidently refers to this plant, and calls it “Fuga dæmonum.” “John Morrison, who lives in Bernera (Harris), wears the plant called <gai>“Seud”<eng> in the neck of his coat to prevent his seeing of visions, and says he never saw any since he first carried that plant about with him.” Children have a saying when they meet this plant—

St Columbus-wort, unsought, unasked, and, please God, I won’t die to-night.

Shamrock—Wood-sorrel and white clover. The shamrock is said to be worn by the Irish upon the anniversary of St Patrick for the following reason: When the Saint preached the Gospel to the pagan Irish, he illustrated the doctrine of the Trinity by showing them a trefoil, which was ever afterwards worn upon the Saint’s anniversary. “Between May-day and harvest, butter, new cheese, and curds and shamrock, are the food of the meaner sort all this season.”—PIERS’S ‘West Meath.’

Gaelic Alphabet. Antecedent to the use of the present alphabet, the ancient Celts wrote on the barks of trees. The


[TD 111]

writing on the bark of trees they called <gai>oghuim,<eng> and sometimes trees, <gai>feadha,<eng> and the present alphabet <gai>litri<eng> or letters.

<gai>“Cormac Casil cona churu,
Leir Mumu, cor mela:
Tragaid im rìgh Ratha Bicli,
Na Litri is na Feadha.”<eng>

Cormac of Cashel with his companions
Munster is his, may he long enjoy;
Around the King of Raith Bicli are cultivated
The LETTERS and the TREES.

The “letters” here signify, of course, our present Gaelic alphabet and writings; but the “trees” can only signify the <gai>oghuim,<eng> letters, which were named after trees indigenous to the country.”—Prof. O’CURRY.

Orobus tuberosus (<gai>Corra meille,<eng> M‘Alpin, and <gai>cairmeal,<eng> Armstrong)—Bitter vetch—and sometimes called “wild liquorice”—seems to be the same name as the French “caramel,” burnt sugar; and according to Webster, Latin, “canna mellis,” or sugar-cane. The fermented liquor that was formerly made from it, called <gai>cairm<eng> or <gai>cuirm,<eng> seems to be the same as the “courmi” which Dioscorides says the old Britons drank. The root was pounded and infused, and yeast added. It was either drunk by itself, or mixed with their ale—a liquor held in high estimation before the days of whisky; hence, the word <gai>“cuirm”<eng> signifies a feast. That their drinking gatherings cannot have had the demoralising tendencies which might be expected, is evident, as they were taken as typical of spiritual communion. In the Litany of “Aengus Céilé Dé,” dating about the year 798, we have a poem ascribed to St Brigid, now preserved in the Burgundian Library, Brussels.

<gai>“Ropadh maith lem corm-lina mor,
Do righ na righ,
Ropadh maith lem muinnter nimhe
Acca hol tre bithe shìr.”<eng>

I should like a great lake of ale
For the King of kings;
I should like the family of heaven
To be drinking it through lime eternal.

To prevent the inebriating effects of ale, “the natives of Mull are very careful to chew a piece of “charmel” root, finding it to be aromatic—especially when they intend to have a drinking-


[TD 112]

bout; for they say this in some measure prevents drunkenness.”—MARTIN’S ‘Western Isles.’

Trees, Thorns. A superstition was common among the Celtic races, that for every tree cut down in any district, one of the inhabitants in that district would die that year. Many ancient forts, and the thorns which surrounded them, were preserved by the veneration, or rather dread, with which the thorns were held; hence, perhaps, the name <gai>sgitheach, sgith<eng> (anciently), fear; hence also, <gai>droighionn (druidh),<eng> enchantment, witchcraft.

Page 20.

Rubus fruticosus,—(<gai>Smearagan<eng>) Blackberries. It was and is, I believe, still a common belief in the Highlands that each blackberry contains a poisonous worm. Another popular belief is—kept up probably to prevent children eating them when unripe—that the fairies defiled them at Michaelmas and Halloween.

Page 24.

Pyrus aucuparia—(<gai>Craobh chaoran<eng>) Mountain-ash. The Highlanders have long believed that good or bad luck is connected with various trees. The <gai>caoran<eng> or <gai>fuinnseach coille<eng> (the wood enchantress) was considered by them as the most propitious of trees; hence, it was planted near every dwelling-house, and even far up in the mountain-glens, still marking the spot of the old shielings. “And in fishing-boats as are rigged with sails, a piece of the tree was fastened to the haul-yard, and held as an indispensable necessity.” “Cattle diseases were supposed to have been induced by fairies, or by witchcraft. It is a common belief to bind unto a cow’s tail a small piece of mountain-ash, as a charm against witchcraft.”—MARTIN. And when malt did not yield its due proportion of spirits, this was a sovereign remedy. In addition to its other virtues, its fruit was supposed to cause longevity. In the Dean of Lismore’s Book there occurs a very old poem, ascribed to Caoch O’Cluain (Blind O’Cloan); he described the rowan-tree thus—

<gai>“Caorthainn do bhi air Loch Maoibh do chimid an traigh do dheas,
Gach a ré ’us gach a mios toradh abuich do bhi air.
Seasamh bha an caora sin, fa millise no mil a bhlàth,
Do chumadh a caoran dearg fear gun bhiadh gu ceann naoi tràth,
Bleadhna air shaoghal gach fir do chuir sin is sgeul dearbh.”<eng>

A rowan-tree stood on Loch Mai,
We see its shore there to the south;
Every quarter, every month,
It bore its fair, well-ripened fruit;


[TD 113]

There stood the tree alone, erect,
Its fruit than honey sweeter far,
That precious fruit so richly red
Did suffice for a man’s nine meals;
A year it added to man’s life.”
—Translated by Dr M‘LAUCHLAN.

Ribes grossularia. The prickles of the gooseberry-bush were used as charms for the cure of warts and the stye. A wedding-ring laid over the wart, and pricked through the ring with a gooseberry thorn, will remove the wart. Ten gooseberry thorns are plucked to cure the stye—nine are pointed at the part affected, and the tenth thrown over the left shoulder.

Page 31.

Meum athamanticum—<gai>Muilceann.<eng> The Inverness local name for this plant, <gai>“Bricin,”<eng> is probably named after St Bricin, who flourished about the year 637. He had a great establishment at <gai>Tuaim Drecain.<eng> His reputation as a saint and <gai>“ollamh,”<eng> or doctor, extended far and wide; to him <gai>Cennfaeladh,<eng> the learned, was carried to be cured after the battle of <gai>Magh Rath.<eng> He had three schools for philosophy, classics, and law. It seems very strange, however, that this local name should be confined to Inverness, and be unknown in Ireland, where St Bricin was residing.

Page 32.

Pastinaca sativa—(<gai>Curran geal<eng>) The white wild carrot, parsnip. The natives of Harris make use of the seeds of the wild white carrot, instead of hops, for brewing their beer, and they say it answers the purpose sufficiently well, and gives the drink a good relish besides.

“There is a large root growing amongst the rocks of this island—the natives call it the <gai>‘Curran petris’<eng> the rock-carrot—of a whitish colour, and upwards of two feet in length, where the ground is deep, and in shape and size like a large carrot.”—MARTIN.

Daucus carota—<gai>Curran buidhe.<eng> “The women present the men (on St Michaelmas Day) with a pair of fine garters, of divers colours, and they give them likewise a quantity of wild carrots.”—MARTIN.

Page 34.

Sambucus niger—(<gai>Druman<eng>) The elder. “The common people [of the Highlands] keep as a great secret in curing wounds the


[TD 114]

leaves of the elder, which they have gathered the first day of April, for the purpose of disappointing the charms of witches. They affix them to their doors and windows.”—C. DE IRYNGIN, at the Camp of Athole, June 30, 1651.

Misletoe and ivy were credited with similar powers. “The inhabitants cut withies of misletoe and ivy, make circles of them, keep them all the year, and pretend to cure hectic and other troubles by them.”—See Appendix to Pennant’s ‘Tour.’

“The misletoe,” says Valancey, in his ‘Grammar of the Irish Language,’ “was sacred to the Druids, because not only its berries, but its leaves also, grew in clusters of three united to one stock.”

Page 38.

Carduus benedictus—<gai>Fothannan beannuichte,<eng> though applied to “Marianus” is probably “Centaurea benedictus” and was so called from the many medicinal virtues it was thought to possess. It is a native of Spain and the Levant.

C. heterophyllus—Melancholy thistle. Was said to be the badge of James I. of Scotland. A most appropriate badge; but yet it had no connection with the unfortunate and melancholy history of the Stuarts, but was derived from the belief that a decoction of this plant was a sovereign remedy for madness, which, in older times, was called “melancholy.”

The plant generally selected to represent the Scotch heraldic thistle is Onopordon acanthium, the cotton thistle, and, strange to say, it does not grow wild in Scotland. Achaius, king of Scotland (in the latter part of the eighth century), is said to have been the first to have adopted the thistle for his device. Favine says Achaius assumed the thistle in combination with the rue: the thistle, because it will not endure handling; and the rue, because it would drive away serpents by its smell, and cure their poisonous bites. The thistle was not received into the national arms before the fifteenth century.

Quercus robur—<gai>Darach.<eng> The age of the oak-tree was a matter of much curiosity to the old Gaels:—

<gai>“Trì aois coin, aois eich;
Trì aois eich, aois duine;
Trì aois duine, aois féidh;
Trì aois féidh, aois fìrein;
Trì aois fìrein, aois craoibh-dharaich.”<eng>

Thrice dog’s age, age of horse.
Thrice horse’s age, age of man;
Thrice man’s age, age of deer;
Thrice deer’s age, age of eagle;
Thrice eagle’s age, age of oak.


[TD 115]

“The natives of Tiree preserve their yeast by an oaken wyth, which they twist and put into it, and for future use keep it in barley straw.”—MARTIN.

Page 43.

Chrysanthemum leucanthemum—Ox-eye daisy, called in Gaelic <gai>“Breinean brothach.” Breinean<eng> or <gai>brainean<eng> also means a king; Welsh, brenhin. The word is now obsolete in the Highlands. The plant was a remedy for the king’s-evil.

Page 44.

Achillea millefolium—<gai>Earr thalmhainn.<eng> The yarrow, cut by moonlight by a young woman, with a black-handled knife, and certain mystic words, similar to the following, pronounced—

“Good-morrow, good-morrow, fair yarrow,
And thrice good-morrow to thee;
Come, tell me before to-morrow,
Who my true love shall be.”

The yarrow is brought home, put into the right stocking, and placed under the pillow, and the mystic dream is expected; but if she opens her lips after she has pulled the yarrow, the charm is broken. Allusion is made to this superstition in a pretty song quoted in the ‘Beauties of Highland Poetry,’ p. 381, beginning—

<gai>“Gu’n dh’eirich mi moch, air madainn an dé,
’S ghearr mi’n earr-thalmhainn, do bhri mo sgéil;
An dùil gu’m faicinn-sa rùin mo chléibh;
Ochòin! gu’m facas, ’s a cùl rium féin.”

I rose yesterday morning early,
And cut the yarrow according to my skill,
Expecting to see the beloved of my heart.
Alas! I saw him—but his back was towards me.

The superstitious customs described in Burns’s “Halloween” were common among the Celtic races, and are more common on the western side of Scotland, from Galloway to Argyle, in consequence of that district having been occupied for centuries by the Dalriade Gaels.

Page 47.

Fraxinus excelsior—<gai>Craobh uinnseann<eng> (the ash-tree) was a most potent charm for cures of diseases of men and animals—e.g., murrain in cattle, caused, it was supposed, by being stung in the mouth, or by being bitten by the larva of some moth. “Bore a hole in an ash-tree, and plug up the caterpillar in it, the leaves of that ash are a sure specific for that disease.”


[TD 116]

Martin adds, “the chief remedies were ‘charms’ for the cure of their diseases.”

Page 51.

Verbena officinalis—<gai>Trombhod.<eng> Borlase, in his ‘Antiquities of Cornwall,’ speaking of the Druids, says: “They were excessively fond of the vervain; they used it in casting lots and foretelling events. It was gathered at the rising of the dog-star.”

Page 68.

Corylus avellana—Càlltuinn. Còl, càl, in Welsh, signifies loss, also hazel-wood. The Welsh have a custom of presenting a forsaken lover with a stick of hazel, probably in allusion to the double meaning of the word.

Page 78.

Allium porrum—<gai>“Bugha.”<eng> The explanation given by Shaw that this was a name for leek seemed improbable, especially as it was a favourite comparison to the eye “when it is blue or dark.” Turning to a passage describing Cormac Mac Airt, I found—

<gai>“Cosmail ri bugha a shùili,”<eng>

which Professor O’Curry renders—

“His eyes were like slaes,”—

a far more appropriate comparison. Narcissus, <gai>Lus a chròmchinn<eng> (the bent head), suggests the beautiful lines of Herrick—

“When a daffodill I see
Hanging its head t’wards me,
Guesse I may what I must be:
First, I shall decline my head;
Secondly, I shall be dead;
Lastly, safely burried.”

Page 79.

A. ursinum—<gai>Creamh.

“’Is leigheas air gach tinn
Creamh ’us ìm a’ Mhaigh.”<eng>

Garlic and May butter
Are remedies for every illness.

“Its medicinal virtues were well known; but like many other plants once valued and used by our ancestors, it is now quite superseded by pills and doses prepared by licensed practitioners.”—Sheriff NICOLSON.


[TD 117]

Page 81.

Potamogeton natans—<gai>Duiliasg na h’aibhne.<eng> The broad-leaved pondweed is used in connection with a curious superstition in some parts of Scotland, notably in the West Highlands. “It is gathered in small bundles in summer and autumn, where it is found to be plentiful, and kept until New Year’s Day (old style); it is then put for a time into a tub or other dish of hot water, and the infusion is mixed with the first drink given to milch cows on New-Year’s Day morning. This is supposed to keep the cows from witchcraft and the evil eye for the remainder of the year! It is also supposed to increase the yield of milk.”—Rev. A. STEWART, Nether Lothaber.

Page 87.

Arundo phragmites—<gai>Cruisgiornach (cruisigh,<eng> in Irish, music, song). Reeds were said by the Greeks to have tended to subjugate nations by furnishing arrows for war, to soften their manners by means of music, and to lighten their understanding by supplying implements for writing. These modes of employment mark three different stages of civilisation. The great reed mace (Typha latifolia) <gai>cuigeal nam bàn sithe,<eng> is usually represented by painters in the hand of our Lord, as supposed to be the reed with which He was smitten by the Roman soldiers, and on which the sponge filled with vinegar was reached to Him.

Oats—<gai>Coirc.<eng> Martin mentions an ancient custom observed on the 2d of February. The mistress and servant of each family take a sheaf of oats and dress it in woman’s apparel, put it in a large basket, with a wooden club by it, and this they call Briid’s bed. They cry three times Briid is come, and welcome. This they do before going to bed, and when they rise in the morning they look at the ashes for the impress of Briid’s club there; if seen, a prosperous year will follow.

Algæ—<gai>Feamainn.<eng> The inhabitants of the Isle of Lewis had an ancient custom of sacrificing to a sea-god called “Shony” at Hallowtide. The inhabitants round the island came to the church of St Mulvay, each person having provisions with him. One of their number was selected to wade into the sea up to the middle, and carrying a cup of ale in his hand, standing still in that position, crying out with a loud voice, “Shony, I give you this cup of ale, hoping you will be so kind as to send us plenty of sea-ware for enriching our ground the ensuing year.” And he then threw the cup into the sea. This was performed


[TD 118]

in the night-time; they afterwards returned to spend the night in dancing and singing.

Shony (Sjoni), the Scandinavian Neptune. This offering was a relic of pagan worship introduced into the Western Isles by the Norwegians when they conquered and ruled over these islands centuries ago (see footnote, p. 40).

K’EOGH’S WORKS.—The Rev. John K’Eogh wrote a work on the plants of Ireland, ‘Botanalogica Universalis Hibernia,’ and another on the animals, ‘Zoologica Medicinalis Hibernia,’ about the year 1739, giving the Irish names as pronounced by the peasantry at that period. They are now rare works, and are of no value save for the names, for they contain no information except the supposed medicinal virtues of the plants and animals given in them.

All creatures, from the biggest mammal to the meanest worm, and all plants, were supposed to have some potent charm or virtue to cure disease. A large number of K’Eogh’s prescriptions are compounds of the most disgusting ingredients. We can only now smile at the credulity that would lead any one to imagine that by merely looking at the yellow-hammer (Emberiza citrinella) “by any one who has the jaundice, the person is cured, but the bird will die.” Or that “the eyes drawn entire out of the head of a hare taken in March, and dried with pepper, and worn by women, will facilitate childbirth.”

He gives this singular cure for the jaundice: “A live moth, laid on the navel till it dies, is an excellent remedy! Nine grains of wheat taken up by a flea, are esteemed good to cure a chincough—that insect is banished and destroyed by elder leaves, flowers of pennyroyal, rue, mint, and fleabane, celandine, arsmart, mustard, brambles, lupin, and fern-root.” For worms: “Take purslane seeds, coralina, and St John’s-wort, of each an equal part; boil them in spring water. Or take of the powders of hiera picra (Picris hieracioides), of the seeds of the bitter apple, of each one dram, mixed with the oil of rue and savin, spread on leather, and apply it to the navel; this is an approved remedy.” Epilepsy—“The flesh of the moor hen, with rosemary, lemons, lavender, and juniper berries, will cure it.” And for children—“Take a whelp (cullane), a black sucking puppy (but a bitch whelp for a girl), strangle it, open it, and take out the gall, and give it to the child, and it will cure the falling-sickness.” One more example will sufliciently illustrate the value of K’Eogh’s books’. “’Usnea capitis humani, or the


[TD 119]

moss growing on a skull that is exposed to the air, is a very good astringent, and stops bleeding if applied to the parts, or even held in the hand.”

<gai>Ollamh.<eng> This was the highest degree, in the ancient Gaelic system of learning, and before universities were established, included the study of law, medicine, poetry, classics, &c. A succession of such an order of literati, the Beatons, existed in Mull from time immemorial, until after the middle of last century. Their writings were all in Gaelic, to the amount of a large chestful. Dr Smith says that the remains of this treasure were bought as a literary curiosity for the library of the Duke of Chandos, and perished in the wreck of that nobleman’s fortune. If this lost treasure could be recovered, we would have valuable material for a more complete collection of Gaelic names of plants, and information as to the uses to which they were applied, than we now possess.


MEDICINAL PLANTS.—The common belief that a plant grew not far from the locality where the disease prevailed, that would cure that disease, led to many experiments which ultimately resulted in finding out the undoubted virtues of many plants; but wholesale methods were frequently adopted by gathering all the herbs, or as many as possible, in that particular district and making them into a bath.

At the battle of <gai>“Magh Tuireadh,”<eng> we are informed “that the chief physician prepared a healing bath or fountain with the essences of the principal herbs and plants of Erinn, gathered chiefly in <gai>Lus-Magh,<eng> or the Plain of Herbs; and on this bath they continued to pronounce incantations during the battle. Such of the men as happened to be wounded in the fight were immediately plunged into the bath, and they were instantly refreshed and made whole, so that they were able to return and fight against the enemy again and again.”—Prof. O’CURRY.

INCANTATIONS WITH PLANTS.—Cures by incantations were most common. A large number of plants were thus employed. When John Roy Stewart sprained his ankle, when hiding after the battle of Culloden, he said:—

<gai>“Ni mi’n ubhaidh rinn Peadar do Phàl,
’S a lùighean air fàs leum bruaich,
Seachd paidir n’ ainm Sagairt a’s Pàp
Ga chuir ris na phlàsd mu’n cuairt.”<eng>


[TD 120]

I’ll make the incantation that Peter made for Paul,
With the herbs that grew on the ground:
Seven paternosters in the name of priest and pope,
Applied like a plaster around.

“And if the dislocated joints did not at once jump into their proper places during the recitation, the practitioner never failed to augur favourably of the comfort to the patient. There were similar incantations for all the ills that flesh is heir to: the toothache could not withstand the potency of Highland magic; dysentery, gout, &c., had all their appropriate remedies in the never-failing incantations.”—M‘KENZIE. See ‘Beauties of Highland Poetry,’ p. 268, where several of the “orations” repeated as incantations are given.

PLANTS AND FAIRY SUPERSTITIONS.—A large number of plant-names in Gaelic have reference to fairy influence. At births many ceremonies were used to baffle the fairy influence over the child (see page 57), otherwise it would be carried off to fairyland. The belief in fairies as well as most of these superstitions, is traceable to the early ages of the British Druids, on whose practices they are founded. The foxglove <gai>(Meuran sithe), odhran,<eng> the cow-parsnip, and <gai>copagach,<eng> the docken, were credited with great power in breaking the fairy spell; on the other hand, some plants were supposed to facilitate the fairy spell, and would cause the individual to be fairy “struck” or <gai>“buillite.”<eng> The water-lily was supposed to possess this power, hence its names, <gai>Buillite,<eng> and <gai>Rabhagach,<eng> meaning beware, warning. Rushes found a place in fairy mythology: Schœnus nigricans (<gai>Seimhean<eng>) furnished the shaft of the elf arrows, which were tipped with white flint, and bathed in the dew that lies on the hemlock.

NETTLES—“They also used the roots of nettles and the roots of reeds as cures for coughs.” In some parts of Ireland there is a custom on May eve and May day amongst the children, especially the girls, of running amuck with branches of nettles, stinging every one they meet. They had also a belief that steel made hot and dipped in nettle-juice made it flexible. Camden says “that the Romans cultivated nettles when in Britain in order to rub their benumbed limbs with them, on account of the intense cold they suffered when in Britain.” A remedy worse than the disease.
