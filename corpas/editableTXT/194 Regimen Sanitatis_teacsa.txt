6. Galen (Claudius) was born at Pergamos, Asia Minor, A.D. 130. His father, a noted architect and mathematician, gave him a good education, intending to follow the study of medicine. We learn from his writings that he studied under the best physicians of Smyrna, Corinth and Alexandria, and that he travelled widely in quest of knowledge. In his twenty-eighth year he settled in his native town, where he remained for five years. He then went to Rome, where his skill soon brought him into prominence. Envious of his great success as physician and teacher the other physicians made his position so uncomfortable that he went back to Asia, after a while again settling in Pergamos. In A.D. 169 he was again back in Rome upon the invitation of Marcus Aurelius. After some years in Rome, practising, lecturing, and writing, he seems to have returned to Pergamos, but little more is known of his life. Neither the time nor the place of his death is known. He wrote a great number of treatises upon medicine and philosophy—perhaps hundreds—but very many were lost at Rome, where his house was burnt. He also

wrote fifteen commentaries on the works of Hippocrates. (See Col. 6.)

7. Hali sa treas partegul do thegni H. in the third Particle of his τέχνη. This most probably refers to the translation of Hali’s works by “Constantine the African” under the title of Pantegni. Hali’s most important work was “El Malika” or the Royal Book. He was a strong hygienist and an independent observer and thinker, basing his practice and his writings upon his determination of cause and actual experience rather than upon his teaching or learning. He died A.D. 994.
Constantine (1018-1087) was for a time teacher at Salernum and afterwards became a monk of Monte Casino.

20. tabhair neithi cosmuile similia similibus offeras. This doctrine is extremely comprehensive and valuable. It underlies to a most remarkable extent the great part of what is sensible and truly scientific in modern medical treatment. It simply means “See what Nature is doing and help it on.” The homœopaths have made these words their chief corner stone, but there is no evidence anywhere in their literature that they ever understood the words in their original and philosophical sense. In fact their practice, which they think is based upon this old teaching, is at once conclusive proof that they have not only not understood it but have perverted it into very strange ways. To a thoughtful student of Medicine, and especially of the surgical side, it is of abiding interest to observe how very much of all that is rational and assured in our treatment of the present time is referable to this venerable principle.

28. Aueroys, usually now written, Averrhoes—a corruption of his Arabic name, Ibn Roshd, or as we should say, Mac-Roshd. He was born at Cordova in Spain in the early half of the twelfth century, where his father was chief magistrate. His early education was directed towards theology and philosophy. He succeeded his father in the magistracy, and was also appointed Cadi of the province of Mauretania by the king of Morocco. His learning and his great gifts were envied. He was charged with having rejected the established religion, and, after being deprived of his offices, he was banished to Spain. Here again he was envied and persecuted, so he fled to Fez and after further persecution there, he was ultimately restored to his dignities by the enlightened Caliph Al Mansur. After an active life he died in Morocco in the beginning of the thirteenth century. Aristotle was to him

[TD 62]

LINE
the greatest of philosophers. He wrote translations of, and commentaries upon, the philosophy of Aristotle to such an extent that he was nick-named the Interpreter.
He wrote a compendium of medicine, called Colliget in translations, but a corruption of Arabic “Kullyat” meaning Universal. The Colliget is frequently referred to in our Text.

31. Auicina, now commonly Avicenna for Ibn-Sina, Arabian physician and philosopher, was born near Bokhara A.D. 980. Aristotle was his favourite philosopher. He tells us that he read the Metaphysics forty times before he understood it. He was very precocious, finishing his early education at the age of eighteen, when he began to practise as a physician. Losing his father, at the age of twenty-two, he spent several years in travel, studying his profession, and then he settled down at Hamadan as private physician to a noble lady. He was soon afterwards appointed Vizier to the Emir. On the death of his patron, the son and successor did not continue him as Vizier so he went into retirement, meanwhile writing diligently upon his favourite studies in philosophy and medicine. He offered his services to the Sultan of Ispahan and so came under the suspicion of the Emir, who put him in prison. He escaped, however, to Ispahan, where he was received with great honour. He lived and worked here in peace for fourteen years. He died A.D. 1037. His principal medical work was the Canon Medicinae, often referred to in our text. He also left many commentaries upon the works of Aristotle.

3. Tota species. I have not been able to find out where this expression had origin. It clearly means the same as our word digestion in its widest sense. It seems to imply a big truth, namely, that digestion is not a matter limited to the stomach alone, but is a function of the whole body and of every part of it. Our nails and our hair digest, select, and assimilate the elements of food that are proper to them as surely and as correctly as do our muscles and our bones. The whole body is a digestive organ.
“And from the heat as instrument.” This also is a complete expression of actuality. The less heat the weaker function. The higher heat the more life. No heat, no life at all.

[TD 63]

LINE
The words “form,” “degree,” and “high” and “low,” “hot” and “cold,” in this connection have no meaning, and can have no meaning in our day. They were artificial and unnatural concepts, of the empirical form of thought, which imagined man to stand apart from, and outside Nature. The whole truth is well stated in the Sixth Chapter, “As all Nature is, that is God, and so Nature is ordered in man.” Man is Nature, Nature’s highest product and expression. Man is the microcosm; Nature is the macrocosm. In Heine’s wonderful statement, “The Ego equals the non-Ego,” the whole of wisdom is complete.

20. biadh is biadh “cibum absolute.”

24. Calidiora calidioribus, etc.—the full quotation needs indigent adjumentis.

25. Cuttromacht is here used in its original and best sense of equipoise, or, as Latin has it, equalitate. In the modern speech it always means weight or heaviness.


COLUMN 3.

9. Coimplex lenna duibh—lenna find—lenna ruaidh. These are the Complexions, Temperaments or Idiosyncrasies of the individual body—in older times called Melancholic, Phlegmatic and Sanguineous. In the translation I have rendered the words literally. There is something of a general truth underlying these concepts, and the practice based upon them is not disregarded even in the present time. Crasim is the Latin in Col. 1 for coimplex from Gr. κράσις a combination whence ἰδιο-σύν-κράσις idiosyncrasy, or as it occurs in Old English, “His bodies crasis is angelicall” (1616).

11. an aithfheghadh coimplex lenna duibh respectu complexionis melancolice.

12. Commentator an Damasenus—the Damascene Commentator, was “Janus Damascenus” Jahjah ebn Massiweih, a famous physician and teacher of Harun, and a prolific translator from the Greek. He lived 780-857.

28. don cháil gustrasda nearly misled me into making it gustatory, but it is really for gusan dtráth so lately or up to this time—de qualitate cibi jam dictum est.

3. Do chaindigecht in bidh—Of the Quantity of the Food—Quantitas cibi, is the Heading of the Second Chapter of the Tract, although it ends the First as may be seen. Dlighear a chaithimh intan tochluighter e, it (food) should be eaten in the time that is desired. This is, of course, a simple commonsense observation, yet, not always acted upon. The word caithimh has a wide range of usage. Gu meal ’s gu’n caith thu e may you enjoy it and wear it out is a kindly Gaelic wish when a friend gets a new suit of clothes. Chaith e a mhaoin he spent or wasted his means. Caitheamh is the disease consumption. In our Text it is used of the using, eating, or consuming of food, always. A little thought will show that the essential idea is the same throughout. Tochluighter is from tochluighim, which I cannot find in the dictionaries, but throughout the text it plainly means desire, disposition, and appetite most frequently.

4. Arustotul—in epistula ad Alexandrum. Aristotle was born at Stagira in South Macedonia, B.C. 384. His father, Nichomachus, was a physician of the race of the Asclepiadae who traced their descent from Aesculapius. The profession of medicine was hereditary in the family of the Asclepiads, and Aristotle was seventeenth in descent from the founder of the family and the profession. Diogenes Laertius tells us that Aristotle was with Plato at Athens for some twenty years, after which he went to take charge of the education of Alexander the Great for several years. After this he had a school at Athens from 335 to 322 B.C. when he retired to Chalcis where he died shortly afterwards. Some of Aristotle’s works are well-known. He was the founder of the Peripatetic School of Philosophy and the originator of the scientific method of investigation and of reasoning. It is safe to say that no human being ever used language so precisely, so closely, and so keen-edged, as Aristotle used it for the expression of the highest efforts of the human intellect. The best minds of mankind have strived to follow him. He remains the supreme model of thought and expression and, as would seem, for all time.

25. do ní duinte ocus is cúis sin don mhorgadh cibus excedens debitum oppilat et est causa putredinis. Duinte is from dúin

close up; it is Lat. oppilatio which is explained in another part of the Rosa as “Oppilatio hepatis est constrictio seu coarctio seu clausio venarum quae sunt in hepate seu in poris et foraminibus quae sunt in substantia ejus.” See Col. 14, 34.

26. tre esbhuigh an indfhuartha propter privationem eventationis.—34. égintus innfhuartha in croidhi necessitas eventandi cordis.

28. For innach read in[tan]nach.


COLUMN 5.

3. apititus caininus. I have translated this literally as dog-ish appetite. It is a diseased excess of appetite usually now called Bulimia. Tuitim tochluighi “pigritiam,” sluggishness.

7. This would read better and perhaps be more correct as eirghitt na detaighi inmolta. The Latin is vapores boni ascendunt, and my statement in the Vocabulary should be so corrected—although the MS. reading and the context are quite enough to have led me away.

20. The sign 2 is used for dá two and with a superscript for dara second (23, 34) and for est, and for the terminal syllables -da and -dha. Inverted ɔ is for con always as in ɔtrardha, ɔgmail, etc. The old Latin ȝ for ejus is very neatly used in lȝ = leighius healing or cure. Col. 7, 24.

25. feithi anmfhanda. The word feith is now almost always used for a vein. Cuisle is the word in the Text for a vein (see Col. 27), but in the later usage the word means more correctly an artery. This differentiation is desirable and even necessary. The primary meaning of cuisle is a pipe or hollow tube. The Latin is nervos debiles, but we have no word in Gaelic for nerve so far as I know.

27. intán tosgaighius go himurcrach quando excedit debitum.

40. The spelling imchubhaidh shows that my rendering imchubidh might be better so spelled, but as I had it so set in type I have left it as it was. The same is the case with the word dlighear which I have put in the Scottish Gaelic form throughout. In the division of words I have also leaned towards the Scottish forms rather than towards the Irish method of “eclipsis”—but this does no violence to the language.

4. duine ro-dheisgribhidech homo summe discretionis.

5. an senduine on tsenordhacht, lit. the old man from (because of) the old-agedness, but the latter word seems to have a specific meaning apart from its etymology. O’Reilly renders it as “the fifth stage of human life, from 54 to 84 years of age.” It is, however, very difficult to deny a kinship between it and the Sc. Gaelic seanair a grandfather, which is usually taken to mean sean-athair or old-father. It is, however, equated with sen-ator. The senex of Latin was a man over sixty. The meaning of the Text is however quite clear. It means a man old beyond the generally accepted old man. In the second line we find dona tshenduine on thsendacht to the old man because of his agedness, but here in the sixth line, as quoted, the old man because of his over-agedness—the treatment is different. The Latin in the younger case is seni a senectute, and in the older seni a senio.

6. dibenta decrepiti.

8. lóchrand ullamh cum baithi (leg. báidhti) lucerna parata extinctioni.

9. sa .c. partegul d’amforismorum. This clearly refers to the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, for Galen makes the Comment. It is, in my copy, the 21st Aphorism of the Second Book Λίμον θώρηξις λύει.

12. Fiarfuighim I ask. Compare ag iarraidh seeking, Col. 10. These words are part of the same verb but the one has initial f and the other has not. This f initial is not “organic”; it does not belong to the first part of the original compound word iar + fach which is the preposition iar after. It is called “prosthetic.” It seems to be a matter of dialect and is very unstable. See osluigthi (13) where Sc. Gaelic would have fosgailte open. It comes and it goes readily. It comes very often where it does not belong, and it goes, perhaps as often, where it does, e.g. the Preposition ri which was originally frith, Lat. vert, turn. We have feagal for eagal fear in several districts, and other similar instances might be given.

5. isin tshingcoipis from συγκόπτειν to cut short, usually applied to fatal fainting coming from heart-failure.

10. dá (2) bhriala—see the explanation seven lines down as much as a person can take without drawing breath and yet not restraining it. I cannot trace the word satisfactorily. Bria was old Latin for a wine-vessel, but it is not easy to see a connection with this. Bala is a mouthful in Arabic and this may have been a miswriting. It is certainly interesting that our own word even now for a mouthful is bala-gum. In a text of 1595 it is duas phialas, but in the margin it has “duas brialas est in auctore.”

12. déis cuislindi lit. after the vein, but used here and frequently in the Text for blood-letting—see Col. 27.

13. Dlighear an gnathughadh do coimedh annso mad arrsaigh e muna fa ro-olc e the (usual) habit should be observed here if it is (an) old (custom). Arrsaigh is not now in use and it does not seem to be etymologically related to aois age, for which it is frequently used in the Text. Fa, again, is used here not as the prep, fa = fo under, or as in fadhó, fathrí twice, thrice, but as the verb to be fa = bha. Compare Col. 17, 12.

18. claochlogh anala change of breath—or between one breathing and another. This in Sc. Gaelic is caochladh with base clóim muto, I change. It is very finely used in the common speech for the great change of death. The idea of extinction is entirely absent—excluded. It is never used of the death of animals. Caochladh aghaidh nan speur is the change in the face of the skies. Caochladh na h’aimsire is the change or transition of the seasons. The concept of essential continuity is as clearly implied in the word as is that of simple change. Chaochail e he has changed—Eng. he is dead.

27. san inadh .c. na in the same place. This single .c. is used as here in cétna the same. It is also used for cét first in .c. inadh the first position 27, and for cét a hundred goraibhi a athair fén .c. bliadhan ina bhethaig that his own father was a hundred years in his life—that is, of age 10.


COLUMN 8.

2. taréis na coda after the meal, is for tar trans + éis a trace or footstep. It is always translatable as after even when combined with another prepositive as déis for do + éis. It may take a personal pronoun as tar a éis after it, dom éis after me.

14. fundamínt is the Lat. fundamentum, but what the exact physiological intention here is I cannot well say. It may mean

[TD 68]

LINE
that the food was supposed partly mixed or dissolved and partly not, and that the latter was the fundament.

16. continoidech which I translated as constringent in my Essay, basing it upon Lat. contineo in the sense of holding together, e.g. leighes continoidech astringent medicine will hardly do here. The Latin is multiplicat vices non quantitatem continuam, the unbroken or ordinary quantity. O’Reilly gives cointoiniodeach as customary—from an old source.

18. trí deocha three kinds of drink—Alteratiuus, Permixtinus, Delatiuus. The Alterative was supposed to effect a beneficial change in the body without materially affecting the fluids—the humors. The Permixtinus was a “mixed drink,” but whether it had any fixed formula or any definite aim would seem to be impossible to know. The drink Delatiuus is rendered in Gaelic imairctech, which means removing or changing, and the fact that it should be taken after the meal suggests that this was something like the purpose of it. The word is made up of imm + air + ic to come.
The “Appetiser,” the “bottle of wine,” and the “Liqueur” of civilisation are doubtless descendants of these three drinks, performing similar supposed service.


COLUMN 9.

1. caindighect na nithead is intabhurta quantitas offerendorum. The prefix in-, ion-, signifies fitness or appropriateness, so intabhurta means giveable or what is right to give.

7. D’Órd in Dieta no Caithme in Bhídh—Of the Order of the Diet or the Eating of Food. This begins the Third Chapter as stated at the end of the previous paragraph.

13. coimleadh an corp, let him rub the body, from co + melim I rub or grind, Lat. molo. The same word is used for the teeth (24)—coimleadh a fhiacla le duille uircill ... ocus le croicinn an ubhaill buidhe fricet cum foliis citrulli et eum cortici citri.

23. tursgar na súl very likely a metathesis from trus gather, therefore, what gathers upon the eyes during the night—illud enim aufert lippitudinem oculorum eosque clarificat. Lippio was an old expression for having sore or bleary eyes.

5. lisin thochlughadh ainmhidhe with the animal (natural) desire, appetitu naturali.

10. prolongare—it should be noticed that the loop on the stem of p is in front before, pro the stem, whereas in per it is after the stem—if the vowel is not superscript as in Col. 1, 8.

16. Ni gabdhaois biadha examhla an éinfheacht nec diversa edulia accepisse simul. Examhla = eu + con + samail the negative of cosmail. Ein one + feacht time—the word is not now in use, but it remains, if rather hidden, in the words feasda for ever and fathast yet, which are our present forms for old i-fecht-sa and fo-fecht-sa.

26. meadughadh here has a slightly exceptional meaning. Usually the direct meaning is to enlarge, to make large, but here it means to equate the food to the powers of the stomach—to make the food “as large as” the stomach can use. The Latin has it well as apportionare.

30. o nach feduruis cad is indenta quum ignoras quid sit faciendum.


COLUMN 11.

13. Proindiughadh orduighthi orderly (or proper) feeding—to take food three times in two days. Proind, the base here, is evidently the Lat. prandium “a dinner,” but used in the general sense of a meal. Compare “post prandium” with déis in proindighthi, Col. 12, 22.

14. Fathrí sa dá lá .i. fadhó ládib ocus einfecht lá eile twice in the two days, that is, twice on days and once (only) on the other day. The modern language has lost these very useful forms fadhó, fathrí, etc. They should be restored.
This dietary may seem peculiar—one day two meals and the other day one, or three meals in forty-eight hours. A personal note may be excused. While on a long sea voyage two years ago, I found that the regulation three or four meals a day made

13. Lubra—the word seems essentially to mean, or rather to have meant, leprosy, when that disease was common in this country, but later the word seems to have come to mean simply “disease” in one of its coarser external forms. Specific leprosy seems to have followed the Crusaders into Western Europe. Lazar-houses were numerous in England from eleventh century onwards for more than five hundred years. There was a leper-house at Canterbury in the eleventh century, and one was established in Edinburgh as late as 1591, and it was the end of the eighteenth century before the disease disappeared—in the Shetlands.

14. Lictuairi a lectuary, an old form for electuary. Chaucer has it “Too late cometh the lectuarye.”

17. Drageta. This seems by some way of kinship to be the same as Fr. dragée, a sweetmeat or comfit. A form dragé is used in modern pharmacy for sweetmeat covered medicines.
Rufhus—of Ephesus, a man very greatly in advance of his time (about 50 A.D.) especially as anatomist.

7. Arson nan ae do beith faoi in ghaili because the livers are under the stomach. It is remarkable that the liver is always referred to in the plural form. This implies that they knew the evolution of the human liver, and that morphologically it is a compound organ, or that they made no post-mortem examination or dissection of the human body, and that they derived their knowledge from observations upon the lower animals. It is well known that dissection of the human body was even a rare thing in the old Schools from which our MS. had origin, but in the Latin texts the word is always in the singular, in Gaelic only is it in the plural form.

8. dilighur impog ar in taobh clé you should change to the left side. The writing of dilighur which is wrong for dlighear shows that the writer was copying and that not intelligently. The same sort of error occurs frequently. In Col. 14, 10 móran in bidh was written móran in biadh but it was corrected and even then left wrong.

21. res est manefesta—a new way of writing est.

22. teaguisgaigh an ealadha leighis the art of medicine teaches. This means rather that from the means used an instructive inference can be drawn. If the remedy used, and directed towards a definite purpose, succeeds, then the inference is good that the diagnosis was right.

32. na fastaighter ar én cor iad nec reteneatur ultra quam natura stimulat, let them not for any reason be restrained or withheld. The verb is spelled fostogh in Col. 7. The meaning here is that neither the natural inclination of the bladder or of the bowel should be for any reason restrained beyond the time in which it is the habit to empty them. This advice holds true in our day—and with emphasis—when our most valuable lives are too often wrecked or lost from Appendicitis, of which this unnatural restraint of the bowel is almost if not altogether the simple and sole cause. It is not the farmer or the field-worker or the shepherd who suffers from Appendicitis, but the dweller in the office and especially in the drawing-room. Without anti-peristalsis there would be no Appendicitis; but the very simple physiology of the matter cannot be entered upon here. The advice is powerfully pertinent, and the explanation in the Text is quite complete—“on gaothmuirecht ag impogh suas.” There is no need for any theory of Appendicitis beyond this. A well-known English epitaph gives sound and sincere advice on this matter; but a friend has, for some reason, thought it would be better Latinised, and in his Latin.

16. do leith na haoisi, etc., aetati, regioni et tempori.

21. na cabain inmhedhonach the internal cavities, ventres—the stomach and intestines.

25. oi ni bfuil for there is not. Oi here is for oir. It occurs so, and so often, in the Text that it becomes a suggestion the writer was tongue-tied or lisped. It occurs Col. 17, 4 and 26, where it is followed 28 by oir for uair.

29. doréir shínte in edluis, etc. It is very difficult to understand the concept underlying these phrases. The Latin (which I have been compelled to put in the Translation) is just as difficult to understand. The wording is not difficult but the meaning is.

33. Note q with m superscript for chum, and in 36.

35. Observe the reversion of the writing here to the previous line 34 and continued in the following 36. This is the rule in these MSS. and almost certainly for economy of space—see Cols. 6, 32; 20, 6. Mesurrdha here is temperatus.

13. Ysaac (Ben Soleiman, 830-940) was a pupil of “Johannes Damascenus”—Col. 3, 12. He made a special study of Foods, determining the value not only of the different kinds of flesh, but also of the different parts of the same animal. Though a Jew (hence called Isaac Judaeus) he was strongly in favour of pork as a nourishing food.

27. drong ele a gcinn ocus drong ele a gcnamha. This is perhaps the best example of Irish “eclipsis” in the Text. It occurs with other initial consonants, as may be seen, but not at all regularly. It is not unlikely that the Scottish tendency, which has quite done away with “eclipsis,” was asserting itself at the time. There is a superfluous a at the end of 27.

It is even now in English called “a stroke.” The idea was that the evil spirit came up stealthily and maliciously from behind and struck the unfortunate victim with a mortal, even if invisible hammer, so knocking him down, perhaps never again to rise.

The genesis of the word is given in Cormac’s Glossary as follows: Goibniu, the smith of the Tuath dé Danann, was at his forge making weapons for the battle of Moytura when something affecting the character of his wife came to his ears, and this upset him. “There was a pole in his hand, when he heard the story; Ness was the name of the pole; and he sings spells over the pole; and to every man who came to him he gave a blow of this pole. Then if the man escaped a lump of gory liquid and matter was raised upon him, and the man was burned like fire, for the form of the pole called Ness was on the lump, and therefore it was named Nescoid, from that name. Ness then, that is a swelling, and scoit liquid”—all which may or perhaps may not be quite true. Ma’s breug uam is breug chugam.

bliadhna the year has not as yet been very conclusively explained. It is bliadain in old Irish, and O’Reilly (Introduction) argues at some length that it is the Keltic Bel-ain the great circle of the god Bel or the Sun—for aine, G. fáine, Lat. annus, and anus was and is a ring or circle, and see Dr. Macbain in voc. Bealltuin and Bliadhna.

5. oir ni full én ní coimedus nech ar eslaintibh in t’samhruigh mar do ní cuisli an erruigh for nothing protects a person from the ills of Summer (so well) as does the Spring blood-letting. Coimedus, which I translate protects here, is the same word as often occurs in the sense of seeing or foreseeing—see Col. 1. The Preposition ar is here used very clearly in the sense against.

14. um feil Stefain ocus, etc., about the feast of St. Stephen and about the feast of John Baptist. The Preposition um is here nearer to its original form than is usually met with. In modern Gaelic it is inverted to mu, although it still remains in the compound Prepositions as umam, umad, uime and uimpe, etc. Its cognates are W. am, Cor. and Bret. am and em, Gaulish ambi, Lat. ambi, Gk. ἀμφί.

19. Don taobh as an dlighear a ligen—Concerning the side on which it should be let—a paragraph.

23. do leith an ré regarding the moon. Ré is here used in its classic sense for the moon, which is now a ghealach or the white one. This should be a paragraph.

27. Don diet d’áithli na cuislindi—Of the diet after the Blood-letting—another paragraph.

31. macht cadfarligettur i. This is one of the places in which I find a difficulty in rendering the contraction which reads macht as maseadh, and yet I do not know a form macht, nor can I find one anywhere, cadfarligettur is quem amiserunt.

23. eanbruithi soup, suggests that there is a bird in it, at any rate etymologically, for it is frequently written énbhruithe. The Sc.

5. Eochair gach uile eolais Ipocras, Hippocrates (is) the key of all knowledge, was born in the island of Cos about 460 B.C. He was of the family of hereditary physicians descended from Aesculapius. His father Heraclides, himself a famous physician, taught him in his early days. After extensive travel and a wide experience, he established the great medical school of Cos, where he taught that the right conduct of life and right diet was the basis of health and the cure of all disease. His Aphorisms, which seem to have been culled from his extensive writings either by himself or by some of his followers, though fairly well known, but yet not so well known as they should be, are even now worthy of attention. Some sixty works are left us to his credit, but his authorship of several of these is doubtful. Galen (Col. 1, 6) was his great commentator. He is said to have died at Larissa in Thessaly B.C. 357.

FURTHER NOTES.—I. Sanis to the healthy. It is most interesting to notice how the significance of language changes. Our in-sane people now are out of their mind. In the old time they were out of their health or wholeness. They were “broken” people. It is difficult to see the advance in conception. Perhaps there is none. The best definition of health that I ever learned was from the late Sir James Paget, if I am not mistaken, “If you close your eyes you don’t know you are there at all.” I have met with another definition in a margin of an old Latin text, “Qui bene ingerit, digerit, egerit is est sanus,” but this reduces the human being to an animal machine pure and simple, and it is as well not to translate it into English, and certainly not into Gaelic, for the language is too plain. It reminds us strongly of “Rob Donn’s” famous and perfect definition of the “useless,” Ghineadh iad is rugadh iad is thogadh iad is dh’fhás; chaidh strác do’n t’saoghal thairis orr’ ’s mu dheireadh fhuair iad bás.

The punctum delens is often met with in these MSS. Where the scribe, through carelessness or ignorance, has written a letter which should not be there, he or some one else on noticing the mistake put a dot under the letter. It is seen under the first n of ieinunius VI 16, under i of oire XIX 12, and under ac at end of XXVIII 21.

Aithfegadh comparison, O.D., but in the text compensation would seem to be nearer the meaning as Col. 21 an aithfeaghadh in becain bídh in compensation for the small quantity of food; and in Col. 3 the meaning would seem to be nearly the same an aithfheghadh coimplexa lenna

diubh (twice) in compensation for black humors—to make up for them.

Aithi proofs; probably akin to G. aithne knowledge “co-gnosco”; eolus ocus aithi báis the knowledge and proofs of death 28. Aithaidhim I know, perceive; G. fáth cause, reason. But see the version of the second post-script, p. 57, where the word is written aithne.

Amach out, without, outside. The construction of the word is interesting. It literally means in the field in sa magh and it is the opposite of Asteach (which see) meaning in the house. This is the “motion” form. Amuigh is the “rest” form. We say tha e’dol amach he is going out, but tha e amuigh he is out. The word is used in the text very often as an “extensive”; tar modh amach outside of the usual 12; osoin amach henceforth 27.

Anbhfhaine weakness, from an very + fann faint, weak. The word is written very irregularly; o anmhfainne na bríghi from weakness of the vitality 7; o anmhfainne an ghaile from weakness of the stomach 12; gaili anmfann a weak stomach 23.

[TD 87]

Aon one; W., Bret., Corn. un, Lat. un-us; o aon gnodugh from (any) one cause 16.

Aonda unified, simple, single; ocus ni go h’aonda and not singly 3. “Aonda is the opposite of cumusc,” O.R. It refers to things used as “simples” and not co-mixed or compounded.

Aontighius conforms with, agrees. The verb is based upon aon one, therefore to unify, to bring into agreement; an gnathughadh aontaighius leis na neithi nádurra the

[TD 88]

custom or practice which agrees with natural things—or conditions 17; as seachrannach aontughadh na meisg aon uair is in mí it is wrong to assent to (the getting) drunkenness one time in a month 5.

Aotrom is an + trom unheavy therefore light. It is édrom and édrum in the same Col. 14. The form given first is that of the present Sc. Gaelic. In suiper gerr no édrom the short or light supper.

Aphoplexia—see Note, Col. 20.

Ar has several values, all arising from the fact that the modern form embodies three old forms of different meaning and grammatical conduct: arson for the reason, for the sake of; arson fuighill an alluis for (because of) the remnant of the sweat 9; ar egla for fear 13; ar aon bórd upon one table 10, 12; ar in taobh ndes upon the right side 13; ar in camra upon the “stool” 15; ar dtuitim an bídh after the food has fallen 8. In the old language it is often used in the sense of against, as here; ar eslaintibh in t’samhruigh against the illnesses of summer 21; ocus coimheduigh ar truailledh na lenna and it will prevent the corruption of the humors—against the corruption 26.

Ára kidney, pl. árann, W. aren, Lat. nefrones, Gk. νεφρὸς; itir na h’airnibh between the kidneys 27.

[TD 90]

Brigh has an exceedingly wide range of meanings, all however agreeing in “the essence.” Perhaps strength is the best single word to use for it. We say brigh an sgeoil the “essence” of the tale, brigh an fhocail the essential force or power of the word, brigh an eorna the essential strength or product of barley, that is, alcohol or whiskey, obair gun bhrigh a work without result, ní gun bhrigh a thing without sense or strength, chaill se a bhrigh he or it has lost its “strength,” etc. It is used in this text almost always for strength, imdaighi na brigha “uires multiplicat” 26.

Canoin a Canon, rule; adeir Galen sa canoinsi G. says in this canon 16. The word comes from Gk. κάνων through Latin. It primarily meant a stick, a “cane,” hence a “ruler,” whence a rule or doctrine. It has been confused with G. cánain speech, language, but the words are in no way related. This latter is simply canamhuin language, from can say, speak, which we have in cainnt speech also.

[TD 98]

cudrumacht eli ann if there is other evenness—“ceteris paribus” 19.

Cugat towards or to thee. The prep. gu older cu is here repeated and the t is the second personal ending for tu thou. Scottish Gaelic writes thugad, but this is etymologically wrong; in coimplex dogabuis cugat the general health which thou hast taken to thee 1; nach gabann nigním cuige that he will not suffer from inaction 1.

Cuigedh from cuig five, G. cóig, W. pump, pimp, Corn. pymp, Bret. pemp, Goth. fimf, Lat. quinque, Gr. πέντε—quite a lesson in consonantal change between the languages; in cuigedh inadh the fifth place or position 27.

Is e folmughadh na cuislinne is mó anmfhainighius in brigh, it is the emptying of the vein that most weakens the strength 20; a caibidil na cuislinne in the chapter upon the vein or blood-letting 20; don cuislind, umorro, but regarding the vein, that is, blood-letting 20. Cuisle is frequently used alone for blood-letting.

Deir says; oir a deir Auicina for Avicenna says 9, and frequent. Other parts of this Irregular Verb Abair say, meet us constantly; mar an abair where he says 5; mar a dubhrumar roimhainn as we have said before (us) 10.

Deiredh the end; ar deiredh na coda at the end of the meal 25. Cuid which means a portion seems to mean a meal always in the text. It is interesting that cuideachd a company is the people who share with you what you have to give. Our proverb says Is moide cuid a roinn a portion or a meal is bigger for being shared.

Deisgribhidech written wrongly for deiscreidech discreet; duine ro-dheisgribhidech a very discreet man 6.

Denom, G. denamh to do; ni h’urusa sin do denamh that is not easy to do 10; gurub dimaoin duit ferg do denamh that it is foolishness of thee to make wrath—to get angry 25.

Dibenta “in extremis.” Dibne is extremity—of exhaustion; oir bidh an drong sin dibenta for such people are exhausted 6.

Dimaoinus is the Abstract Noun from dímaoin, that is foolishness, uselessness; oir teid an dimaoinus gach ní dibh so an égmais in misuir for all of these things go into uselessness (are no use) without the moderation 26.

Dirradas seems here to mean a will or direction. It occurs three times in this postscript 28, where it can only have this meaning. The base is dír, díor proper, right, lawful, which occurs several times in Cormac’s Glossary.

Diureticech diuretic; na én ní diureticech nor one thing (anything) diuretic 12.

Dlighim I ought, have a right, it is a duty. Forms of this verb occur so often that quotation is not necessary. The translation will sufficiently show its usage.

Dlistinach lawful, dutiful, right G. dleasnach of same force. This is from a form dligheas I ought, with root dligh a debt or right Welsh dled, and Breton dle, of same meaning; go dlistinach rightly 4; a meid andlistinaigh in unright, unreasonable quantity 4.

Doimne depth, an Abstract Noun from domhann, G. domhain deep Welsh dwfn and Breton don; oir cuiridh na súile an doimne ro-mór for it will put the eyes into a very great depth—it will cause them to sink in their sockets 19.

[TD 102]

Drageta, a kind of comfit in which the drug is covered by sugar, chocolate, or gelatine. It is the Fr. Dragée of the present day.

Dragma, the Gk. δραχμή used here in quite the modern sense of sixty minims or three scruples 28.

Droch bad, evil, W. drwg, Corn. drog. Like a few other old Adjectives it always stands before the Noun as droch-dhuine a bad man, droch-bheairt an evil deed; na h’éin do niter do droch róstadh the birds that are badly roasted 24; lucht an droch fhollamhnuighi those of bad rule or evil conduct 17.

Drong a people, certain people, of same meaning and perhaps of the same origin as G. dream akin to Gk. δράγμα a handful—of people; bidh drong ann ... ocus drong ele ... ocus drong ele there are some people ... and other people ... and others 18.

Duibh Gen. of dubh black; lucht lenna duibh those of black humors 25. See Leann. This is the same “humoral” idea as has come down to us in the word melancholia, μελαγχολία from μέλας black + χωλή bile.—Note, Col. 25.

Dúinte is from dúin shut, close up, the old idea of “strictum” as against “laxum,” the idea being that certain foods caused a closing up of the bodily “pores” and so brought about an unhealthy state; dúinte isna taobhaibh constriction in the sides 14; am biadh améid andlistinaigh do ní dúinte food in unreasonable quantity will cause constriction 4.

E

Ealaidh skill, art, science; teagaisgidh an ealadha leighis “medicina docet” the means of cure teaches 14—that is, a good inference as to the cause may be drawn from what cures the disease—quite correct; glantur an t’aer go

[TD 103]

h’ealadhanach the air is cleansed scientifically “secundum artem” 27.

Eanbruithi, G. eanaraich, soup, broth. This word has been a trouble to me for many a long day, and it has been a trouble to others. The form én bruith, which is so common in the older language, has always led me to think that there was a bird én in it, philologically at any rate. The late Dr. Macbain thought it was from ín + bruithe “in-boiled.” Cormack’s Glossary and O’Clery would make it from én water + bruithe boiled, and the late Whitley Stokes under the word enghlas grey water or thin gruel or milk and water, would point the same way. In this text it always means soup or broth; gidhedh foghnuidh eanbruithi na písi nevertheless the soup of pease will suffice 23.

Édagh, G. Aodach clothes, cloth; ocus cluthur le h’édach gomaith e and let him be well covered with clothes 13.

Edluis, “raritas” 15. I cannot give an English equivalent.

Egla, G. eagal fear, is éu-gal = ex-gal, wanting or void of valour or courage; ar egla na fellsamh ele for fear of the other philosophers 28. The concept of manliness and courage in the Gaelic language is indeed very interesting. The positive element is the right and natural factor in character always. The defect is always “non” or “ex.” It was never there, or it has disappeared.

Égmais, G. eugmhais, as eugmhais without. The word essentially means want, defect, and Dr. Macbain is perhaps not very far wrong when he suggests that the word is eu + comas “non-power” which is really want and defect. Teid an dimaoinus gach ní dibh so an égmais an misuir all of these things will go into foolishness without the temperance or abstemiousness 26.

Égnaidh Adj. from éagna wisdom; dlighi in duine égnaidhi a caomhna fein ar fhín it becomes the wise man to spare himself of wine 6, “sapiens debet sibi prohibere vinum bibat.”

W. angen; na do meadon eigniughadh “nec cogere uentrem” nor to force your middle, i.e. belly 15; na h’éignigh goláidir do shuigi do not forcefully compel thy seat, that is, thy bowel—do not force it 6, “nec cogas fortiter anum” 26; o aon gnodugh éigentach eile

[TD 104]

from one another (any) necessary cause 16; égintus innfhuartha in croidi, the necessity for the coolness of the heart 4.

Eile, eili and ele other, another, W. aill, Bret. eil, Lat. alius, Gk. ἄλλος, Old Gaulish allo—as in Cæsar’s Allobrogi; naid leanda ele than other fluids 20; na nech eile than another person 20; do biadhuibh eile of other foods 20; ocus ataid fersadha eili ar an fíon and there are other verses upon the wine 26.

Eireochas from eirghim I rise, G. eirichim, Lat. ērigo, Eng. erect; intán eireochas neach when a person rises—in the morning 9; oir eirighitt na dhetaighi inmholta for it will rise in undesirable fumes 5—Note.

Éis footstep, trace, death. The essential meaning is not clear. The word now only remains in composite forms as daéis after and taréis after also, but with different Preps. do and tar = “trans,” the latter having a feeling of motion in it.

Én a bird, G. eun, W. etn, edn, Br. ezn, all from an old root pet fly; na h’éin do niter do droch rósdadh the birds that are badly roasted 24; gaile an éin renaburthar struccio the stomach of the bird named Struthios 2.

Én one mod. aon; baindi ocus iasg ar én bórd milk and fish upon the one (same) table 12; na gabhthur ... én ní diureticach take not (any) one diuretic thing 12; saor in gach én ní free in each one thing—in every respect 17; oir ni fuil én ní coimedus nech ar eslaintibh for there is not (any) one thing which (fore) sees a person against diseases—better than blood-letting 21; ar én cor for (any) one reason 14; na caithid ar én cor iad let them not for any reason use them 23; én raod any part, lit. one thing 23; o aon gnodugh from one cause 16; an éinecht in one time 10—for én and old fecht time; ocus én uair amhain and one time only 20; ocus is don milsi oenda tuighter sin and it is of the united (single, simple) sweetness this is to be understood 19; ar énchuid at one meal 10.

Eochair a key; G. iuchair, W. egoriad “the opening thing” eochair gach uile eolais the key of all knowledge—Hippocrates 28.

Eoin Baisti (Féil); um fhéil eoin baisti about the feast of John Baptist—Midsummer Day, June 24th.

Eolas knowledge; eochair gach uile eólais Ippocras the key of

[TD 105]

all knowledge Hippocrates 28; ocus ro[f]urail eolus ocus aithi báis and he commanded (sought out) the knowledge and time of death 28.

Errach Spring, G. earrach. This word seems based upon the old Keltic concept of the year. The Céitein, the month of May, has its best rendering as the cét-ain or “first-time” of the year. The earr-ach would then naturally be the “tail-end” as we have it in earr-ball the tail or end member; sa geimredh ocus san errach in the Winter and in the Spring 15—see errannaibh.

Errannaibh from err a tail, G. earr—which we have in ear-ball tail-piece, really from air after ∴ the after-member; isi nan errannaibh is ferr no is millsi na h’éisg ocus na mná “pisces et mulieres sunt in caudis meliores uel dulciores” 18; is fuar in t’iasg in an err fish is cold in the tail 18.

Esbhuigh want, defect; G. easbhaidh from or akin to ex + bi “to be out of”; tre esbhuigh an indfhuara through the absence (or want) of the coolness 4.

Espartan twilight. Simply the Lat. Vespertana, G. feasgar; roimh an teirt ocus an uair na h’espartan before sunrise (rather the third hour) and in the twilight 16.


F

Fadhó is the Prep. fa + dhó = twice; is ferr began do caithimh fadhó it is better to use a little twice 4; fadhó no fathrí san aimsir cetna twice or three times in the same period 15.

Fásgadh wringing, squeezing; nach maith fásgadh eigneach do denamh nor (is it) good to make an imperative squeezing 15; arna mberbadh ocus arna fásgadh after being boiled and squeezed—through cloth 23.

Fastaighter from fastinghim I stop, stay, retain; na fastaíghter ar én cor iad and let them not be retained for any reason 14.

Feaghadh seeing, observing—see aithfeaghadh re-seeing, compensation 3, 21.

Fecht a time; began dotabhairt an ein[fh]echt a little given at one time 16; ocus ni gabhdhaois biadha examhla an éinfheacht and do not take “exemplary” foods at one time—exsamhla here seems to have an excessive or exceptional meaning. This old word remains in G. hidden in fathast yet and in am feasda forever, the one being fo-fecht-sa “sub hoc tempus” and the other in-fecht-sa “from this time forward”; oir in biadh caither an einfhecht a meid móir ni h’éidir a dileaghadh for the food taken in large quantity at one time cannot be digested 4.

Féchuin to examine, see, try; dleghur aimsir na bliadhna do féchuin it is necessary to examine the season of the year 15; dlighear na neithisi d’fheuchain it is right to try (or examine) these things 3.

Fédfuighi from feudfaighim I can, must, am permitted; ni(fh)éidir no ni h’urusa it is not necessary nor easy 10; ocus o nach féduruis since you dare not 10; ni feduit they must not 25.

Feradh excrement; indarbur an fual ocus in feradh let the urine and the faeces be expelled 14; in feradh fadhó no fathrí san aimsir cétna and defecation twice or three times in the same period; gan claochlogh do beith ar in fual na ar in feradh without change being upon the urine or the excrement 4.

Fineal fennel; ocus do bharr fhineil and of the tops of fennel 23.

Fiond white; lucht lenna fiond those of white (or pale) humors 25.

Fírindecha truthful; mar do chuala o daoinibh fírindecha as I have heard from truthful men 12; antan bis an

[TD 108]

t’ocarus fírinnech ann in the time when real (truthful) hunger is there 16.

Fis knowledge; dlighear a fhis fós and you should know also, 21, 24.

Fithett, G. fichead twenty, W. ugeint, Corn. ugens, Bret. ugent, Lat. viginti; it occurs several times at end of Col. 20.

Fiuchach from fiuchaim I boil; croccan fiuchach a fiuchadh in t’uisgi. Croccan G. crogan is an earthen vessel. The expression here seems to mean a burnt earthen vessel in which the water is boiled 8.

Flichadacht wet-ness, moist-ness, from fliuch wet Lat. liquidus; ag dul a tesoighect ocus a bflichadacht going into heat and in moistness, 16; na neithi flichada the moist things 24; oir ge flichadhi na neithi róstuighi for though the roasted things are moister 24.

Fodhailter from fodhailim I divide; gidheadh is an dá rannuibh fhodhailter aimsir na bliadhna yet (or nevertheless) it is in two portions that the seasons of the year are divided 21.

Foghmhar Autumn. The name seems to be fo + gamur “sub hiemem” the under-winter; do beirid toirrthi an foghmhair caoinedh dermair duit Autumn fruit will give thee sore weeping 16.

Fóghnuidh it will suffice; ocus fóghnuidh an aghaidh an rema fhuar and it will suffice against the cold rheum 26; et is mór fhoghnus fothrugadh uisgi milis and greatly will suffice (the) bathing in sweet water 14.

Follain healthy for fo + shlán “under wholeness,” an extremely fine expression; ocus is amhlaidh is follaine iat and it is so that they are the more healthy 22; mad áil let beith fallain if you wish to be healthy 25. From slán whole comes sláinte health which is, and means wholeness; and even holiness is but an extension of the idea into the higher aspects of life. The Saviour is magnificently called Slánuigher the giver of wholeness—“sanator,” and not “salvator” as other languages have it. To be follain G. fallain is to be enveloped in health as with a garment. Eu-slán and eu-sláinte is ex-health, disease, “broken” wholeness, in the truest and most real sense. No science can ever over-pass the perfect life-wisdom in these old words. The science which does not see, acknowledge, and accept this simple basic fact of human life is not science and we have no use for it.
It is a most valuable instruction to observe that the Gaelic language, in a fuller degree than perhaps any other tongue, expresses the attributes of manliness, health and courage in the positive form, and the defect of these, always, in the “ex-” form as being “out of” the natural state or condition. Eu-slaint is disease—“ex-health.” Eu-cáil is disease also but in lesser sense; it means out of condition. So also eu-dóchas out of or beyond hope, eu-coir out of or beyond justice, and many other similar expressions.
It may be mentioned that there is no word in Gaelic for a coward. The people who grew this language did not know the coward at all, but when in later days they unfortunately discovered him they called him gealtair or madman. This peculiar defect in the language is not perhaps more interesting than the way in which it was made good.
