’S FHADA THALL THA MISE

’S fhada, ’s fhada thall tha mise,
’S fhada thall bhon eilean àluinn,
Eilean àluinn snàmh ’san iar,
Ailleagan gu bràth ’nam chridh’.
’S fhada, ’s fhada thall tha mise.

Orasa nan tràighean grinneal,
Tràighean grinneal mìn gan sluaisreadh,
Stuadhantan ùr bho uchd a’ chuain
Bualadh fuaimneach mar o chionn.
Orasa nan tràighean grinneal.

’Sann ’nad thàmh a fhuair mi m’àrach,
Fhuair mi m’àrach òg is m’altrum.
Làithean samhraidh, maothach, blàth,
Casruisgt’ ruith mi taobh Loch Bàn.
’Sann ’nad thàmh a fhuair mi m’àrach.

’S truagh an-diugh an tìr nan Gall mi,
Tìr nan Gall is mi ’nam aonar;
Daoine coibhneil air gach taobh,
Ach ’se Beurla th’air gach beul.
’S truagh an-diugh an tìr nan Gall mi.

LAITHEAN M’OIGE LE M’ATHAIR

An-diugh ’s mi ’nam dhuine gur tric bhios mi smuain
Air m’òige le m’athair ’san eilean bheag uain’,
Làithean làn sòlais, làn mire, gun ghruaim –
Gun tog e mo chridhe bhith rithist ’gan cuimhn’.

Gur tric leis, ’s mi ’m bhalach, a chaidh sinn gu tràigh,
A thrusadh nam maorach aig ìsle muir-làin.
Bhiodh giomach am faiche neo leòbag ’san t-sàil,
Is mise bhiodh bròdail am faotainn ’nam làimh.

Ghiùlaininn iad dhachaidh le farum ’nam cheum,
Gun smuain air luchd saoghalta le mì-rùn no eud;
An lòn air a thrusadh le tapachd nam meur
Gur mìls’ e na cuirm a tha ceannaicht’ gu léir.

B’e a mhiann anns an t-samhradh am bàt’ chur air sàil,
Is shuidhinn gu sona leis cùlaibh nan ràmh;
Gu Caolas na Caillich gu siùbhlach i snàmh,
Far an slatadh sinn piocach is rionnach no dhà.

Gur ioma nì prìseil a sheall sinn air cuan:
Ròin bheaga mar chaoraich air creig, ’s iad ’nan suain;
Sgarbh dubh, an sàr-iasgair, a’ sgrùdadh ’sna tuinn,
Is sgàireag nan creag le sgread os ar cionn.

Ged thigeadh dubhadh air speuran le iomairt nan neòil,
Is sioban thar thonnan a fhliuchadh an seòl,
Cha bhiodh e fo chùram nan seasadh na ròp’.
B’e coisir ’na chluais a bhith ’g éisdeachd an ceòl.

Duine bha coibhneil, suairc agus còir,
Dìcheallach, iriosal, uasal ’na dhòigh,
Gun fhòirneart ’na shùilean no breug air a bheòil,
Càirdeil is sunndach ri sean agus òg.

MO CHARAID BALBH
(Cù an t-Sealgair)

Gu sunndach dh’fhalbhamaid ri moch is anmoch,
Ri gaoith ’s ri uisge ’s ri fèath nan eun,
An gunna dùbailt’ gu h-aotrom giùlan,
’S tu fhéin a’ rùrach a h-uile ceum.

Thar chnoc is bhacan, troimh ghleann is ghlacan,
Gu cladach stacach a’ Chuain an Iar,
Gun d’rinn sinn faothach air latha gaothach,
Bhith ’n Rubh’ nam Faoileann gum b’e ar miann.

Air Carraig Ghrùdair gu robh thu lùthmhor,
Is iomadh fùdar a loisg sinn ann,
Is bha thu siùbhlach air muir a’ giùlan,
Ged bhiodh an srùthladh ’gad fheuchainn teann.

Air Rubh’ nan Crann-lach air feasgar geamhraidh,
Na stuadhantan gorm-gheal a’ lùbadh crom,
Gun d’shuidh sinn sàmhach a’ feitheamh eunlaith,
Ar miann ’s ar dòchas an t-eallach trom.

An ùig dhìonach ri frasan dìleach,
’S a’ ghaoth a’ bìgeil am measg nam fròg,
Gun d’leig sinn sgìos dhinn gu ’n d’mhùth an t-sìde,
Is rinn thu sìneadh ri m’thaobh gu còir.

An déidh a’ chruadail gun tig am fuasgladh,
Ged ’s mór an cruaidh-chàs, thig sìth ’na dhéidh.
An tonn ’sa gheamhradh a thig le gleadhraich,
Gun tig ’san t-samhradh ’na chuairteig réidh.

Taobh lochan feurach air feasgar samhraidh,
A’ ghealach oirdhearc a’ streap an àird,
Gum b’e ar sùgradh bhith ’g éisdeachd ùinich
Nan lachainn siùbhlach a’ tighinn thar sàil.

’San àird a deas oirnn an rionnag-fheasgair
Le meuran dealrach a’ danns’ ’san speur.
’Se sealladh àluinn, i fhéin ’s a càirdean,
Cur solus bàidheil mun t-saoghal gu léir.

Nam feumadh pàigheadh ’son h-uile àilleachd
A tha mar ìocshlàint ’sa chruinne-cé,
Gum biodh sinn bròdail le toll ’nar pòcaid.
An còta spòrsail, nach e tha faoin!

Gum fac’ sinn còmhla gach nì a chòrd rinn,
Nuair rinn sinn cuairteachd measg chnoc is ghleann,
An lach le teaghlach a’ snàmh gu h-aotrom,
’S gach lus is flùr a tha còmhdach blàr.

A’ seall’ mun cuairt oirnn ’se camar-inntinn
A th’ann bhith smuaintinn cà’ bheil ar tùr;
A’ phìob a ghleus E, an Cruithear fhéin, dhuinn,
Thig ceòl glé bhinn aist’ gun ribheid ùr.

A charaid dhìlis, tha a-nis gach mìos
A’ toirt luaidh le innseadh air crìoch do là.
Na cluas’ bha dìreach an-diugh cha dìrich,
’S tha mala liath mu do shùilean blàth.

Nuair thig an t-ám is gur fheudar dealachadh,
Ar cuideachd shunndach ’san t-saoghal seo réidh,
An lagan uaine gun tagh mi uaigh dhuit,
Far ’m bi thu suaimhneach fo sgàile sgéith.

SRUTHAN TEAMPULL A’ GHLINNE

A shruthain bhig, á gleanntan do bhalbhag bheir smuain
Air gach cùis a dh’atharraich bhon chiad là ruith thu nuas;
Bho’n fhliuch thu teanga thioram Draoidh a streap do bhruthach suas,
Gu ’n latha an-diugh ’s tu fuarachadh mo charbad-rothach luath.

Mu fhichead slat bho d’ bhruachan, an àit’ le fois is sìth,
Thog Calum Cille teampull air a thurus tuath gu I.
Tha sin a-nis ’na làrach, le crotal air gach clach,
’S gun nì mar bha ach d’ bhorbhan ’s mac-tall’ nan creagan glas.

Mu’n d’ chuir thu chiad car lùbach tha cnocan air mhór-sgeul,
Far robh cinn-cinnidh ainmeil len gadhair riobach nan sròn geur.
A-nis tha froineach àrd ann a shaltaireadh mo cheum,
’S na blàran a bha uaine fo ghiobarsaich gun fheum.

A’ tèarnadh suas do ghleanntan moch maduinn chiùin le spréidh,
Fo m’ chasan rathad cruaidh le teàrr far an dòcha ruith thu fhéin,
Mo smuain gur ioma h-aon chaidh seach le sùilean fliuch le deur,
A dh’fhàgail caraid anns a’ chill an Orasa gu sèimh.

An fheannag ghlas, an croman ruadh, is fitheach dubh nan speur,
Gum fliuch iad gob ’nad uisge mun éirich a’ chiad reul.
An dreathan beag le ribheid bhinn, ’s i gleusda suas ’ga mhiann,
Gum faigh e fasgadh mu do bhruach far ’m paisg e cheann fo sgiath.

Dol seachad sìos an teampull ’nam charbad thoiteach ùr:
Glé mhath i mar tha cabhag orm, ach bho m’ chasan bheir i lùth;
Glé mhath i mar tha ùilleadh innt’, ’s gun sàbhail i mo cheum,
Ach gun d’uisg’ ’ga fuarachadh, stadaidh i gun fheum.

Tràth latha anns an t-samhradh tha fàileadh cùbhraidh leum
Bho gach lus ma d’ bhruachan, is drùchd a’ fàgail fraoich.
Tha ’n uiseag ’s i a’ seinn dhomh, ag aotromach’ mo cheum,
’S measg roiteagach tha snàthainn an damhain-eallaich ghleusd’.

A shruthain bhig, mo thaing dhuit ’son t’uisge blasda fuar,
A chaisg mo phathadh, ’s mi ’nam bhalach, cleasachd mu do bhruaich.
Mo ladhran fhuair iad faochadh ’nad lùbagan beag ruadh;
Casruisgte b’e mo mhiann-sa seach brògan sleamhainn cruaidh.

Tha a h-uile nì air atharrachadh, an seo is anns gach tìr,
Cuid bheir math, cuid bheir dona — a bheil fios có tha fìor?
Chan eil mi nis cho aosda no cho òg ’s nach fhac’ mi fhéin
Daoine bha cridheil toilicht’ le glé bheagan ach an gnìomh.

An-diugh gum feum sinn rothair, mar ’s luaith e ’sann as fhèarr,
Taigh grinn le h-uile àsaig, mar ’s daoir iad ’sann as fhèarr.
’N àit’ pìob is sgeul is òrain, fidheall agus rann,
Tha daoin’ ’nan suidhe sàmhach mu choinneamh bogsa-dhealbh.

AN T-IASGAIR 
(Togail nan Cliabh)

Gur aotrom mo cheum-sa ’s mi dèanadh gu bàt’,
An uiseag gu sunndach cur fàilt’ air an là.
Ma gheibh mi fo astar ri àirde muir-làin,
Thig buille ’san t-sruth chuireas siubhal ’na sàil.

Gur iomadach sealladh a chì mi air cuan:
Ròin bheaga mar chaoraich air creig ’s iad ’nan suain;
Sgarbh dubh, an sàr-iasgair, a’ sgrùdadh ’sna tuinn,
Is sgàireag na creig’ a’ toirt m’òige ’nam chuimhn’.

Gur tric ’s mi ’nam bhalach a streap mi na drèis,
A’ rùrach a h-uighean, ’s mo chridhe air leum,
Mo ladhran am fruchag, is m’ìnean an gréim,
Sgread fhaoileann a’ lìonadh mo chlaisteachd gu léir.

Tha callag bheag dhìleas bhios daonnan ’nam chomhair,
Gu faicilleach, dìcheallach trusadh a lòn.
Mar rionnag a’ tuiteam, ’s i dèarrsadh mar òr,
Le spairt air an uisg’ thig an t-eun-sgadain mór.

Ann an Caolas na Caillich bidh sruth mar as miann,
An Dubh Hirteach ’na sheasadh air faire ’san iar.
Ma gheibh mi an Dubh-sgeir air càrn na Beinn Riabhaich,
Cha bhi mise falamh mar thogas mi cliabh.

Ged thig dubhadh air speuran le iomairt nan neòil,
Is sioban thar thonnan a fhliuchas an seòl,
Cha bhi mi fo chùram ma sheasas na ròp’;
’Se coisir ’nam chluais a bhith ’g éisdeachd an ceòil.

AN CEARDAMAN

Chaidh Eòghan do dh’Uibhist latha féill;
B’e a dhùil gum faigheadh e aighean ann.
Cho math ri aighean fhuair e gréim
Air daolag-dhubh — an cèardaman.

’San eilean bheag sin bha e tàmh,
’S le fuaim gun d’rinn e itealaich
Feadh thoman riabhach nam beann àrd,
Gus an d’fhuair Eòghan a’ Ghlinne e.

Mu’n chèardaman tha mi fo phràmh.
O Eòghain! Carson a thog thu e?
B’e a mhiann bhith cleasachd air an làr
An Uibhist far an d’rugadh e.

Seo cagar, Eòghain, a-nis ’nad chluais:
An creutair bochd, nan d’fhàg thu e!
Di-Sathurna cha bhi e slàn,
Ma gheibh mi air bàrr a’ ghunna e!


Freagairt a’ Chèardamain
(le Eòghan a’ Ghlinne)

Seo, a Dhòmhnaill a cheist, do charaid,
Cèardaman féill Uibhist.
Taing mhór airson do rabhaidh.
’S math dh’fhaodadh gu bheil thu de’n bharail
Gur tusa an <eng>greatest<gai> fhathast.
Ach éisd rium, a charaid:
Tha mise <eng>too beautiful to beat!<gai>

Rabhadh

Eisd rium, Eòghain, is thoir an aire:
Tha mi deas a dhol gu bàillidh,
Gunna dùbailt’ ann am m’asgaill,
Deas a losgadh fùdar.

Nuair a théid mi mach air stann,
Bidh tu, Eòghain, a’ fàs car fann,
Calmain ’nam frois ma d’cheann,
’S gach aon dhiubh ’na smùrach.

Latha fèath no latha fiadhaich,
Calmain on ear no ’n iar,
Le sùil mar iolair air a sgiath,
Gun cuir mi iad ’nan spruileach.

Gun cum mi riut a h-aon ’s a dhà.
An trì ’s an ceithir thig iad gu làr,
Ach ann an cóig cha bhi iad slàn,
Chionn ’s mise, Eòghain, an greatest!


Freagairt do Rabhadh 
(le Eòghan a’ Ghlinne)

A Dhomhnaill MhicNèill, a chrìosdaidh,
Feumaidh mise innse
Gu bheil thu math air sgrìobhadh is bàrdachd,
Ach ma gheibh ‘Cèardaman Chill Odhrain’
A ghunna ri a ghualainn,
Chan eil eagal aig’ ro bhàrd no ro bhàillidh.

Na biodh tusa, a chreutair, a’ bruadar
Mu ‘chupan mór’ ’s mu dhuaisean,
Chionn tha mise h-uile cinnteach, mu fàg mi,
Gun tig an cupan do Chill Odhrain am bliadhna mar is àbhaist.
’Sann air dràran Shandaidh Ghreusaiche tha àite-còmhnaidh.

’S mise Murchadh Ruadh am posta,
Fear-liobhairt mail na dùthcha.
’Se ’n cudthrom tha ’sa mhàileid seo
A dh’fhàg mo chnàmhan brùite.

Bidh iasg a’ dol do Ghlaschu,
Is partanan is crùbain;
Bidh siùcar ’s tì ’s tombaca,
Is rudan beag don bhùth ann.

Bidh mi sin a’ dol don Ghlasaird
Le oranges is ùbhlan,
’S bidh coupon ann do Dhòmhnall MacLeòid –
Tha sùil aig’ ris na thoosands!

Bidh pige ann is dileagan
Gheibh ’m ministear a-nall ann.
Bithidh snaoisean ann don mhaighstir-sgoil,
Is leggings do John Dhùghaill ann.

Bidh skirt do Sheònaid Gheaspair ann,
Is maitseachan do Ruairidh.
Bithidh cupan, teapot, ’s panachan,
Is kettle do bhean Dhùghaill ann.

Cha téid mi do na Machairean
(Tha eagal orm ron chù ann!)
Ach bheir mi na mails do Dhoshie
Ma chì mi a-mach ’sa chùirt e.

Their Anna Gheaspair, le glag gàir’,

’S an sin a bhitheas an ùbaraid:

Feuch càit a bheil na screw-tops.

Ach feumaidh mi falbh, tha cabhag orm,
Le C.O.D. do dh’Uisdean,
’S mun till mi nall ás Uragaig
Bidh Jeannie a-mach ’gam rùdhrach.

Nuair a ruigeas mi MacArtair
Cha bhi am pac cho bùcail.
Bidh iadsan ’s cupan deas dhomh,
Ach mo thruaigh! cha bhi ùin’ air.

Agus sin agaibh cuid de na trioblaidean

NOTES
Poems by Donald MacNeill

’S Fhada Thall Tha Mise (Far Away am I)

A song of longing for Donald’s native Oronsay. This type of nostalgic poem is extremely common in Gaelic tradition, especially among Gaels who were forcibly exiled to distant parts of the world following the Clearances of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Donald’s case the exile was to prove only temporary.

v. 2, l. 1 <gai>Orasa nan tràighean grinneal.<eng> Anyone who has visited Oronsay will know that its coastline consists largely of the most stupendous, and deserted, sandy beaches.

v. 3, l. 3 <gai>Loch Bàn.<eng> Flora and Andrew Macneill, Donald’s sister and brother-in-law who farmed on Oronsay for many years, suggested that this might be Loch an Eala Bhàin, near the southern end of Oronsay.

v. 4, l. 1 <gai>tìr nan Gall.<eng> A Gall, as opposed to a Gaidheal, is a non-Gaelic speaker, hence Donald’s reference to English being on every tongue.


Làithean m’Oige le m’Athair (Boyhood Days with my Father)

A touching recollection of Donald’s father Malcolm MacNeill (1881-1949), known locally as Calum Orasa, who was the tenant farmer of Oronsay in the first half of the twentieth century. It is a nostalgic, no doubt highly selective evocation of long summer days spent on the shore, and fishing around the coastline. Verses 5 and 6 are echoed in An t-Iasgair (q.v.)

v. 2, l. 3 <gai>leòbag ’san t-sàil,<eng> i.e. in the salt-water pools left by the receding tide.

v. 4, l. 3 <gai>Caolas na Caillich.<eng> “The old woman’s narrows”, at the western end of An Dubh-eilean, below the farm on Oronsay.

v. 5, l. 2 <gai>ròin bheaga mar chaoraich.<eng> Donald’s MS has charach, subsequently corrected to chorcach. Corcach could be intended as a reference to the water-bull, one of the creatures of Celtic myth and legend. But the simile of sheep

[TD 54]

is an apt, and a more down-to-earth, reading.

v. 5, l. 3 <gai>sgarbh dubh.<eng> A sgarbh can be either a cormorant or a shag. A “black cormorant” is a shag, which lacks the white face of the true cormorant.


Mo Charaid Balbh (My Dumb Friend)

This affectionate ode to his elderly collie bitch Di is one of Donald’s most effective poems. It tellingly evokes the close understanding between man and animal on which successful hill farming depends. Donald’s daughter Kate recalls that one of Di’s tricks was to go off and round up the sheep on her own, without any instruction, when it was time for dipping or some such vital operation. Significantly, however, what is recalled here is not the long days spent gathering sheep or cattle from the hill, but the times spent alone together in sport and recreation.

Under its later title Cù an t-Sealgair (The Shooter’s Dog), this poem was submitted by Donald as his entry for the Bardic Crown at the National Mòd of An Comunn Gaidhealach, coming a close second to a piece by Norman Maclean.

The ordering of the verses differs radically in Donald’s two “fair copy” MSS. MS1 (longhand) has the order as followed in this edition, but omits v. 4. MS2 (partly typed) originally contained only vv. 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 12, and 13, but 8, 9, 10 and 4 have subsequently been added in longhand, and the numbering altered to read 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, omitting v. 11. The arrangement as printed has been chosen as giving the best sequence in terms of content, and reflects the order of MS1 with the addition of v. 4.

v. 1, l. 1 <gai>ri moch is anmoch.<eng> This line supplies the title for the present collection.

v. 1, l. 2 <gai>fèath nan eun.<eng> Literally “the calm of the birds”, prefiguring the references to birds later in the poem.

v. 2, l. 4 <gai>Rubha nam Faoileann.<eng> “The seagulls’ point”. This name does not appear on any map, but could be a reference to the western extremity of Garvard, where there is a reef known as Sgeir nam Faoileann.

v. 3, l. 1 <gai>Carraig a’ Ghrùdair.<eng> “The brewer’s fishing-rock”. Carraig Mhic a’ Ghrùdair, where Donald used to go shooting duck, is at the western end of the Ardskenish peninsula.

[TD 55]

v. 3, l. 3 <gai>bha thu siùbhlach air muir a’ giùlan.<eng> Retrieving shot birds (or anything else) from the water was apparently one of Di’s specialities.

v. 4, l. 1 <gai>Rubha nan Crann-lach.<eng> “The teals’ point”. Local sources have failed to identify where this is, although Donald’s daughter Kate thought it might be in the same area as Rubha nam Faoileann (see above). An early MS version has Rubha Trearach, which suggests the eastern extremity of Oronsay. This is shown as Eilean Treadhrach on the O.S. map, although it is in fact a headland, not an island.

v. 13, l.4 <gai>fo sgàile sgéith.<eng> A reference to Psalm 17, v. 8: “Hide me under the shadow of thy wings”.


Sruthan Teampull a’ Ghlinne (The Temple Burn)

In this poem Donald draws his inspiration from the small stream that flows down the glen leading to the Strand crossing to Oronsay. The burn, which lies within the confines of Garvard Farm, where Donald lived, runs beside the road for much of its length, hence the references to Donald’s car. He is clearly struck by a sense of history, as he ponders the changes that have swept by as the unchangeable burn continues to flow.

v. 1, l. 3 <gai>Draoidh.<eng> The Druids were the priests and scholars of the old Celtic cult of nature. Donald imagines one of their number making his way up the glen, and stopping to refresh himself from the stream. There may be a reference here to the remains of ancient settlements on Beinn Airnicil.

v. 1, l. 4 <gai>mo charbad-rothach.<eng> A rather high-flown Gaelic expression for a motor-car, literally a “wheeled vehicle”.

v. 2, l. 2 <gai>Calum Cille.<eng> Known in his native Ireland as Colm Cille (“Dove of the Church”), and in Scotland by the Latinised version of his name, St Columba sailed to self-imposed exile on Iona in 563, and from thence began the evangelisation of Scotland. A persistent local tradition, not substantiated from historical sources, has it that he landed first on Colonsay, at Port na h-Iùbhrach on Garvard Farm, and founded the original monastic settlement on Oronsay, before discovering that under exceptionally favourable weather conditions, the hills of his native Donegal, which he had vowed never to see again, were still visible on the horizon. As a result of this discovery, the saint felt he must sail on further, and so Iona, and not Oronsay, became the cradle of Christianity in Scotland.

[TD 56]

v. 2, l. 2 <gai>teampull.<eng> The word is used of a small chapel such as the one described here, which according to local tradition was founded by Columba, although the surviving ruins, which essentially comprise part of the north and south walls and the base of the altar, must date from several hundred years after Columba’s time. According to the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Scotland (Argyll, Vol.5, no. 390), “the chapel may tentatively be attributed to the 14th century”.

v. 2, l. 3 <gai>crotal.<eng> Although it can refer to any lichen, the Gaelic word is habitually used for reddish-brown dyes derived from lichen, which were traditionally employed in the manufacture of tweed.

v. 3, l. 2 <gai>cinn-cinnidh ainmeil.<eng> Donald is probably thinking of the many hilltop forts (dùintean) dotted around Colonsay, such as Dùn Cholla, just to the east of the Temple Glen, or somewhat further away Dùn Eibhinn, which was the main stronghold of the MacPhee chiefs in the Middle Ages.

v. 3, l. 2 <gai>gadhair riobach nan sròn geur.<eng> It is tempting to see this as a reference to Dùnan nan Con, the “little fort of the dogs”, which stands near the top end of the Temple Glen. Donald himself told Kevin Byrne that the chief Colla Uais, a kinsman of Columba, was supposed to have used Dùn Cholla as a hunting lodge, and to have kept his hounds at nearby Dùnan nan Con.

v. 4, l. 2 <gai>rathad cruaidh far an dòcha ruith thu fhéin.<eng> The burn for part of its length forms a ditch alongside the road, which has probably been built over its original course.

v. 4, l. 4 <gai>a’ chill an Orasa.<eng> Oronsay Priory was in medieval times a favoured burying-place for Hebridean notables (hence its outstanding collection of memorial slabs), and continued in use as a cemetery until well into the nineteenth century, with occasional more recent burials.

v. 5, l. 1 <gai>an croman ruadh.<eng> Strictly speaking, a croman is a kite, but the word is used on Colonsay for a buzzard, of which there is a large resident population.

v. 5, l. 3 <gai>an dreathan beag.<eng> “Jenny Wren” she may be in English, but in Gaelic wrens are masculine!

v. 6, ll. 2, 3 <gai>mar.<eng> This colloquial form is regularly used on Colonsay for nuair.

v. 7, l. 4 <gai>roiteagach.<eng> Donald’s MS has froiteagach, which is felt by other native speakers to be a mistake. There may be some confusion arising from the way the letter f is lenited (“aspirated”) to become silent, or an analogy with the alternatives roineach/froineach , meaning “bracken”.

v. 8, l. 4 <gai>casruisgte.<eng> It comes as something of a surprise to be reminded that in

[TD 57]

Donald’s boyhood in the 1930s, running barefoot was the norm, and the preferred norm at that, for Highland youngsters. Cf. ’S Fhada Thall Tha Mise, v. 3, l. 4.

v.10, l.4 <gai>bogsa-dhealbh.<eng> A disparaging reference to the now ubiquitous television set, which Donald sees as having displaced more traditional forms of entertainment. Donald was himself proficient on the pipe and chanter, and excelled as a singer, storyteller and of course as a poet. But it is worth recalling that towards the end of his life he played a cameo role as the Laird of Raasay in a television film about Johnson and Boswell’s tour of the Hebrides, speaking both in English and in Gaelic.


An t-Iasgair (The Fisherman)

Subtitled Togail nan Cliabh (Lifting the Creels), this poem is a happy evocation of fishing for lobsters off the coast of Colonsay and Oronsay. Although in this instance the adult Donald seems to be alone, there are echoes in vv. 2 and 6 of times spent fishing with his father in Làithean m’Oige le m’Athair (q.v.).

v. 1, l. 3 <gai>ri àirde muir-làin.<eng> Life on Oronsay is dominated by the tides. Cf. “aig ìsle muir-làin” in Làithean m’Oige, v. 2, l. 2.

v. 2 <gai>See notes on Làithean m’Oige, v. 5. In line 2, mar chaoraich is in this case spelt chorach in both MS versions, but as in the other poem, this has been read as meaning “sheep”. In line 4, Donald subtly alters the line to provide a link to his reminiscences of boyhood in v. 3.

v. 4, l. 4 <gai>an t-eun-sgadain mór.<eng> Probably written thus to fit the metre. Eun mór an sgadain (“the great herring bird”) is a Gaelic designation for the gannet.

v. 5, l. 1 <gai>Caolas na Caillich.<eng> See note on Làithean m’Oige, v. 4, l. 3.

v. 5, l. 2 <gai>An Dubh Hirteach.<eng> The lighthouse which lies some 15 miles to the west of Colonsay serves as an important landmark on that side of the island. It often appears on maps as Dubh Artach, but the version given here corresponds to Colonsay usage.

v. 5, l. 3 <gai>An Dubh-sgeir.<eng> A reef off Ardskenish, here used as a marker to locate the sunken creels.

v. 5, l. 3 <gai>A’ Bheinn Riabhach.<eng> Shown on the O.S. map as Binnean Riabhach, this

[TD 58]

prominent hill stands to the west of Loch Fada, behind the crofts at Lower Kilchattan.

v. 6 Cf. Làithean m’Oige, v. 6. Donald here adopts as his own the thoughts attributed to his father in the other poem.


An Cèardaman (The Dung-beetle)

An exchange of messages in verse between Donald and his friend and neighbour Hugh Brown (Eoghan a’ Ghlinne). As the text makes clear, Hugh had been to a cattle sale in Uist, and had come back with more than he bargained for. However, it is the forthcoming shooting match, and the rivalry between the two men in connection with it, that dominates the exchanges.

Hugh Brown was for many years the manager at Kiloran Farm, when it served as the home farm for the Colonsay Estate. After Kiloran was let in the late 1960s he moved to Galloway, where he became the farm manager for the Kirkdale estate, but he retained the tenancy of Homefield, Gortain and Templefield crofts on Colonsay. With his wife Kirsty he retired to Colonsay in 1981 to live at Homefield. Kirsty died in 1985, and Hugh in 1990. From the references in the text, it is clear that these exchanges took place during Hugh’s tenure at Kiloran in the 1960s.

Colonsay Gun Club is an important institution on the island, with two major competitions a year and smaller shoots at other times. Rivalry between the leading contenders is usually fierce. Nowadays the contests take place on the Golf Course, at the head of Tràigh an Tobair Fhuair (Machrins Bay), but at the time described here they were held on the hillside behind the Hotel.


Freagairt a’ Chèardamain

l. 5, l. 7 an greatest; too beautiful to beat. The deliberate use of English heightens the humour, as Hugh consciously puts the boasts of heavy-weight boxing champion Cassius Clay (later Muhammed Ali) into the mouth of the dung-beetle. But the beetle is rapidly becoming a persona for Hugh himself.

[TD 59]

Rabhadh do dh’Eòghan a’ Ghlinne

v. 1, l. 2 <gai>bàillidh.<eng> The factor, or land agent, is a figure of great authority in those parts of the Highlands and Islands which are still dominated by large private estates, and in the past had the power of summary eviction. The factor at this time would have been Thomas Findlay.

v. 2, l. 3 <gai>calmain.<eng> Animal welfare activists may sleep easy in their beds. It is of course clay pigeons, not real ones, that are being shot to pieces.

v. 4, l. 4 an greatest. Donald takes up Hugh’s “Cassius Clay” taunt (see above) and returns it.


Freagairt do Rabhadh

l. 1 <gai>a chrìosdaidh.<eng> Literally, “Christian”.

l. 3 <gai>gu bheil thu math air sgrìobhadh is bàrdachd.<eng> Hugh generously acknowledges Donald’s talents as a poet, though not his proficiency as a marksman!

l. 4 <gai>Cèardaman Chill Odhrain.<eng> Hugh has by now adopted the dung-beetle as his own nom de guerre.

l. 13 <gai>Sandaidh Greusaiche.<eng> Sandy MacPhee was not himself a shoemaker but the son of a shoemaker, and lived latterly at Glassard. He is the same “Sendy” who appears in An t-Slat-Iasgaich (q.v.). Hugh and Kirsty had acquired a large quantity of his furniture when they moved into Kiloran Farm.


The Puppy Dog and the Pussy Cat

A simple little nursery rhyme, made up by Donald to amuse his children Kate and Pedie when they were small.

[TD 60]

Poems not composed by Donald MacNeill

The three remaining poems in the collection are not by Donald’s own hand, but were found together with his own compositions. They form part of the oral tradition of Colonsay, which flourished in the days before television made mass entertainment (in English) freely available on the island. In two cases it has been possible to identify the authors; An t-Achmhasan appears to be anonymous.


Murchadh Ruadh (Am Posta) – Red Murdoch (The Postman)

Written by Flora Margaret McNeill (‘Folalie’), with contributions from the late Ross Darroch, Flora Macneill (Donald’s sister), and Folalie’s late mother Margaret McNeill, this is an example of the kind of locally-based satirical ditty that was once common in most Gaelic-speaking communities. Deliberately poking fun at well-known local figures, they would be sung or recited to general amusement at ceilidhs and other island gatherings. Some of the humour derives from the way in which English words are interspersed, and in some cases made to rhyme with the Gaelic. From the references to individuals, it is possible to date the composition to around 1950.

It is possible to follow the postman’s progress around the island, starting in Scalasaig, with a diversion to Glassard, proceeding by way of Machrins, Kilchattan and Kiloran to Uragaig, and then wearily back again.

v. 1, l. 1 <gai>Murchadh Ruadh.<eng> Murdoch Morrison, known as Murchadh Ruadh on account of his red hair, was not a native of Colonsay, but worked in the Hotel for a time and also had the responsibility of delivering the mail. On Colonsay this is not a daily task, since even now mail arrives only three times a week; at the time the poem was written, the ‘steamer’ called only once a week in winter, and twice in summer. Murdoch Morrison subsequently joined the police force on the mainland.

v. 1, l. 3 <gai>an cudthrom tha ’sa mhàileid seo.<eng> Poor Murdoch did however have the luxury of a post van, supplied by David Clark at the Hotel.

v. 2, l. 2 <gai>partanan is crùbain.<eng> There is no single word in Gaelic for ‘crab’. A crùban is an Edible Crab, much prized as an item of diet on the island. Partanan

[TD 61]

refers to other, smaller species of crab, which are not eaten much locally but are exported to mainland markets.

v. 2, l. 4 <gai>don bhùth.<eng> At this time the shop would be in the corrugated iron ‘annexe’ to Hazel Cottage, above the pier, the house in which Folalie still lives with her sister Catriona and brother-in-law Finlay MacFadyen.

v. 3, l. 1 <gai>don Ghlasaird.<eng> The eight houses in Glassard, to the north of Scalasaig, were built in the early 1920s to re-house the people of Riasg Buidhe, further up the coast, whose homes were condemned as no longer adequate for twentieth-century living.

v. 3, l. 3 coupon… <gai>do Dhomhnall MacLeòid.<eng> Donald MacLeod, who lived in the end house in Glassard, was apparently a great devotee of the football pools. According to Folalie, he used to say that if he ever won, he would buy sweets for all the children on the island.

v. 3, l. 4 thoosands. An example of the way in which English, or in this case Scots, can be used to humorous effect in a Gaelic setting.

v. 4, l. 1 <gai>pige.<eng> A ‘pig’ was an earthenware bottle, some examples of which are displayed in the bar at the Colonsay Hotel. They were much used for warming beds, before the advent of rubber hot-water bottles.

v. 4, l. 1 <gai>am ministear.<eng> There is presumably a sly joke implied here, with the minister being the intended recipient of the bottle, and its contents. The incumbent at the time would be the Rev. John Y. Clark, who served the parish from 1943 until his death in 1952.

v. 4, l. 3 <gai>do’n mhaighstir-sgoil.<eng> The schoolmaster at the time would be Samuel McCaskie, whose father-in-law McIsaac was partial to snuff.

v. 4, l. 4 John Dhùghaill. John Clark, who worked Scalasaig Farm until 1997, as did his father Dugald before him.

v. 5, l. 1 <gai>Seonaid Gheaspair.<eng> Janet (‘Jessie’) McAllister, the daughter of Jasper Brown, and wife of Alastair (‘Aldy’) McAllister. They lived at Hill Cottage, the detached house in the middle of An t-Sràid Cham (Squint Street) which runs between the Hotel and Scalasaig Farm.

v. 5, l. 2 <gai>Ruairidh.<eng> Roger Macdonald, from Harris, was known as Ruairidh Hearach. He is remembered for wondering, when in his nineties, if he might get a job building the new pier in 1965.

v. 5, l. 4 <gai>bean Dhùghaill.<eng> Effie Clark, also from Harris, who was married to Dougie Clark, the farmer at Scalasaig.

v. 6, l. 3 Doshie. Duncan McNeill, the unmarried brother of Roger McNeill, who farmed at Machrins.

[TD 62]

v. 7, l. 1 <gai>Màiri an Tàilleir.<eng> Mary McAllister, the wife of Calum Coll McAllister (see below). Her grandfather was one of the island’s two tailors, an example of a local nickname persisting over three generations.

v. 7, l. 2 an stewpan. The rhyming of this with crùbain is one of the funniest points in the poem.

v. 7, l. 3 Calum. The son of Coll McAllister, who moved with his family from Riasg Buidhe to Glassard in 1922. Calum and his wife Mary (see above) lived at Gart a’ Ghobhainn, now known as Port Mór Cottage, between Machrins and Kilchattan.

v. 8, l. 1 <gai>Màiri Ghoirtein.<eng> Mary Martin, the daughter of Hector and Kate Martin, of Gortain croft in Upper Kilchattan, used to keep Murdoch supplied with goose eggs. Neither she nor any of her four brothers married, and she lived latterly with her last surviving brother Neil at Homefield until she died there at the age of 91.

v. 8, l. 3 <gai>Anna Gheaspair.<eng> The daughter of Jasper Brown, and mother of Hugh Brown who wrote the rejoinders in An Cèardaman (q.v.).

v. 9, l. 1 an exchange. The telephone exchange at the time was situated in Tòrr an Tuirc, now known as Mill Cottage, between the Baptist Manse and the Mill.

v. 9, l. 3 Davie. David Clark, the brother of Dougie who farmed at Scalasaig, ran the Colonsay Hotel with their sister Mary. A third brother, Donald, was master of the Dunara Castle.

v. 9, l. 4 na screw-tops. Screw-top bottles. Murdoch, whose regular job was in the hotel, would know where they had been put.

v.10, l.2 C.O.D. Cash on delivery.

v.10, l.2 <gai>Uisdean.<eng> Hugh Galbraith, who still lives at Kiloran with his wife Betty.

v.10, l.4 Jeannie. Jean McNeill, the postmistress, would be concerned about the safety of the mails.

v.11, l.1 <gai>MacArtair.<eng> The MacArthur family, who came originally from Mull and Scalpay, worked a croft at Uragaig, to the west of Kiloran Bay. Donald MacArthur still occupies the crofthouse, and two of his sisters are still resident on the island.

v.12, l.2 <gai>geata.<eng> Until motor vehicles became common on Colonsay, gates rather than cattle-grids separated the various farms. Hence the junction of the Oronsay road, west of Scalasaig, is still known as “the Black Gate”. Murdoch’s return journey to the Post Office would be punctuated by the need to get out of his van to open and close each gate as he came to it.

[TD 63]

An t-Slat-Iasgaich (The Fishing-rod)

Written by Alexander Darroch, the father of Ross Darroch who helped write Murchadh Ruadh. He was away at sea for much of his life, and his wife Maggie Thomson brought up their two sons and four daughters largely on her own in the cottage at Scalasaig that still bears her name. Their grand-daughter Margaret still lives on Colonsay.

This is another example of local satire, where much of the humour lies in the references to individuals, in this case Sandy Greusaiche MacPhee and his wife Grace, who was Alexander Darroch’s sister. There is a reference to Sandy, known as Greusaiche because his father was a shoemaker, in the last line of An Cèardaman (q.v.)

Refrain, l. 4 <gai>Bealach na h-Airde.<eng> The old track to Balnahard Farm, which passed through the gap between the summit of Càrnan Eoin and A’ Bheinn Bheag. Nowadays the steep part of the track where it rises off the sand-dunes is known as the Bealach.

v. 1, l. 1 Sendy. Written thus to indicate phonetically the Colonsay pronunciation. An ‘a’ in the presence of a nasal consonant (‘n’ or ‘m’) is pronounced like an ‘e’. Thus anabarrach math (very good) is pronounced ‘enaprach meh’. This feature is found in other Argyll dialects, notably in Islay.

v. 1, l. 3 Peetran. Pronounced in three syllables (‘Peter-an’), this was the nickname of Neil McDougall, an estate worker who hailed from Islay.

v. 2, l. 1 <gai>Carraig Mhic Criobhan.<eng> Written thus in the MS, this is presumably the Balnahard fishing-rock named as Carraig Nic Cruimein in Murdoch McNeill’s list of placenames, included as an Appendix to John de Vere Loder’s monumental work Colonsay and Oronsay (1935, reprinted 1995). Ena Williams points out that the name MacNiven, which is known in Islay, is pronounced in its Gaelic form as if it were spelt MacCriobhain. The combination ‘cn’ is regularly pronounced ‘cr’ in Gaelic, as in cnoc.

v. 2, l. 3 <gai>seisreach.<eng> Duncan McAllister suggested this might mean a tripod used to support a fishing-rod, but other native speakers agree with the translation in Dwelly’s Dictionary, i.e. a team of horses, originally six in number (seisear), but in modern Gaelic applied to any size of team.

v. 3, l. 1 <gai>Murchadh Buie.<eng> Murdoch Buie was the farmer at Balnahard, and Sandy’s employer.

v. 3, l. 3 <gai>an abhainn.<eng> Because of its small size, Colonsay is notably deficient in

[TD 64]

fishing rivers. The reference here is probably to Abhainn a’ Mhuilinn, which flows into Kiloran Bay.

v. 4, l. 4 <gai>Gàrradh nan Sgab. Gàrradh nan Sgabag,<eng> above Port Sgibinis in Balnahard. The name, like the present participles (treabhadh, cliathadh) is truncated to fit the metre.


An t-Achmhasan (The Rebuke)

This simple piece of homely advice on the desirability of marriage is of uncertain authorship, but several Colonsay people remember it being sung at ceilidhs when they were children, so it must date from the early part of the twentieth century if not earlier. Despite the very specific reference to mac brathair m’athar in the refrain, it has not proved possible to identify the hapless bachelor to whom the rebuke is addressed.
