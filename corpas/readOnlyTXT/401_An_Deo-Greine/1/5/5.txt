<eng>GAELIC TECHNICAL TERMS.

THE following list of Gaelic Technical Terms used in farming were sent in to the Mod of 1899 by the Rev. Charles M. Robertson.

GAELIC TERMS RELATING TO GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE.

Many of the terms that at first belonged exclusively to agriculture or pastoral pursuits, have passed long since as words and figures of speech into the language and literature of the people. Others may be dialectic synonyms of well-known words or may be of a kind that that the farmer constantly employs, but that the outsider seldom or never has occasion to use. Such terms as have not been found in the Dictionaries to which access was had, are distinguished in the following pages by the names of the districts in which they are used. Terms that are used in connection with other animals as well as with cattle, are given in connection with cattle, and are rarely repeated. The use, or the dictionary definition of a word sometimes extends it to other than its proper signification, and in some cases the proper meaning only is given in the following pages.
