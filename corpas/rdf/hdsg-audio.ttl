This damaged the recording tape and when removing it the magnetic layer peeled off in some places. It appears that within this editing process the tape was overlapped before being stuck together using sellotape. The reel was hand wound and the sellotape was removed and replaced with splicing tape. Some small sections of tape had to be cut out as too badly damaged to play. Old splicing was also replaced. tape played through ok.  Tape is HTM and one side is reversed. hard to tell what side is side A as very little notes with the tape.  " ;

Looks as if originally recorded as a TTM but first 15m39s of left channel was recorded over.   Volume varies on both recordings. Splicing had to be replaced on different sections of the tape. At 7:31 previous splice was not clean two ends do not match and two breaks in a small area of tape.  At 14mins the Right Channel has some drop outs but no damage to tape,  volume increases as the mic gets closer. 3 tracks supplied.  001 is HTM up until 15:39 and TTM till end.  001_dtl has the first 15:39s of right channel duplicated to left and is now TTM (probably more representative of original recording.) 002 is the mono section to 15:39 extracted from the left channel." ;
