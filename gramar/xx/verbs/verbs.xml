  <title>verbs</title>
  <p>Verbs are words which typically refer to intangible <u>situations</u> – 
    events, states, activities, processes, changes of state &amp;c.</p>
  <p>Verbs can be divided into three <u>morphological</u> classes –</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="?xx=verbs/derived_verbs">Derived verbs</a> are understood as having been formed from adjectives or nouns, 
      typically by addition of a suffix
      eg. <m>gealaich</m> <en>whiten</en>, <m>cuimhnich</m> <en>remember</en>.</li>
    <li><a href="?xx=verbs/compound_verbs">Compound verbs</a> are understood as having been formed from other verbs,
      typically by addition of a prefix
      eg. <m>ath-sgrìobh</m> <en>rewrite</en>, <m>craobh-sgaoil</m> <en>broadcast</en>.</li>
    <li>Simple verbs are not understood as having been formed from other words 
      eg. <m>ith</m> <en>eat</en>, <m>seinn</m> <en>sing</en>.</li>
  </ul>
