BALRANALD AND PAIBLESGARRY

Balranald and Paiblesgarry lie on the west side of North Uist. Both are fairly modern crofting townships, divided up in 1921. Balranald covers an area of 830 acres, a large proportion of which is machair land. Paiblesgarry is much smaller, covering an area of 521 acres in all.


HISTORY OF BALRANALD AND PAIBLESGARRY - PRE-1921

Paiblesgarry, called in Gaelic Gearraidh Phaibil forms the southern border with Balranald Estate. The first reference we have is in 1505 when Paiblesgarry is described as “Le Terung De Paiblesgervy”.

The first reference we have to a tenant being in Paiblesgarry is that of Alexander MacDonald, son of Donald MacDonald first of Sleat. This Alexander, who flourished circa 1590-1657 had amassed considerable wealth as a tenant and his inventory included 84 cows, 56 horses, 30 pigs, and 120 sheep. He was followed at Paiblesgarry by his son Hugh and thereafter by his grandson John. This John appears in the North Uist rental of 1718. Another Donald MacDonald, also in Paiblesgarry and who appears in 1723 as a witness to a bond, was one of the Siol Ghoraidh. His son Hugh was a famous <gai>‘Seannachie’<eng>. The next tenant to be mentioned at Paiblesgarry is Margaret MacDonald, a daughter of John MacDonald who appears to have had a tack of Balranald. He was the son of William the Tutor who was closely connected to the Vallay MacDonalds. Margaret died unmarried at Paiblesgarry about 1785. Following that period Paiblesgarry was tenanted by various generations of the Balranald MacDonalds.

Balranald gets its name from Ranald, son of Godfrey, son of John of Islay and his wife Aimie Nic Ruairidh. This Ranald flourished circa 1380-1440 and lived at Balranald. The last MacDonalds were not however of this line. They were in direct line from Alexander MacDonald who had a lease of Balranald and who was drowned at Kirkibost in 1763. Five generations followed him at Balranald.

Balranald and Paiblesgarry were never actually owned by any of the MacDonalds but merely leased from their Sleat superiors until in 1894 it was brought by Alexander MacDonald (<gai>Ailig Bhaile Raghnaill<eng>) for £8,000.


[TD 7]

Prior to this his father, James MacDonald, (<gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng>), had tenanted Paiblesgarry and Balranald. He had most of the land to himself except for cottars’ houses which were usually sited on the most unproductive land, e.g. Druimdubh. A sore point with Seumas Ruadh was the fact that on one of the most fertile spots in Paiblesgarry was a cottar’s house. This house belonged to William MacDonald, (son of Angus, son of John, son of Alexander). His wife Christina (died 1853) was from Skye and worked at Balranald as a servant. Seumas Ruadh called at William’s house one day where Christina was nursing a son to whom she had recently-given birth. ‘Balranald’ asked what the boy’s name was, but he was told that this had not been decided yet. ‘Balranald’ suggested that it would be to their advantage to call the boy James, after himself. A bargain of coercion was struck there and then, the boy was named James, and as a reward James and hi older brother Angus were to be granted tenancy of neighbouring crofts in Knockintorran, (Nos 11 and 12, immediately “over the wall” from Paiblesgarry. William and his family subsequently moved to Knockintorran thus leaving Paiblesgarry as a clean tack, cottars excluded of course. ‘Balranald’ had to evict two families from Knockintorran to make way for William and his family.

Alexander, who succeeded his father <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng>, was helped by a grieve and servants who lived in tied houses in Paiblesgarry. On the machair, at the boundary of Paiblesgarry and Balranald, stood <gai>‘Tigh a’ Mhachaire’<eng>. The last tenant was John MacDonald (Iain Mac Aonghais Bhig). His main duty was to ensure that no stray sheep or cattle from Knockintorran were to wander on to Paiblesgarry. If that did happen, he would drive them along to Balranald and impound them till the owner called to collect them and paid the ‘impounding fee’. This was demanded as late as 1950.

One of Alexander’s most prominent farm managers was John MacLean (<gai>Seonaidh Mac Iain Oig<eng>) and much credit must be given to him for the running of the Estate. His father was a grieve and came from Sleat.

Being on friendly terms with township crofters, Alexander’s servants were assisted by them at harvest and peat cutting times at Balranald. Crofters also did work as payment in lieu of wintering township bulls at Balranald. Apart from servants doing general work, craftsmen, including wheelwrights, blacksmiths, and farriers were employed for periods during the winter to maintain the good running of the Estate.

It was during Alexander’s time that the standard of farming in Paiblesgarry and Balranald reached its highest peak. The Balranald bulls became world famous. In 1855 the Highland Cattle Society’s publication ‘Highland Herd Book’ enters the names, colours, etc., of the bulls. They appear throughout the book with monotonous regularity.

The bulls were generally wintered in <gai>‘Peighinn Mhor’<eng> and <gai>’Ard a Runair’<eng>, both of them on the Estate. The large herd of cattle was also wintered on Balranald machair, it being so much larger than Paiblesgarry. A large byre, <gai>‘Bathach a’ Mhachaire’<eng> stood due west of <gai>‘Drochaid Ghousgaidh’<eng> on Balranald machair and was the winter storehouse for the cattle.

Paiblesgarry machair grew most of the Estate’s wintering fodder. The machair was heavily fertilised by seaweed every winter and almost all used for cropping. Away from the barley and turnip fields a number of sheep, which did not feature as much as cattle, were kept on the hard hill ground.


[TD 8]

In addition to cattle and sheep a number of horses were kept also. With a few exceptions the horses didn’t feature as prizewinners at shows. An exception was ‘Islesman’ known as ‘Aigeach Iain Bhain’, which was bred by John MacAulay, Burnbank, Knockintorran. The ‘Islesman’ was a grandson of ‘Bain’s’ stallion. (Bain was a contractor who came to Uist in 1872, bringing with him a dark brown stallion). This legendary stallion was bought by MacKenzie of Calgary, Mull, and won world wide fame eventually ending up in South America, in Argentina.

All in all Alexander was a very well respected member of the North Uist community and had the advantage of being a good Gaelic speaker.

His only son, Ronald, who succeeded him, had however a totally·different upbringing having been sent at an early age to the south. He spoke with a short clipped English accent thus segregating himself unintentionally from the islanders. Ronald was not a farmer like his father, but followed a career in the army, rising to the rank of captain in the late 1920s. Known as Raghnall Mor, he was a good looking tall man who never married and who never managed to integrate into a crofting society. To a simple people his father’s title of <gai>‘Fear a’ Bhaile’<eng> was far more congenial than ‘Captain MacDonald’.


LAND RAID – 1921

BALRANALD ESTATE

Here follows Angus MacAulay’s account - it is a translation from Gaelic, an account told by him in 1975.

‘There isn’t any man of my generation who has not heard of the recruitment of young men, on the outbreak of the First World War, for, as we used to say, Kitchener’s first 100,000. This forms the basis for the story.

The majority of the Uist boys were in the Militia as we used to say or in the special reserves. There were not many who joined Kitchener’s regiments. To encourage men to join the regiments however, the government, well aware of the qualities of a Highland soldier, passed an act stating that, at the end of the war, returning soldiers were to have land worth living on.

After the war some of us returned home. We wrote to the Department of Agriculture and the Scottish Land Court informing them that we wanted a particular land, i.e. Paiblesgarry and Balranald.


[TD 9]

I might as well mention at this point that only three of the Balranald estate workers were recruited for the First World War. On the other hand there were scores of young men recruited from the neighbourhood. On application for the land the only acknowledgement we received was a printed postcard - with this we were far from satisfied.

There was a general election imminent.·Some of us went to a·meeting in Bayhead School, where the Liberal M.P. - a Dr. Murray_ was present. After the meeting we met him and told him of our dissatisfaction with our enquiries for land. He told us vehemently that we would never acquire a plot of land unless we raided it.

Shortly afterwards twelve of us went to Balranald House and told ‘Balranald’ (Captain MacDonald), that we were going to raid his land. ‘Balranald’ quickly produced a pen and paper to get our names, but nobody waited for that! On the day after we informed ‘Balranald’ of our intentions, we came from Balemore, but some were from Knockintorran and Knockline too.

There was: Roderick MacDonald (<gai>Ruairidh Iain Mhic Ruairidh<eng>), Knockline, 32 years; Norman Laing (<gai>Tormod Lionc<eng>), Balemore, 50 years; Donald E. MacDonald (<gai>Domhnall Eoghainn Aonghais Bhig<eng>), Balemore, 22 years; Alex. MacRury (<gai>Ailig Iain Bhig<eng>), Balemore, 32 years; Donald MacDonald (<gai>Domhnall Dhomhnaill Eoghainn<eng>), Balemore, 23 years; Donald Matheson (<gai>Domhnall Eoghainn Dhomhnaill Bhain<eng>), Knockintorran, 32 years; Alasdair MacDonald (<gai>Alasdair Mac Iain<eng>), Knockintorran, 32 years; Archibald Ferguson (<gai>Gilleasbuig Iain Mhic Fhearghuis<eng>), Knockintorran, 30 years; John Alick MacAulay (<gai>Seonaidh Ailig Neill<eng>), Knockintorran, 24 years; Ewen MacLean (<gai>Eoghainn Thormoid<eng>), Balemore, 36 years; John MacDonald (<gai>Iain an Eilean<eng>), Knockintorran, 48 years; Angus MacAulay (<gai>Aonghas Ailig an t-Saoir<eng>), Balemore, 24 years.

Led by Donald Ewen MacDonald on the pipes we headed for Paiblesgarry and started dividing Paiblesgarry into plots.

The following day Captain MacDonald - <gai>Raghnall Mor<eng> - started seaweeding along with his servants. On filling their carts, we approached them and overturned all the carts. I remember distinctly that it was Gilleasbuig Mac Raghnaill’s cart I overturned. Gilleasbuig, who had a son who had been to war, was sympathetic and said to me, ‘Well done’. Maybe the other servants of Balranald were not so sympathetic as Gilleasbuig in seeing ‘Balranald’ beaten that day.

The next day they returned to the seaweed and so did we! Captain MacDonald thinking he would frighten or deter us came on horseback. We sent the servants back to Balranald followed by all the sheep and cattle on Paiblesgarry. All of us felt that we were now in control of Paiblesgarry.

An interim interdict was issued by the Sheriff Clerk at Lochmaddy, (this was issued on 5th January, 1921). We were not allowed near the land we had raided, but we did not take any heed - we in fact burned the notices.

We were eventually summoned to court and there was plenty of discussion as to whether to attend or not. We decided to attend. By now we were being advised by a lawyer, a Mr. Shaw from Edinburgh, who was sympathetic to our cause. He did not attend the court in Lochmaddy.


[TD 10]

On the day of the court, 21st March, 1921, a Mr. Peter MacNeil, who had done some studying law came to help us. As each person went into the stand he advised me on what questions to ask them. One of the questions asked to Captain MacDonald was, ‘Where are your title deeds?’ On that day we did not care what the outcome would be - we knew the land would be ours.

We were sent to serve 60 days in prison, without the option of a fine. The situation was ludicrous - we were allowed home because there was no cell big enough in Lochmaddy for such a contingent!

On returning home, two of us, Donald MacDonald and myself, made arrangements to join the Territorials. It had been suggested that it would be beneficial to our case if we still showed some allegiance to the Crown. So we two idiots joined the ‘Terries’ in Inverness. Whilst in Inverness the police arrived in Paible to arrest the others and some were sought on the machairs. We got a letter from Uist stating that the raiders’ were on their way to Inverness prison. A crowd of us went to meet them at Inverness Railway Station, where a man stood prominently on a couple of boxes announcing the raiders arrival and giving much publicity to their cause.

Next morning two policemen came to arrest us in the camp. A crowd of Skye boys surrounded us and prevented anyone from getting near us. There followed an uproar, until General Sandilands announced that he could not be of any assistance. ‘Civil law surpasses military law in this respect’. He could not prevent our arrest.

Dressed as we were in our kilts, we proceeded to prison where we were told ‘that it was a disgrace to wear the King’s uniform in prison’.

We were stripped of our kilts, tobacco and matches and given the prison garb. We got individual cells. Our breakfast the next day consisted of a kind of bun - nothing in it but air, a miserable cup of tea and thin, thin porridge! My appetite was lost for two or three days.

Soon we were taken out to the wide corridor outside our cells, where I noticed Norman Laing, one of the raiders, who, being of a small stature, did not look at my face and certainly did not recognise me in my prison garb. He turned to Donald Ewen MacDonald and said, “Look at this Irishman beside me. <gai>Nach ann air a tho coltas an uamhais<eng>”. Donald went into convulsions. Norman Laing had a second look at me, and gazing at my garb asked, “Where in the name of creation did you get that outfit?” I replied, “You wait, tomorrow you will have the same attire yourself!” If it was possible for one to get a weekly change of clothes one could keep one’s own clothing, but in this situation that was impossible for all of us.

The next day the warden, a Skye man, took myself and Donald MacDonald out for a walk. The warden found his job rather distasteful and was sympathetic towards us. We were some spectacle to behold - you should have seen me in my prison garb. On one stocking was one yellow stripe and on the other two stripes. The trousers were tied with tape at the knees. The army boots seemed to be newly patched. The jacket, which felt like velvet, was such a bad fit for me that it seemed to fasten up near my nostrils! With this outfit, topped with a Glengarry type bonnet I must have looked a sight and so did Donald MacDonald!


[TD 11]

As we circled inside the prison walls I heard this door and who was first to appear but Norman Laing. With the army boots and strange stockings he looked a sight - his three inch beard did not become him either. Norman shouted, “Come on, let’s get out of here”. One by one came out - it was comical. lain an Eilein appeared, a big, somewhat stout, man with the jacket up to his chin. Roderick MacDonald with size 11 boots walking more awkwardly than ever.

The prison governor was kind to us. He was helpful and congenial. Whenever a letter arrived for us from our lawyer he would get us all together for discussion. Our lawyer ordered us not to sign any document without his permission. Stand fast and firm was his order.

At times we were fed up doing nothing, so when we were asked ‘outside’ to help with the building of nearby cottages, we were delighted. One day when we were helping with the building I asked Norman Laing how he found the food. I said I reckoned I would be dead without my daily portion of cheese. “Cheese!”, exclaimed Norman, “I am not getting a morsel”. (It was the order of the day to supply prisoners over 12 stones in weight with a daily portion of cheese). “You’d better watch in case one of the other prisoners is stealing it from you”, I told him.

The next day there was this ‘hurly-burly’ outside my cell, and the warden opened my door and told me to come quickly. There was Norman Laing attacking one of the other prisoners, not a raider, and accusing him of stealing his cheese. I helped the warden in separating them and indeed we all found the incident to be hilarious.

We were in prison for 16 days and they are numbered as some of the happiest days of my life. I was regularly brought to my knees with laughter - looking at some with overgrown beards, others salivating because of the absence of tobacco. Indeed I was sometimes feeling physically sick with such laughter.

During our stay in prison we had a really kind gentleman and friend visiting us regularly. He was well aware of all prison regulations and on his visits he made sure he had a good quantity of chewing tobacco. Norman Laing was exceptionally keen on smoking tobacco, so when he got some chewing tobacco he not only chewed it, but swallowed it too! It came as little surprise, therefore, when one day he was heard retching violently.

Eventually a letter arrived from our lawyer for us stating that the raided land was going to be ours. “<gai>Cha b’e ruith ach leum!<eng>” Arrangements for our release were in progress.

We congregated in a big room in the prison where we were issued with our own clothing. Norman Laing grabbed his waistcoat and on finding his pipe, proceeded to light it and immediately a warden grabbed it from his mouth. We were issued with one group ticket for our journey home and that meant we would have to stay together.

On our arrival at Inverness Station, Norman Laing said he wanted to ’phone his son Archie in Edinburgh, so that he could forward some cash to Kyle. I went with him to the Post Office and the arrangements were made.


[TD 12]

While we were making these arrangements an agent from the Liberal Party had arrived and given 15/- (75p) each to the raiders at the station. The raiders duly shared their amount with us - we now had an extra few shillings to spend. When we arrived home, the land which we had seized, tilled and planted had been well looked after by our friends.

Soon the Department of Agriculture were communicating with us and plans were drawn up for the division of Paiblesgarry and Balranald into eight crofts each. The numbers were put into a hat and we each withdrew a number. There were two people in Paiblesgarry who had made an application for land but who had not taken part in the raid, and they too got permission to draw from the hat. Although some of the raiders chose crofts in Balranald the majority chose Paiblesgarry - with which we were more familiar.

We had obtained the land and we had our crofts. There was hard work before us. We erected the barns and byres first. The Department supplied us with blasting powder to uproot the vast amount of stones for our buildings. There were numerous dry-stone dykes from the era before which came in handy. I slept in the barn for two years until I built my house - this was what happened in most cases.

The land no longer was Raghnall Mor’s. Was it not from a poor people that his predecessors had taken it in the first place?<gai>

A UIST TRADITION

<gai>Aonghas Ailig an t-Saoir<eng> concluded his narrative on the Balranald raids with these words, “The land no longer was Raghnall Mor’s. Was it not from a poor people his predecessors had taken it in the first place?” According to oral tradition poverty indeed they had been reduced to.

Having spent my early childhood in neighbouring Hougharry I remember the older generation talking about the incident which was a general topic of conversation. On reflection was it perhaps the ‘now it can be told era’.

Apparently John, second son of Ranald, who succeeded his brother, Alexander, who died in 1460, without issue, was not well acquainted with the island. His son Donald managed Balranald and his other son Godfrey held Vallay.

Due to his lifestyle John was reputed to have acquired heavy debts and was pressurised by his creditors. Pressure eased but on his death it was revealed that he had bequeathed everything to John, Lord of the Isles, Earl of Ross. It was maintained that the latter had paid his debts and in return he got not only the land but the coveted Lordship of Uist. He bestowed the latter on his half-brother Hugh of Sleat but this was never accepted by the Crown.

Thus began the Overlordship of Sleat in North Uist - a time of turmoil and unrest. Members of the same family skirmishing among themselves over territorial rights with bloodshed and acts of vengeance. Somerled would have wept.

Donald, son of John, who was married to a daughter of Ronald Ban Allanson, 12th Chief of Clan Ranald, was now reduced to having Balranald on rent as tenant of Sleat. This displeased all members of Clan Donald and the MacDonalds of Keppoch invited him to take over the chieftainship of their branch but one other member of the family was nearer to the claim but Donald was given lands in Lochaber where he stayed for the rest of his life.

The Lordship of the Isles did not last. Internal and external pressures began to work on it. Clan Donald became disunited and the aforementioned Lord of the Isles, Earl of Ross, had to surrender all his titles and lands in 1493. His lands went to the Crown and Sleat became leaseholders and were no longer owners. This continued until the Balranald Raiders had their say - <gai>Na Gillean Grinn<eng>, who reclaimed the land of their fathers.

Was Alexander, son of Ranald, who died in 1460, the last Overlord to live among the people until the Earl and Countess Granville took up residence here?

Before the present house was built there was a thatched house on this croft, which was said to have been built around 1880. This house went on fire and the roof had to be replaced. All the local people helped to replace the roof. The present house was built in 1939 by Angus MacAulay (<gai>Aonghas Ailig an t-Saoir<eng>), Paiblesgarry. In 1964 it was extended by Angus MacKenzie (<gai>Aonghas Mhic Anndra<eng>), Hougharry. The area on which this house is built is called <gai>Druim na h-Uamha<eng> (Ridge of the Cave). At one point contractors decided to excavate here, but on finding crockery and bones they decided to come to a halt.

The croft is bordered on one side by <gai>Loch a’ Mhaoir.<eng>

At present the house is occupied by Angus John MacLellan, his wife Chrissie and their family. His mother Mary and brother Alick also stay there.

After 1921, Raghnall Mor was left with <gai>Gearraidh an Fhidhleir<eng>, and the area around his house. He maintained his dominance but mostly over youngsters who intruded the garden for apples, or over trespassers seeking lapwings’ eggs on his now diminished acreage.

In the 1950s he sold the house and contents. His sister Eva, a keen horsewoman, who stayed longer than the rest of her sisters at Balranald, was by this time married at ‘Vausary Cottage’, Scone.

Captain MacDonald died and was buried in Scone. There was no apparent heir.

‘Balranald’ took the gun and placed it on a hillock near Balranald House and hence it has been called <gai>‘Cnoc a’ Ghunna’<eng>. The ruins of ‘Tigh Cnoc a’ Ghunna’ are still there.

JESSIE OF BALRANALD - <gai>SEASAIDH BHAILE RAGHNAILL<eng>

One of the most well known stories regarding Balranald House is that of the elopement of Jessie Catherine MacDonald of Balranald, North Uist, and Donald MacDonald of Monkstadt, Skye. Jessie was one of six daughters of James Thomas MacDonald of Lynedale, Skye, and Balranald, North Uist. <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng>, as he was known, was factor of North Uist at that time. Jessie’s mother was Jane, daughter of Captain MacKenzie of Hartfield. Donald was a son of Hugh Peter MacDonald of Monkstadt, Skye, and who was closely connected to the MacDonalds of Sleat.

Jessie and Donald first met and fell in love in Skye where <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> was factor for Lord MacDonald. Although Donald’s family was well-off, as a younger son in a family of eleven he had no immediate prospects of gaining prominence in any sphere – something which <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> desired in a suitor for his daughter.

When <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> and his family moved to North Uist, Jessie was forbidden to see Donald, but they however managed to stay in touch through Jessie’s maid who was from Skye. <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> was factor in North Uist until in 1849 he temporarily gave up his position. It was Donald of Monkstadt who was brought to Uist to take up his position. While factor he visited the MacDonald home and saw Jessie often.

During his time a new Chamberlain was appointed - a Patrick Cooper from the East coast of Scotland. He had cause to visit the home of <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> frequently, where he fell in love with Jessie and wanted to marry her. Jessie’s parents were pleased with such a match for their daughter. Cooper and Jessie’s parents realised that Donald was still a candidate and thus dismissed him as factor. <gai>Seumas Ruadh<eng> resumed factorship. Despite Jessie’s protestations, wedding arrangements for her to marry Cooper commenced.

In despair, Jessie sent word to Donald that unless he acted speedily she would have to marry Patrick Cooper. Donald sent off a speedy reply advising Jessie of his intentions to come and take her away on a certain night. This night was the night that Balranald House was celebrating the forthcoming marriage of Jessie and Cooper. A lit candle in Jessie’s room window was to be the sign that she was ready for the great escape.

At this time two of the Balranald maid servants were Lexie MacDonald, Carinish, and Mary Ferguson, Knockintorran. Having been informed by Jessie of her plans, it was probably why, with their assistance, the first stage of Jessie’s elopement was so successful. Mary Ferguson’s young brother Angus was sent as a lookout on that night by <gai>Seumas Ruadh.<eng> Was this suspicion on his part that something sinister was going on or was it the usual procedure to have a sentry on nights of celebration. When the Skyemen arrived at Balranald House they gagged and bound young Angus - he may have been expecting them.

Jessie escaped down a ladder from her window - the upper south west window. They headed for the boat which was probably at Lochmaddy. Their destination was to be Skye. The weather crossing to North Uist had been favourable, but as they made their way back to Skye the weather changed. The boat was driven off course and at daybreak they were just off the Sound of Harris, where they eventually grounded the boat at Rodil.


[TD 44]

The nearby inhabitants saw this boat and immediatley went to their assistance. Unfortunately for Jessie, one of these people happened to be her uncle, John Robertson MacDonald. They were shown hospitality in Rodil House, where Jessie was kept under surveillance by her aunt.

Meanwhile, back at Balranald House, Cooper and his men were dispatched in all directions to seek Jessie and eventually the searchers arrived in Rodil. By now the original boat had returned to Skye.

A bigger vessel was obtained and they set off from Skye to rescue Jessie once again. This time Donald and his friends knew that the task ahead would be somewhat more difficult. Despite guards supervision and lookouts Jessie was rescued from Cooper and his small group of helpers who had traced her to Rodil.

The boat set sail for the mainland and landed at Gairloch, home of Jessie’s mother. From there Jessie and Donald made for Glasgow, where they got married, and subsequently left for Australia.

In Australia Donald and Jessie raised a family on their remote farm called “Balranald”. Here they were involved in a somewhat different type of drama. It has been said that one day Jessie was kidnapped by a bushranger. Donald, having been made aware of the kidnap, galloped off on horseback to this man’s abode where he arrived before them and killed the kidnapper.

Latterly Donald and Jessie sadly separated. Jessie died at her home ‘Hartfield’ in 1896. Memories of <gai>Seasaidh Bhaile Raghnaill<eng> live on in story and song.

An sin thuirt Cooper ri Ailig,
“Dean cabhag ’s na dean moill,
Gheibh thu crodh is baile fearann,
Faigh mo leannan ’s i air chall.

Gheibh thu coach agus each siubhlach,
Cuir srian dùbailte ’na cheann,

Chorus

Hail to you, good health to you,
This greeting now I send you,
Hail to you, good health to you.

Then up spoke Cooper to Alick,
“Now hurry on your way;
You'll get cattle and good farm land,
Find my sweetheart who is lost.

Get a coach and horse that’s lively,
Double bridle on his head,
Then go search the whole of Harris,
Travel it from end to end.”

Fhuair e soirbheas nach robh gann,
Fhuair e sealladh air an iùbhrach,

An sin thuirt Maighstir Dhomhnull

Seisd

Failte dhuit, deagh shlàinte leat,

Failte dhuit, deagh shlàinte leat.


Alick left in early morning,
Drove the horse its swiftest pace;
Then he came in sight of Rodil,
Saw the Eliza under sail.

When he did arrive in Rodil,
There the breeze was blowing strong,
And he saw the good ship sailing,
That was causing Cooper’s loss.

Then whispered Master Donald,
“Now Jessie, don’t you be sad;
Bre two Sundays have gone by,
We’ll be married happily.”

Ne’er was seen such ‘hurly-burly’,
Climbing and descending stairs,
Locks were broken, doors burst open,
Got her out in spite of all.

Then cried out the factor Cooper,
Leaded pistol in his hand,
First in English, then in Gaelic,
“Who is there?” and “Co sud ann?”

Gallant youth from us departing,
This is my fervent wish for you,
Pleasant trip and safe arrival,
At the place to which you’ve sailed.

As you sailed beyond Rudh’ Hunish
Sad was I that you had left,
And until you will return here,
May good fortune be your lot.

Chorus

Hail to you, good health to you,
This greeting now I send you
Hail to you, good health to you.

AN AUTUMN MEAL ON BALRANALD MACHAIR c. 1850

It was autumn time, and ‘Balranald’ was recruiting young servants. Tormod Mac Mhurchaidh, one of the Knockintorran Fergusons, was one of them.

On his first day of employment, ‘Balranald’ appeared with his horse and cart. It was mealtime. ‘Balranald’ tipped his cart - into one pile fell the salt herring, into another the boiled potatoes. Self-Service ‘off the ground’ was the order of the day.

Tormod went home and related the days events to Murdo his father. Murdo was perturbed. He himself, though poor and destitute would not treat his fellow humans like animals. He did not allow his son to go to work the second day.

On realising that Norman was not working the second day, ‘Balranald’ arrived at his father’s house on horseback, it being the usual method of transport and demanded to know the reason why Tormod was not at his work. Murdo declared that he refused to have his son fed in animal fashion. ‘Balranald’ assured Murdo that the practice would be altered - he would give plates to Norman and his fellow workers.

BELLA MATHESON - A MYSTERIOUS ENCOUNTER AT BALRANALD

For most of her life Bellag stayed at home with her parents, but for some time she worked on the lighthouses. It was during this time away from home that she became friendly with a mainlander - a Highlander. He arrived one day to Bellag’s house, where she now worked in her shop. With him he had a big chest which suggested that he was going to be there for a considerable time. After a week seemingly, he fled, stating that he had to attend to some emergency. He stated that he’d probably return within a week.

Weeks and months passed and Bellag’s friend did not appear. His chest was still in the bedroom. It was still full as Bellag could not move it one inch. After several months she decided to open the chest in case there was any clue to his mysterious disappearance. On opening the chest it was found to be empty and nailed to the floor. He did not return.

During the second World War however, a stranger came and pitched a tent near Bellag’s house. He visited Bellag’s house daily. It was rather unusual at that time for campers to come to the island so the locals were rather curious as to who he was. Bellag was not forthcoming with any information. She pled ignorance to who he was and where he was from. Bellag never revealed the camper’s identity and hence the locals were convinced that this was her former friend revisiting.

It has been said that the nailed chest was never removed from its original position. It remained there after Bellag’s death, and the house now lies in ruins.

It was in this state when a local boy visited the site and saw something gleaming in the sun. He found a Luckenbooth brooch. It had been customary in Bellag’s time, for a gentleman to give this to his lady when they became engaged. The initials on the back read F. D. McL. to I. M. It seems that Isabella Matheson had indeed intended to marry.

<gai>SEUMAS DÒMHNULLACH FEAR BHAILE RÀGHAILL

’S gur a mise tha duilich,
’S mor mo mhulad ’s an uair so,
O’n a chuala mi ’n naidheachd,
Nach maireann fear m’fhuasglaidh,
Gur e Fear Bhaile-Ràghaill,
Tha mi ’g radh an sàr uasal,
E bhi ’na laighe ’s a’ chaibeal,
Ann an cadal gun gluasad.

Fear t’eugaisg cha’n fhaic mi,
Ann am maise ’s an uaisle,
Cha robh uireasbhuidh dealbh ort,
’S bu neo-chearbach do ghluasad,
Ann a’ sgoltadh a’ cheartais,
Co an neach a fhuair buaidh ort,
’S mor an call anns a tìr so,
Thu bu ’bhi na t-shìneadh ’s an uair so.

Bu tu bàillidh na tuatha,
Nach bu chruaidh an àm eigin,
Ann an toiseach a’ ghanntair,
’S gun neach ann dheanadh feum dhaibh,
Bha do sporan gun chruaidh - shnaim,
’S rinn thu fuasgladh bha feumail,
’S mur biodh tu ’s an aite,
Gun do bhàsaich na ceudan.

Chuid de’n t-sluagh a bha tuigseach,
’S a thuigeadh an ceartas,
Thug iadsan mor speis dhuit,
’S bu tu fein an cùl-taice,
Ach luchd an droch ghiùlain,
Luchd an spùileadh ’s na braide,
Theicheadh iad do na cùilean,
Ro’n t-sùil a bha smachdail.

Tha do mhac ann a d’àite,
’S mor an gràdh thug thu fein da,
’S e mo ghuidhe ’s mo dhùrachd,
Anns gach cùis a bhi steidheil,
E bhi rianail ’na chleachdadh,
’S e bhi smachdail mar dh’ fheumas,
Is e chuimhneachadh tràthail,
Gun tàrr e ’nad dheidh sa.

Tha am bàs ri bhi teachd oirnn,
Le deagh reachd air a steidheadh,
’S cha ’n fhaodar a sheachnadh,
Le neach tha fo ’n ghrein so,
’Nuair thig am dhuinn bhi siubhal,
Air slighe na deuchainn,
Cha dean eòlas no tuigse,
No lighichean, feum dhuinn.

Cio am fàth bhi fo mhulad,
Cha dean tuireadh dad feum dhuinn,
’S ann tha aobhar bhi subhach,
’Nan tuigeamaid fein e,
B’e dearbh bharail na muinntir,
A bha dlùth dhuit ’nuair dh’ eug thu,
Gun deach thu chum glòire,
’S tha mise ’n dòchas nach breug sud.<eng>

<gai>ORAN DO SHEASAIDH BHAILE RÀGHAILL

Fonn

An t-apran goirid ’s an t-apran ùr,
An t-apran goirid nach ruig ach a’ ghlùin,
Nuair bha mi òg ’s mi mireadh ri m’rùn,
’Se dh’fhàg mi bho leon, ach an t-apran ùr.

Bha cliu ort a Sheasaidh ’s tu ’n ainnir bha suairc,
A chumadh ri d’ghealladh ’sa leanadh ri d’luaidh,
’S ann annad bha spiorad ’s tu chinneadh nan buadh,
Nach gabhadh an giorag ’s nach tilleadh roimh ’n chuan.

Sann ort a bha biùthas ’san duthaich a bha ann,
Cha ghabhadh tu Cooper, cha buidh leat a’ chainnt,
’Sann bha thu ’nad bhiutaidh, ’s tu ’m flur gun mheang,
’S ’nam faighinn mo dhùrachd, bhitheadh Diùc leat air laimh.

Nuair·fhuair an Eliza, Seasaidh air bòrd,
’S ann oirre bha’n sgoinn ’s iad a’ haoisteadh nan seòl,
Bha muir air gach taobh dhi a’ sgaoileadh mu bòrd,
’S bha ’n fhairge cho aotram ri faoileig air lòn.

Bha seòrsa duine aca mach air a ‘watch’,
A gearrd a’ bhaile, ’s na thigeadh mun cuairt,
Ach cheangladh a’ chasan ’s a làmhan gu cruaidh,
’S mun tàinig a mhaduinn chaidh a ragadh le fuachd.

Dh’fhàg thu do mhàthair bho leòn,
Nach do rinn iad dhut banais le aighear is ceòl,
Ach tillidh tu fhathast do Uibhist an eòrn,
’S bidh siucar an gloinne ’s todaidh ’ga òl.

SIONAIG OIG BHAILE-RAGHNALL

Anns a’ mhaduinn chiùin Cheitein,
’S a’ ghrian ag eirigh le dearrsadh,
Tilgeadh lainntir ’s na speuraibh,
’S na neòil a’ treigsinn nan àrd-bheann,
’S aoibhneach glinn agus sleibhtean,
Gach aon chreutair ri mànran,
’S nàdur àit dol na h-eideadh,
’S i sior ghleusadh a clàrsaich.

Chluinn mi torman nan stuadh,
A’ tighinn o chuan nan tonn gàireach,
A’ luth mhire ’s a’ cluaineas,
Air raona luaighte ’na tràghad,
Ceòl is binne cha chuala,
’S cha chluinn mo chluasan gu bràth e,
Na guth ainnir a bhuair mi,
Sineag uasal nam blàth-shùil.

Chluinn mi ’n uiseag bheag cheòlar,
Chluinn mi ’n smeòrach le cheile,
Chluinn mi ’n lach air an lònan,
’S na h-aighean òga ri geumnaich,
Chluinn mi bhanarach bhòidheach,
A muigh ri fògairt na spreidhe,
Gach aon le mire na h-òige,
A’ seinn an òrain gun eislein.

Ach cia mar sheinneas mis òran,
A m’ shuidhe m’ sheòmar ’s gun bhlàths ann,
Gun mhnaoi gun nighean gun òig-fhear,
Gun leanabh òg gun cheòl gàire,
Cha robh riamh on a thòisich,
Breith is pòsadh is bàs ann,
Fear nach cinneadh dha sòlas,
Le nighinn òig bheireadh gràdh dha.

A Charra-chruim tha thu gòrach,
Threig an òige gu bràth thu,
Thuit an aois ort a dh’ fhògair,
Gach mais is eòlas is àgh uat,
C’uim an truaigh nach do phòs thu,
’Nuair bha thu òg ri Beinn Mhàiri,
No ri Mairibheal cheòlar,
Le sliosan bòidheach ’s le blàthan?

A Charra-chruim tha thu gòrach,
’S tha mise gòrach tha làmh ruit,
Ag amharc sios air Loch Hòstadh,
Le cheile ’s brònach ar càradh,
B’fhearr leam fhein na mo chòta,
Mo spreidh, mo stòras, ’s m’airneis,
Gu’n robh mi’n ceangal a’ phòsaidh,
Ri Sionaig Òig Bhaile-Raghnaill.

C’àite ’m facas air fòd,
Ag imeachd òg-bhean as àille,
Slios mar eal’ air an lòn,
Is beul is boidhche ni gàire,
Cha robh maise bh’air òigh,
O’n bha Eubha pòsda ri Adhamh,
Nach ’eil co-misgte còmhladh,
An Sionaig Oig Bhaile Ràghnall.

Fios gu m’ charaid ’s m’ fhear-eòlais
Tha ’n diugh na ònar mar b’àbhaist,
Maighstir Iain MacDhòmhnuill,
Gur mor a ghòraich ’s an t-ànrath,
Dha fein le cinnt agus dhomhsa,
Bhi cho fad gun phosadh ’s a tha sinn,
’S lionmhor tubaist ’s droch còdhail,
Tha lorg ar seòrsa ’s gach àite.<eng>
